(expected in 10.1.2 or 10.2?) includes an [advanced termination handling](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/2035) logic which is more elegant than calling [`unbind`](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/938264b60302ddb978b2a02ebe5d84c4ae31c490/framework/src/play-akka-http-server/src/main/scala/play/core/server/AkkaHttpServer.scala#L402).\r\n\r\nThe gist of it is that it:\r\n\r\n * unbinds, blocking new connections\r\n * starts a timeout allowing ongoing requests to finish, but when timeout kicks in an automatic `503` response is sent back.\r\n * automatically responds `503` to requests incoming on existing connections\r\n *
