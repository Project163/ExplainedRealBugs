I started the app but play was asking me to apply the script over and over again with no error messages. I finally figured out that the problem is the `play_evolutions` table. The type of `apply_script` is text, which in MySQL has a max length of 64kb. My schema and data is around 74k causing everything to fail. When I manually changed the type of the column to MEDIUNTEXT everything worked.\n\nI initially tried to break up the script so every piece was small enough but since play concatenates them into a single evolution that obviously didn't help.I'm not seeing a decent workaround for this. At the very least it an error message would be helpful.
