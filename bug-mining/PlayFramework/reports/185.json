There is no way to change that. I don't like this approach, since even when running tests I don't want to expose my app to the whole world.\r\n\r\nWe can already change the port a test server is running on by using the system property `testserver.port`:\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/9a1138bce538aa68fdf19ced7ce3b55064aeb62d/testkit/play-test/src/main/scala/play/api/test/Helpers.scala#L138-L142\r\n\r\nIMHO we should allow to do the same with the address. I think it would even make sense to allow to set the address by reading a env variable like we already do with `PLAY_HTTP_ADDRESS` (with fallback to the sys property), which let's you set the address in dev and prod mode (however I probably would use `PLAY_TEST_HTTP_ADDRESS` for this case)","closed_by":{"login":"mkurz","id":644927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDkyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/644927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz","html_url":"https://github.com/mkurz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/10927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/10927/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
