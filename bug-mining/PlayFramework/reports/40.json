Since the `delegate.call` expects the `Context`, we build it like this (it's immutable now):\n\n```\nContext newContext = new Http.Context(context.request().withUsername(usr));\nreturn this.delegate.call(newContext);\n```\n\nHowever, when we call `request()` in the controller, the request username is null. \n\nJust to be clear, we are building our own authenticating action. Using the setUsername, everything works, and has worked, as it should. \n","closed_by":{"login":"marcospereira","id":4576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira","html_url":"https://github.com/marcospereira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4706/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
