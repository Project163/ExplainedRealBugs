not sure if this is a bug or not, but it is surprising behaviour.  If I do the following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nOk.withHeaders(\"Link\" -> \"\"\"<http://example.com/some/url>; rel=\"next\"\"\"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe double quotes from around the `next` get stripped before it reaches the client, which receives the following header:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLink: <http://example.com/some/url>; rel=next\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically, this is compliant with [RFC-5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988), but it's odd that the server isn't sending what I'm telling it to send. If I have a non compliant client (which I do, it expects the quotes), it makes it impossible for me to send a link header that the client can parse. Fortunately in this case I control the client, but that might not always be the case.","closed_by":{"login":"marcospereira","id":4576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira","html_url":"https://github.com/marcospereira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
