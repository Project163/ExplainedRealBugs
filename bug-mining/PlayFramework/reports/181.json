2.6.x scala\r\n\r\nSince play-ws has now been migrated to a standalone project (`play-ws-standalone`) it is expected that libraries will start depending on that instead of `play-ws` to reduce their dependencies and allowing use outside of play\r\n\r\nThis underlying `StandaloneWSClient` is however not accessible in play when using `AhcWSComponents` (or Guice?)\r\n\r\nIt would be great if AhcWSComponents would also expose the standalone client.\r\n```scala\r\nlazy val standaloneWsClient: StandaloneWSClient = ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nkairosdb-scala -> play-ws-standalone\r\nmyPlayApp -> kairosdb-scala\r\n\r\nWhen creating an instance of the KairosDB client I need a StandaloneWSClient.
