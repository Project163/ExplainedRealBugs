Key Rotation is super-important\r\n\r\n[Key rotation](https://blog.gitguardian.com/api-key-rotation-best-practices/) is an important security practice which ideally should be performed frequently, and automated. The longer a key lives, the more likely it is to be exfiltrated, or be in the possession of employees who have since left your organisation - so if you rotate your keys once a year, how  many people will have left the company in that time? If you rotate your keys more frequently, how frequently can you perform rotation before rejected session cookies or CRSF tokens become a noticeable user problem?\r\n\r\n### Key Rotation without downtime is possible!\r\n\r\nSupporting secret rotation without downtime means that there are periods of time when tokens may acceptably be signed with either the old secret or the new secret, both of which should be accepted for verification during a reasonable overlap period (eg, 2 hours) before new tokens can have been issued to all users. Consequently, all code that consumes the secret to perform signing/verifying (eg `SessionCookieBaker`, `CSRFTokenSigner`) requires access to:\r\n\r\n- the _current_ active secret (not the one that was active when the app started)\r\n- any _other_ secrets which are also currently _acceptable_ for the purpose of verifying tokens\r\n\r\n### `play-secret-rotation` does key rotation for Play...\r\n\r\n[`guardian/play-secret-rotation`](https://github.com/guardian/play-secret-rotation) is a Scala add-on for Play that supports rotating the Play [Application Secret](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/3.0.x/ApplicationSecret) on an active cluster of servers without downtime or user-facing errors. Guardian servers rotate their Application Secret **every 6 hours**, without downtime.\r\n\r\nOther Play users are interested in adopting secret-rotation too:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/10911\r\n* https://github.com/guardian/play-secret-rotation/issues/427\r\n* https://groups.google.com/g/play-framework/c/M4Ahtfwen2E/m/tZjtjUc-Uh8J\r\n\r\n### ...but being an add-on is not easy\r\n\r\nOverriding the necessary parts of Play as an add-on to ensure that _everything_ correctly supports key rotation is tricky, because obviously Play's codebase is written with the assumption that the Application Secret is a **single** immutable value - fixing the problem is not as simple as [swapping out `CookieSigner`](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/10911#issuecomment-863654167), because in [`play.api.BuiltInComponents`](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/ea342d8b01125b538a37ed38be800c4241c49f53/core/play/src/main/scala/play/api/Application.scala#L225) there's just [one](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/ea342d8b01125b538a37ed38be800c4241c49f53/core/play/src/main/scala/play/api/Application.scala#L332) [`CookieSigner`](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/ea97026a71db35ac4dcb0d312fa6370fbbe035d9/core/play/src/main/scala/play/api/libs/crypto/CookieSigner.scala#L18-L54), with one secret, and the classes that use it would need to perform verification using _multiple_ secrets.\r\n\r\nConsequently, for `play-secret-rotation` and its [`RotatingSecretComponents`](https://github.com/guardian/play-secret-rotation/blob/main/play/play-v28/RotatingSecretComponents.scala) mix-in trait, it's a case of trying to override everything in `BuiltInComponents` that might be using `CookieSigner` - and _failing_, as https://github.com/guardian/play-secret-rotation/issues/445 recently revealed.\r\n\r\n`play-secret-rotation` works pretty well - and I _think_ with https://github.com/guardian/play-secret-rotation/pull/446 it's now comprehensive - but it's extending Play code in a way that is difficult at this moment in time.\r\n\r\n# Could we add a basic secret-rotation API to Play?\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't have to be a full implementation of key rotation - for instance, Play shouldn't have to support any given data store: the Guardian uses [AWS Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html), but other users would obviously have their data store of choice.\r\n\r\nWhat would be necessary:\r\n\r\n#### Removing/changing the `secret` field in `SecretConfiguration`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/eba67f5ee30c47e89716b447bbd8115b8bb5e25b/core/play/src/main/scala/play/api/http/HttpConfiguration.scala#L79\r\n\r\nThis field, instead of being a single immutable string, would probably now be a trait like this:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase class SecretConfiguration(secretProvider: SecretProvider, provider: Option[String] = None)\r\n\r\ntrait SecretProvider {\r\n  def activeSecret(): String\r\n  def alsoAccepted(): Iterable[String]\r\n}\r\n\r\ncase class StaticSecret(activeSecret: String) extends SecretProvider {\r\n  override val alsoAccepted: Iterable[String] = Nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `StaticSecret` would be the default implementation of `SecretProvider`, and it's what would be used if `play.http.secret.key` was defined - but if it's not defined, it should be possible to specify an alternative implementation depending on the individual users requirements.\r\n\r\nThis would obviously have a lot of knock-on effects in the code, and the classes that `play-secret-rotation` [currently extends](https://github.com/guardian/play-secret-rotation/blob/f1b4704acb294a7fe6408fdd66298ccd8a94290d/play/play-v28/RotatingSecretComponents.scala#L42-L103) (`CookieDataCodec` & `CSRFTokenSigner`) would need to be updated to respect `SecretProvider` and in particular it's `alsoAccepted` field when performing verification. But it would also allow users to hook in whatever implementation of  `SecretProvider` they want, and make plugging in a secret-rotation library much easier.\r\n\r\nI'm very happy to take a shot at implementing this as a PR, if it's something that sounds like it might be accepted?
