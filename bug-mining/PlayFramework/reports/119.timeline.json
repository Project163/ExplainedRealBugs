I'm also not sure why the `filename` parameter value is the `filename*` parameter, but quoted...

issue is visible in Play when we're sending a result. Play creates a header value like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nContent-Disposition: inline; filename=\"测 试.tmp\"; filename*=utf-8''%E6%B5%8B%20%E8%AF%95.tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nAkka HTTP parses this value in Play's `AkkaModelConversion` class, then renders the result as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nContent-Disposition: inline; filename=\"utf-8''%E6%B5%8B%20%E8%AF%95.tmp\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this shows that Akka HTTP has bugs in both parsing and rendering the header.\r\n\r\n* When parsing the header, the `filename*` parameter is preferred over the `filename`, since it comes second in the parameter list. This is correctly handled. However, the `filename*` has a special prefix (`utf8''`) that specifies the character encoding. This prefix should be used by the parser to set the character encoding, but not included in the filename itself. Akka HTTP appears to be including this value in the filename itself, rather than using it to specify a character set when decoding.\r\n\r\n* When rendering the header, the `filename` parameter should probably only include \"safe\" ISO-8859-1, characters. Unsafe characters that need escaping should probably be stripped out, rather than encoded with `%`, like Akka HTTP does. This is because RFC2616 says that `\\` should be used for quoting strings here. To be safe, complex characters could be excluded from the `filename` parameter and encoded properly in the `filename*` parameter instead. Modern clients will recognise and correctly handle the `filename*` parameter, ignoring the `filename` parameter. The `filename*` parameter can include the true filename, encoded and percent-escaped as per RFC6266. The suggested encoding is UTF-8, since it is mandatory for clients to support this encoding.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n* Related Play issue: https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7501\r\n* RFC

#7501.\r\n\r\n1. Improve handling of extended characters in filenames, following the definition in RFC 5987.\r\n\r\n   The previous rendering had a couple of problems. First, it rendered UTF-8 characters into the regular `filename` parameter. Second, its %-escaping of extended characters in the `filename*` parameter used the URI path-segement encoding, which doesn't escape all necessary characters.\r\n\r\n   In addition, the new handling only renders an extended `filename*` parameter when there are special characters that need escaping.\r\n\r\n   See:\r\n   - https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/6042\r\n\r\n2. Use a RawHeader with Akka HTTP to avoid the backend parsing and re-rendering the header. There's currently a bug with this that needs to be fixed before we can use a typed header.\r\n\r\n   See:\r\n   - https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1240\r\n   -

expected behavior of the issue, starting from the first action.\r\n\r\n1. Send a POST request with the header: `Content-Disposition:attachment; filename*=UTF-8''Roget%27s%20Thesaurus.pdf`\r\n2. In your handler, dump the uploaded headers: `System.err.println(requestHeader.headers)`\r\n\r\nYou should see `Content-Disposition` as `attachment; filename*=UTF-8''Roget%27s%20Thesaurus.pdf`\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe `Content-Disposition` header is `attachment; filename=\"UTF-8''Roget%27s%20Thesaurus.pdf\"`\r\n\r\nThe problem: akka-http adds `\"\"` and removes `*`. https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1240 and https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/695 go into why.\r\n\r\nSo there are two problems, really:\r\n\r\n1. The value is wrong -- akka-http converted it in a way that can't be correctly reversed.\r\n2. Netty doesn't do this erroneous conversion, so switching between Netty and akka-http causes an unexpected change in behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7719/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-24T06:11:10Z","updated_at":"2017-11-24T06:11:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-http/issues/1550","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-http","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-http/issues/1550/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-http/issues/1550/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-http/issues/1550/events","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1550","id":276522725,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzY1MjI3MjU=","number":1550,"title":"Add

Play 2.6 we switched from Netty to Akka HTTP as the default HTTP backend. This has led to a number of bugs because of the different way that Akka HTTP handles headers compared to Netty. Netty headers are raw string whereas Akka HTTP uses type-safe objects for many headers. These type safe objects are parsed from the underlying header values according to the their specification.\r\n\r\nType-safe headers are a good idea in principle but it runs into problems when:\r\n\r\n1. Play users need to send/receive non-spec compliant headers (https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7549)\r\n2. Akka HTTP isn't currently spec-compliant (https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/7515, https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7997, https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7501)\r\n3. Akka HTTP is spec compliant, but there is more than one way to be spec compliant and Play users need to send/receive headers in a specific way (https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7737, https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7733, https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/966, https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/7498)\r\n\r\nAkka HTTP does make it possible to use `RawHeader`s. Play uses `RawHeader`s for HTTP responses, but we can't use `RawHeader`s when receiving requests, since the header objects are created internally by Akka HTTP inside the header parsing code.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that we add a new setting to Akka HTTP to give Play (and other users) more control over how HTTP headers are parsed. Here are a few ideas for how a setting could work:\r\n\r\n1. A `Boolean` setting that switches Akka HTTP into \"raw\" mode - all headers are parsed as `RawHeader`s.\r\n2. A `String => Boolean` setting that maps header names to a `Boolean` value, giving more fine-grained control over which headers can be parsed into typed headers and which should be parsed as `RawHeader`s.\r\n3. A `HeaderParser => HeaderParser` (e.g. where `type HeaderParser = (String, String) => Either[ErrorResult, HttpHeader]`) setting that allows the user to override the default `HeaderParser` logic and patch their own logic in. This trivially allows replacing all headers with `ReadHeader`s. Users would also be able to continue to use typed headers and even alter the parsing logic for those headers if they need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-http/issues/1550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-http/issues/1550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/362174953","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7501#issuecomment-362174953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7501","id":362174953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjE3NDk1Mw==","user":{"login":"jayasharma8","id":24290610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjkwNjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24290610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8","html_url":"https://github.com/jayasharma8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayasharma8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-01T06:51:04Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T06:51:04Z","body":"Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nNeed small help. when we try to download any file from the UI, File name is appended to the URL and it's vulnerable.
