trying with the following versions and the error still happens:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava version \"1.8.0_112\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-b16)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM

mode)\r\n```\r\nI think the problem here is that we are moving between thread pools. Since `CacheAction` is not being specific about which thread pool should be used ([`thenComposeAsync` here](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/master/framework/src/play-cache/src/main/java/play/cache/CachedAction.java#L30) uses a default thread pool, which is [`ForkJoinPool.commonPool`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html#commonPool--)).\r\n\r\nBut, if you specify the `Executor`, then you won't need to fallback to `ForkJoinPool` which, as explained in the links you posted, is paranoid about SecurityManagers. The following works:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class MyCachedAction extends Action<MyCached> {\r\n\r\n    private AsyncCacheApi cacheApi;\r\n    private ExecutionContextExecutor executionContext;\r\n\r\n    @Inject\r\n    public MyCachedAction(AsyncCacheApi cacheApi, ExecutionContextExecutor executionContext) {\r\n        this.cacheApi = cacheApi;\r\n        this.executionContext = executionContext;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public CompletionStage<Result> call(Context ctx) {\r\n        final String key = configuration.key();\r\n        final Integer duration = configuration.duration();\r\n        return cacheApi.<Result>get(key).thenComposeAsync(cacheResult -> {\r\n            if (cacheResult != null) {\r\n                return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(cacheResult);\r\n            }\r\n            return delegate.call(ctx).thenComposeAsync(result ->\r\n                    cacheApi.set(key, result, duration).thenApply(ignore -> result)\r\n            );\r\n        }, executionContext);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe only difference is that we are providing a thread pool explicitly.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/315135297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcospereira","id":4576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira","html_url":"https://github.com/marcospereira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1162939060,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE2MjkzOTA2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/1162939060","actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-13T16:45:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1162939061,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExNjI5MzkwNjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/1162939061","actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-13T16:45:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1162939275,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTE2MjkzOTI3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/1162939275","actor":{"login":"marcospereira","id":4576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira","html_url":"https://github.com/marcospereira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"e

See #9594\r\n\r\nHowever, when using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(...)` and `thenxxxAsync` methods you still have to pass an explicit ec, because Java uses the common thread pool for this method by default. There is nothing Play can do about this (it's no an issue with Play actually).\r\n\r\nI suggest closing this issue as soon as #9594 got merged.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/524639556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mkurz","id":644927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDkyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/644927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz","html_url":"https://github.com/mkurz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
