Particularly, when sending a request like:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:9000 \\\r\n-H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' \\\r\n-H 'Authorization: Bearer 123' \\\r\n-H 'X-Custom-Header: 123' -vvv\r\n```\r\nThen `X-Custom-Header` and `Authorization` should be available in the `play.api.mvc.RequestHeader.headers` collection.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nHowever, the actually available headers in the `play.api.mvc.RequestHeader.headers` collection are the following: \r\n`List((Transfer-Encoding,chunked), (Content-Type,none/none), (Content-Encoding,gzip))`. \r\nAs you can see, `X-Custom-Header` and `Authorization` headers are missing.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Test Case\r\n\r\nThe project (a basic Play app) helping to illustrate this issue can be found at\r\nhttps://github.com/RomanIakovlev/play-headers-issue. Just run it in the dev mode via sbt, and execute the specified curl command to see the result.","closed_by":{"login":"gmethvin","id":171663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTY2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin","html_url":"https://github.com/gmethvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7911/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
