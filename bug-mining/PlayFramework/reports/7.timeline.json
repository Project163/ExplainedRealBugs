Note, you should use the `BasicHttpClient` for this test.  Test that it fails before implementing the fix.\n- The fix will go in `NettyResultsStreamer` and `ServerResultUtils`, which will have to treat 304 status code differently - ie, feed the body into a Done iteratee and ignore the result, filter out any `Content-Length` headers already set, and send the response right

described in http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.4,\nboth 204 and 304 responses must not include a message-body. This requirement\nwas not enforced in Play, but the built-in instances for both 204 and 304\nresponses (see `play.api.mvc.Results.NoContent` and\n`play.api.mvc.Results.NotModified`) are constructed with an empty body. Hence,\nthe above mentioned requirement was already respected (though not enforced)\nwhen using these values.\n\nThis commit enforces the requirement, returning an empty body for both 204 and\n304 responses (whether a message body is provided or not).\n\nTicket #3899 requested the `Content-Length` header to never be included in a\n304 result. The specification for 304 (see\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.5) only states\nthat no message body should be returned, but it does not say that a\n`Content-Length` must not be passed.\n\nHence, the solution adopted in this commit is to be lenient with the\n`Content-Length` for both 204 and 304 responses. Meaning that we won't\nautomatically inject a `Content-Length` header for such responses, but we also\nwon't disallow users to provide it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3939/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":236664334,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM2NjY0MzM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/236664334","actor":{"login":"dotta","id":703748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta","html_url":"https://github.com/dotta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"ceae10dae38cab09b628deee73830e967c1f068c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/commits/ceae10dae38cab09b628deee73830e967c1f068c","created_at":"2015-02-17T01:30:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":236664335,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNjY2NDMzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/236664335","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b264a77a36bc2fa88fece0ad0718fb2a1897bf44","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/commits/b264a77a36bc2fa88fece0ad0718fb2a1897bf44","created_at":"2015-02-17T01:30:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":236669930,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDIzNjY2OTkzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/236669930","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-02-17T01:47:54Z","milestone":{"title":"2.4.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/74637110","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3899#issuecomment-74637110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3899","id":74637110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NjM3MTEw","user":{"login":"fgutmann","id":236795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjc5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/236795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgutmann","html_url":"https://github.com/fgutmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgutmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgutmann/following{/other_user}","gists_u

never sends Content-Length header field for a 204 response.\n## Purpose\n\nAs described in [RFC7230 section-3.3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2), sending a Content-Length header field is not allowed in any response with a status code of 1xx (Informational) or 204 (No Content). This requirement was not forced in Play, which means a user can intentionally set a Content-Length header. To follow the RFC section, we need to make sure that we don't send the header field.\n~~With regard to a Content-Length header field in a 304 response, a server May send it as mentioned in RFC7230 section-3.3.2. Thus it'd be better for us to allow users to set the field if they like.~~\nWith regard to a Content-Length header field in a 304 response, we don't allow users to do it currently even a server May send it as mentioned in RFC7230 section-3.3.2.\n\nAdditionally, as described in RFC7230 [section-3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3), 1xx responses don't include a message body. With this commit, a message body isn't sent to meet the requirement.\n## Background Context\n\nAs I've mentioned in Purpose.\n## References\n- Related Issues/PRs\n  - [content-length header included in 304 response which is forbidden by the HTTP spec](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3899)\n  - [Don't include body and Content-Length in 204 and 304 responses. Fixes #3899](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/3939)\n- The following is the partial citation from RFC7230 section-3.3.2 and 3.3.\n\n```\nA server MUST NOT send a Content-Length header field in any response with\na status code of 1xx (Informational) or 204 (No Content). A server MUST NOT send\na Content-Length header field in any 2xx(Successful) response to a CONNECT request\n(Section 4.3.6 of [RFC7231]).\n```\n\n```\nA server MAY send a Content-Length header field in a 304 (Not Modified) response to\na conditional GET request (Section 4.1 of [RFC7232]); a server MUST NOT send\nContent-Length in such a response unless its field-value equals the decimal number of\noctets that would have been sent in the payload body of a 200 (OK) response to\nthe same request.\n```\n\n```\nAll 1xx (Informational), 204 (No Content), and 304 (Not Modified) responses do not\ninclude a message body.

sets `Content-Length` is set to `0` on 304 Not Modified responses. I propose that it is better practice to completely remove the `Content-Length` header from those responses.\r\n\r\nWe can bench-press RFCs (now-superseded [RFC 2616 §10.3.5](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.5), [RFC 7230 §3.3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2), [RFC 7232 §4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232#section-4.1) ); online discussion helps to untangle the abridged nature of those documents and elucidate its practical applications. There seems to be a rough consensus that content length should be omitted, as in [0](https://github.com/heroku/cowboyku/issues/9) [1](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3899). \r\n\r\nThe strongest signal for me comes from 3 places, downstream of the RFCs: Popular web server implementations like Apache HTTPD and NGINX, highly-trafficked web properties like _amagooface_, and intermediate services and equipment implementations like firewalls and caches. My personal experience is they will either omit `Content-Length` (easiest!) or more hazardously fill in the actual number of bytes (\"octets\") modulo a bunch of conditions I don't want to waste precious life-span agitating for.\r\n\r\nAccord to a cursory inspection, high-traffic web properties, whose stable operations depend on getting such fine details right in the real world, uniformly omit `Content-Length`. For example:\r\n```shell\r\ncurl -H 'If-Modified-Since: Tue, 1 Jan 2030 00:00:00 GMT' 'https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_light_color_272x92dp.png'\r\ncurl -H 'If-Modified-Since: Tue, 1 Jan 2030 00:00:00 GMT' 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317875?s=40&v=4'\r\ncurl -H 'If-Modified-Since: Tue, 1 Jan 2030 00:00:00 GMT' 'https://www.redditinc.com/assets/images/site/homepage/reddit-icon.svg'\r\ncurl -H 'If-Modified-Since: Tue, 1 Jan 2030 00:00:00 GMT' 'https://c.s-microsoft.com/static/fonts/segoe-ui/west-european/Semibold/latest.woff2'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in terms of `(wrap-not-modified)`, instead of adding `Content-Length` to the response headers at line 49:\r\nhttps://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/f92911c26e029ef8579066e0d876dbc03b18b550/ring-core/src/ring/middleware/not_modified.clj#L46-L51\r\n\r\nI propose a better course of action is to dissociate `Content-Length` from the headers. I'd submit a PR, but I didn't note any established precedent in the code base for the removal of a header based on its name (HTTP nomenclature) being either a Clojure keyword or a case-insensitive string, so I'm not sure how you'd like it done.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ring-clojure/ring/issues/509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ring-clojure/ring/issues/509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
