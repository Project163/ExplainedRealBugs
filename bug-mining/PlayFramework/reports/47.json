This is required when using \"streaming\" style services - eg. Twitter Streaming APIs - which never complete.\n\nExample code borrowed from [Reactive Web Applications](http://www.manning.com/bernhardt/):\n\n``` scala\n      WS.url(\"https://stream.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/filter.json\")\n        .withRequestTimeout(-1)\n        .sign(OAuthCalculator(consumerKey, requestToken))\n        .withQueryString(\"track\" -> \"mondaymotivation\")\n        .get { response =>\n          Logger.info(\"Status: \" + response.status)\n          iteratee\n        }.map { _ =>\n          Ok(\"Stream closed\")\n        }\n```\n\nThe reason it's not possible is some extra validation has been put into [NingWS.scala](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/2.4.x/framework/src/play-ws/src/main/scala/play/api/libs/ws/ning/NingWS.scala#L116) to check that the request timeout is a positive integer. Not setting a request timeout just uses the default (120 seconds).\n\nLooking at the underlying AHC a request timeout of -1 is treated as a special case:\nhttps://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/blob/master/providers/netty3/src/main/java/org/asynchttpclient/netty/request/NettyRequestSender.java#L380\n\nI can submit PR for code fix, tests and documentation changes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcospereira","id":4576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira","html_url":"https://github.com/marcospereira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
