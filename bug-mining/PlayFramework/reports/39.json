Is there a particular reason for this?\n\nThe problem I'm currently facing is that initialization of `routes` in a DI container can cause loading of application-specific classes, like controllers (I noticed it when I switched to `routesGenerator := InjectedRoutesGenerator`). I debugged it a little bit, and only in this particular place the context class loader is `PlayDependencyClassLoader` instead of `ReloadableClassLoader`.\n\nThis causes all kinds of errors, including `ClassNotFoundException`:\n\n```\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: controllers.Application\n```\n\nI checked other places, like `applicationLoader.load(...)`, and they all are executed with current application's classloader being a context class loader of the current thread.\n","closed_by":{"login":"gmethvin","id":171663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTY2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin","html_url":"https://github.com/gmethvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
