things\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nFixes #13013 \r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nDo not try to delete the temporary folder during shutdown if it was never created in the 1st place. Because when trying to delete, it actually tries to create the folder if it was not already created. This is useless and can cause errors with read-only filesystems.\r\n\r\n## Background Context\r\n\r\nI used a simple mutable `var` as I believe this is enough in this context: the `var` is private, in a singleton, only set during a `lazy val` initialization.\r\nHowever, if you believe we should use an `AtomicBoolean`, just say it :)\r\n\r\nNote that I didn't add test, not sure if this is worth it and I'm not sure how to approach writing such a test.\r\n\r\n##

Fixes\n\nFixes #13013 \n\n## Purpose\n\nDo not try to delete the temporary folder during shutdown if it was never created in the 1st place. Because when trying to delete, it actually tries to create the folder if it was not already created. This is useless and can cause errors with read-only filesystems.\n\n## Background Context\n\nI used a simple mutable `var` as I believe this is enough in this context: the `var` is private, in a singleton, only set during a `lazy val` initialization.\nHowever, if you believe we should use an `AtomicBoolean`, just say it :)\n\nNote that I didn't add test, not sure if this is worth it and I'm not sure how to approach writing such a test.\n\n## References\n\nN/A\n<hr>This is an automatic backport of pull request #13039 done by

Fixes\n\nFixes #13013 \n\n## Purpose\n\nDo not try to delete the temporary folder during shutdown if it was never created in the 1st place. Because when trying to delete, it actually tries to create the folder if it was not already created. This is useless and can cause errors with read-only filesystems.\n\n## Background Context\n\nI used a simple mutable `var` as I believe this is enough in this context: the `var` is private, in a singleton, only set during a `lazy val` initialization.\nHowever, if you believe we should use an `AtomicBoolean`, just say it :)\n\nNote that I didn't add test, not sure if this is worth it and I'm not sure how to approach writing such a test.\n\n## References\n\nN/A\n<hr>This is an automatic backport of pull request #13039 done by [Mergify](https://mergify.com).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/13116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/13116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
