#4691\n\nThe general approach:\n- Promise now extends `CompletionStage`.  All `CompletionStage` methods that return `CompletionStage` have been overridden to return `Promise`, and `flatMap` and similar methods have been modified to accept a function that is covariant on the returned `CompletionStage`, so functions that return `Promise` can be used as is.  These changes should allow most uses of `Promise` to be source compatible with `CompletionStage`.\n- Most Play APIs that accept a `Promise` from the user now accept `CompletionStage`, this should be a source compatible change.\n- Most Play APIs that return or pass a `Promise` to the user still return/pass `Promise`, this should allow users to switch to using `CompletionStage` and still use these APIs.\n- All `Promise` methods have been deprecated, including `map`, `flatMap`, `recover` etc, pointing users to the new `CompletionStage` equivalents.\n- Since `Promise` used `ExecutionContext`, which supports thread local propagation, but `CompletionStage` uses `Executor`, which doesn't support thread local propagation, a new API has been introduced called `HttpExecutionContext`, which allows getting the current `Executor` at the call site of `CompletionStage` operations, to capture the thread local context, and propagate it to the callbacks.\n- The documentation has been updated to talk about `CompletionStage` rather than `Promise`.  The general approach in the documentation is to refer to `CompletionStage` as a \"promise\", since it's much easier to refer to them with a simple name like promise, and also terminology such as map is used, however when referring to the specific types and methods, then `CompletionStage`, `thenApply`, `thenCompose` etc are used.\n- The biggest breaking change is in `Action`, which since it uses the decorator pattern, can't be modified in a source compatible way since the invocation of the decorated action will return `CompletionStage` not `Promise` to the user, however if left as is, would prevent the user from returning `CompletionStage` and force them to use the `Promise` API.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5137/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":427942624,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyNzk0MjYyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/427942624","actor":{"login":"dotta","id":703748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta","html_url":"https://github.com/dotta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"acd5e0c275589de7837eeb1b487a29fca50f3c18","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotta/playframework/commits/acd5e0c275589de7837eeb1b487a29fca50f3c18","created_at":"2015-10-06T13:28:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":427943705,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQyNzk0MzcwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/427943705","actor":{"login":"dotta","id":703748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta","html_url":"https://github.com/dotta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-06T13:29:15Z","milestone":{"title":"2.5.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":428179135,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI4MTc5MTM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/428179135","actor":{"login":"dotta","id":703748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta","html_url":"https://github.com/dotta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"acd5e0c275589de7837eeb1b487a29fca50f3c18","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/commits/acd5e0c275589de7837eeb1b487a29fca50f3c18","created_at":"2015-10-06T16:40:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":428179137,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyODE3OTEzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/428179137","actor":{"login":"benmccann","id":322311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/322311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/benmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmc
