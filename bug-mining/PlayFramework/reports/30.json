Play 2.3 you could write a template like [the example from the i18n docs](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/JavaI18N#Use-in-templates):\n\n```\n@import play.i18n._\n@Messages.get(\"key\")\n```\n\nIn Play 2.4 this will fail:\n\n```\n[error] mytemplate.template.scala:29: reference to Messages is ambiguous;\n[error] it is imported twice in the same scope by\n[error] import play.i18n._\n[error] and import play.api.i18n._\n```\n\nInstead you need to write the import explicitly:\n\n```\n@import play.i18n.Messages\n@Messages.get(\"key\")\n```\n\nThe error probably happens because the placement of the import statement changed in Play 2.4.\n\nI think we should fix this unless there was some other reason for the import statements to be moved. If we don't fix it then a lot of templates are going to stop compiling in Play 2.4.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
