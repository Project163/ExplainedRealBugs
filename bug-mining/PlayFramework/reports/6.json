The `eclipse` command triggers a project's compilation, as both the templates and routes files need to be compiled prior to import the project (otherwise build errors may be reported once the project is opened in Eclipse).\nHowever, if a Play project cannot be compiled, it should still be possible to import the project in Eclipse. As explained in the [Play documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/IDE), this can be achieved by adding the following setting in the `build.sbt`:\n\n`EclipsePlugin.EclipseKeys.preTasks := Seq()`\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't work for a Play Java project.\n\nThe reason why it doesn't work is the definition of `addScalaLib` in [PlayEclipse.scala](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/eb2267cd2fa58e6a510a0b086e9c395ef4f69fd6/framework/src/sbt-plugin/src/main/scala/PlayEclipse.scala#L56), in particular the following expression `dependencyClasspath in Runtime`, which forces compilation of the project.\n\nTo get around the problem, add the following settings in the `build.sbt`:\n\n```\nEclipseKeys.classpathTransformerFactories := EclipseKeys.classpathTransformerFactories.value.init\nEclipsePlugin.EclipseKeys.preTasks := Seq()\n```\n\nThe fix should be as simple as changing `dependencyClasspath in Runtime` to `dependencyClasspath in Compile` [here](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/eb2267cd2fa58e6a510a0b086e9c395ef4f69fd6/framework/src/sbt-plugin/src/main/scala/PlayEclipse.scala#L58).\n\nHowever, I really can't see why we need the `addScalaLib` transformer for a Play Java project (see [here](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/eb2267cd2fa58e6a510a0b086e9c395ef4f69fd6/framework/src/sbt-plugin/src/main/scala/PlayEclipse.scala#L111)). Could it be that sbteclipse used to remove the scala library from the Eclipse classpath entries for a plain Java project? cc-ing @jsuereth @hseeberger who may help clarifying this point.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dotta","id":703748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta","html_url":"https://github.com/dotta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
