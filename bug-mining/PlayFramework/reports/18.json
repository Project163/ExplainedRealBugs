Rather, one has to stop, compile, and run again manually to get the changes to take effect. As an additional pain point, this unnecessarily kills sessions. It can take a pretty big toll on productivity.\n\nIf it matters, I'm also running Activator in a Docker container.\n\nIs there a solution for this that I'm missing?\n","closed_by":{"login":"johnhoffman","id":6497699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTc2OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6497699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman","html_url":"https://github.com/johnhoffman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhoffman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
