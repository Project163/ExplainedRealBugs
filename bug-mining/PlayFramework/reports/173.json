However, it can inadvertently crop a prefix of the body if initial decoding failures do not occur at the very front of the input.\r\n\r\nHere is the offending code in question. Note how the `byteBuffer` does not get set back to an initial position before re-retrying.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/cc7208b5fd53712c00011a718b095ed9479a2c44/core/play/src/main/scala/play/api/mvc/BodyParsers.scala#L463-L504\r\n\r\nI ran across this trying to decode with `tolerantText` the UTF-8 encoded string `\"Oekraïene\"`. US-ASCII manages the first 5 characters before failing. Then, the UTF-8 decoder tries, but only produces `\"ïene\"` (since the bytes corresponding to `\"Oekra\"` have already been passed in the byte buffer).\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple: remember to `rewind()` the buffer before re-trying to parse. Preparing a PR + regression test now.","closed_by":{"login":"mergify[bot]","id":37929162,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzc5MjkxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/10562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/mergify","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mergify%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/10181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/10181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
