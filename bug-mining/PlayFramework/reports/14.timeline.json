We could remove the mappings to include them, but I think some people depend on them being there and then they manually configure Play to point to them.  The option is to include that conf directory on the classpath (and ensure it's first on the classpath), which is probably not a bad idea, but it does change existing behaviour.\n\nYou can put it on the classpath in your build by doing something along the lines of this in `build.sbt`:\n\n``` scala\nimport NativePackagerKeys._\n\nscriptClasspath := \"../conf\" :+ scriptClasspath.value\n```\n\nOne problem with the above, I'm not sure if it will work on Windows - the generated batch script will probably end up with the forward slash, not sure how the JDK on Windows copes with that.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/57750108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"cb372","id":106760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjc2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372","html_url":"https://github.com/cb372","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cb372/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-16T09:18:32Z","updated_at":"2014-10-16T09:18:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/m3dev/octoparts/issues/53","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/m3dev/octoparts","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/m3dev/octoparts/issues/53/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/m3dev/octoparts/issues/53/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/m3dev/octoparts/issues/53/events","html_url":"https://github.com/m3dev/octoparts/pull/53","id":45964555,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjI4NDE3MDA=","number":53,"title":"Add

seem the be the cause of it.\n- In #2084 it is actually called _expected behaviour_.\n- I found some [StackOverflow

author of this issue.\n- ... there are likely more related issues which I haven't found yet\n\nThat is what I found after a quick search. The point I'm trying to make here is:\nWhat might be _expected behaviour_ by the team doesn't seem to be expected by the users.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the `dist` `app/conf` folder, if it is not loaded anyway?\nSomewhere I read that you can refer to it by `-Dfile.config` and those files there are meant as _templates_. In this case I would vote for calling the directory `template` instead.\n\nI would appreciate if we could somehow change the status quo and would propose to either remove the content or rename / move it somewhere where the purpose gets clearer.\nWhat makes this worse is that the `conf` folder in `Dev` mode is actually the place to configure the application - so the developer are actually used to expect the contents of it to be configuration (not templates).\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/61612670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tloist","id":8626748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjY3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8626748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist","html_url":"https://github.com/tloist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tloist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/77037971","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3473#issuecomment-77037971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3473","id":77037971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDM3OTcx","user":{"login":"chenbekor","id":1867481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njc0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1867481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor","html_url":"https://github.com/chenbekor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenbekor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-03T21:25:28Z","updated_at":"2015-03-03T21:25:28Z","body":"could not agree more with the troubles we had with this in prod. we find it very useful to change things like logger,  connection strings etc even if in production. otherwise what's the point of including the conf dir? please make conf folder operational so that we could alter it's content and restart to see the effect. this refers to both  regular conf files and logback configuration files!

The first is that it's a resources directory that goes on your classpath like `src/main/resources` would in a typical project. The second is that some people want a place to put external configuration files that are included in a directory packaged with the app when you run `dist`. Right now the `conf` directory gets both included into your jar and then included again a second time in the dist zip. Having it in two places as we do now is a recipe for confusion. I know folks on my team have been caught off guard by this in the past and I needed to explain to them how it worked because it was causing trouble for them.\n\nI personally think the best solution here would be to stop using this directory for two different things. I would create a new directory called `resources` that has the resources you want to be on your classpath and use `conf` just for the external configuration. This would have to be mentioned in the migration guide to make sure folks move files from `conf` to `resources` as needed.\n\nIf we split the current `conf` directory into two like this, then there's the question of where do you want `application.conf` to be located? You can put it in either place and it will work just fine. You just need to set the command line flag accordingly to load it either as a resource or a file. I believe more people would probably want it located
