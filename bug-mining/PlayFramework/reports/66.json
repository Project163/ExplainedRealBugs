We don't need to deprecate because I think the field is new in Play 2.5. Even if it's not a new field, it's OK to rename it because the streams module was tagged experimental in Play 2.4.\n","closed_by":{"login":"wsargent","id":71236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent","html_url":"https://github.com/wsargent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsargent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
