issue is visible in Play when we're sending a result. Play creates a header value like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nContent-Disposition: inline; filename=\"测 试.tmp\"; filename*=utf-8''%E6%B5%8B%20%E8%AF%95.tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nAkka HTTP parses this value in Play's `AkkaModelConversion` class, then renders the result as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nContent-Disposition: inline; filename=\"utf-8''%E6%B5%8B%20%E8%AF%95.tmp\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this shows that Akka HTTP has bugs in both parsing and rendering the header.\r\n\r\n* When parsing the header, the `filename*` parameter is preferred over the `filename`, since it comes second in the parameter list. This is correctly handled. However, the `filename*` has a special prefix (`utf8''`) that specifies the character encoding. This prefix should be used by the parser to set the character encoding, but not included in the filename itself. Akka HTTP appears to be including this value in the filename itself, rather than using it to specify a character set when decoding.\r\n\r\n* When rendering the header, the `filename` parameter should probably only include \"safe\" ISO-8859-1, characters. Unsafe characters that need escaping should probably be stripped out, rather than encoded with `%`, like Akka HTTP does. This is because RFC2616 says that `\\` should be used for quoting strings here. To be safe, complex characters could be excluded from the `filename` parameter and encoded properly in the `filename*` parameter instead. Modern clients will recognise and correctly handle the `filename*` parameter, ignoring the `filename` parameter. The `filename*` parameter can include the true filename, encoded and percent-escaped as per RFC6266. The suggested encoding is UTF-8, since it is mandatory for clients to support this encoding.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n* Related Play issue: https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7501\r\n* RFC

Play 2.6 we switched from Netty to Akka HTTP as the default HTTP backend. This has led to a number of bugs because of the different way that Akka HTTP handles headers compared to Netty. Netty headers are raw string whereas Akka HTTP uses type-safe objects for many headers. These type safe objects are parsed from the underlying header values according to the their specification.\r\n\r\nType-safe headers are a good idea in principle but it runs into problems when:\r\n\r\n1. Play users need to send/receive non-spec compliant headers (https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7549)\r\n2. Akka HTTP isn't currently spec-compliant (https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/7515, https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7997, https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7501)\r\n3. Akka HTTP is spec compliant, but there is more than one way to be spec compliant and Play users need to send/receive headers in a specific way (https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7737, https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7733, https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/966, https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/7498)\r\n\r\nAkka HTTP does make it possible to use `RawHeader`s. Play uses `RawHeader`s for HTTP responses, but we can't use `RawHeader`s when receiving requests, since the header objects are created internally by Akka HTTP inside the header parsing code.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that we add a new setting to Akka HTTP to give Play (and other users) more control over how HTTP headers are parsed. Here are a few ideas for how a setting could work:\r\n\r\n1. A `Boolean` setting that switches Akka HTTP into \"raw\" mode - all headers are parsed as `RawHeader`s.\r\n2. A `String => Boolean` setting that maps header names to a `Boolean` value, giving more fine-grained control over which headers can be parsed into typed headers and which should be parsed as `RawHeader`s.\r\n3. A `HeaderParser => HeaderParser` (e.g. where `type HeaderParser = (String, String) => Either[ErrorResult, HttpHeader]`) setting that allows the user to override the default `HeaderParser` logic and patch their own logic in. This trivially allows replacing all headers with `ReadHeader`s. Users would also be able to continue to use typed headers and even alter the parsing logic for those headers if they need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-http/issues/1550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-http/issues/1550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/346750584","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/7733#issuecomment-346750584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7733","id":346750584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Njc1MDU4NA==","user":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-24T06:13:54Z","updated_at":"2017-11-24T06:13:54Z","body":"Added

That Akka HTTP won't log warnings, won't reject headers and won't reformat headers.\r\n\r\nSeveral headers are still parsed in order for Akka HTTP to function properly: Content-Type, Content-Encoding,
