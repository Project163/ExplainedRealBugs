@fommil and @emilypi for reporting this. I've reproduced the issue with caching on the Netty backend.\r\n\r\nI think this is an issue with the fact that the caching code uses reference equality to check if the application (wrapped in a `Try`) has changed. The reference equality check is good for efficiency, but we've made a mistake in the Netty backend and we're accidentally rewrapping the application in a new `Success` object partway through the request flow. This breaks the caching and results in the configuration being reloaded on every request (or even more than once per request). The Akka HTTP backend is not affected because it always accesses the cache with the same object.\r\n\r\nI think the fix will be pretty easy. We can refactor the Netty flow so it preserves the same `Try[Application]` through the request handling. This can be done by changing the `handleAction` method so it accepts a `Try[Application]` parameter instead of an `Option[Application]`. This allows us to  avoid converting from `Try` to `Option` and back to `Try` again, so we keep the same object.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/2.6.12/framework/src/play-netty-server/src/main/scala/play/core/server/netty/PlayRequestHandler.scala#L269-L274\r\n\r\nThe harder part will be to write a test for this so it doesn't happen again. Perhaps we can mock out the configuration loading code in a test so that every configuration load triggers a counter. That way we can test how many reloads happen when requests occur.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/376795345/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1544953056,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU0NDk1MzA1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/1544953056","actor":{"login":"fommil","id":1914041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTQwNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1914041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil","html_url":"https://github.com/fommil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-28T07:54:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1544953057,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NDQ5NTMwNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/1544953057","actor":{"login":"fommil","id":1914041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTQwNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1914041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil","html_url":"https://github.com/fommil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fommil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-28T07:54:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1544953058,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU0NDk1MzA1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/1544953058","actor":{"login":"emilypi","id":10459342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU5MzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10459342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi","html_url":"https://github.com/emilypi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilypi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-28T07:54:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1544953060,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NDQ5NTMwNjA=","url":"https://api.gith
