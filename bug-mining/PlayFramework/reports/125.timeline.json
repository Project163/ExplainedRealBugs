problem seems to be that Akka HTTP sends different info for HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 requests.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is a working HTTP/1.1 request:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequest = {HttpRequest@22648,…,HttpProtocol(HTTP/1.1))\"\r\n method = {HttpMethod@20503} \"HttpMethod(GET)\"\r\n uri = {Uri$$anon$1@22655} \"http://localhost:9000/test?param=s\"\r\n headers = {$colon$colon@22656} \"::\" size = 11\r\n  …\r\n  1 = {Raw$minusRequest$minusURI@22664} \"Raw-Request-URI: /test?param=s\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is a failing HTTP/2 request:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequest = {HttpRequest@22599} \"HttpRequest(…,HttpProtocol(HTTP/2.0))\"\r\n method = {HttpMethod@20503} \"HttpMethod(GET)\"\r\n uri = {Uri$$anon$1@22603} \"https://localhost:9443/test%3Fparam=s\"\r\n headers = {Vector@22604} \"Vector\" size = 9\r\n  <<<no Raw-Request-URI header in Vector>>>\r\n…\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two differences I can see:\r\n1. The `HttpRequest`'s `uri` field is different for both. For the HTTP/1 request the query parameter is properly separated by a `?`. For the HTTP/2 request the query parameter is shown as part of the path.\r\n2. The `HttpRequest` includes a `Raw-Request-URI` header in the HTTP/1.1 request, but not in the HTTP/2 request. This affects the conversion logic:

raise bug upstream in Akka HTTP and possibly implement fix\r\n2. if Play actually requires the `Raw-Request-URI` field to be present then it should _require_ it to be present and give an error if it is missing, instead of just falling back to the `HttpRequest` `uri` field.\r\n2. add unit tests to Play for path parsing when using

is the first PR for getting HTTP/2 integration tests going. At the moment integration tests are split into Netty and Akka HTTP tests. This PR lays the groundwork for a new \"axis\" of testing. There will now be tests for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the integration tests support a parameterised `ServerProvider`, which allows us to pick the right server to start; either Netty or Akka HTTP. This PR introduces a `ServerEndpoint` concept which describes how to connect to a server. At the moment it only has scheme and port information; in the next PR it will also contain information about which protocol the endpoint supports, i.e. HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nBy writing our tests in terms of a `ServerEndpoint` we can make our tests respond to different types of connections - HTTP, HTTPS and in the future HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nFor now, I have added a specialised HTTP/2 test, `Http2Spec`, which proves the idea of using different HTTP and HTTPS endpoints. Right now the `Http2Spec` itself manages the details of setting up HTTP/2, so `Http2Spec` is currently the only HTTP/2 test.\r\n\r\nIn the next PR I'll move the details of starting servers in HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 mode down to the `ServerIntegrationSpecification` trait. That will allow us to push HTTP/2 through all of our integration tests.\r\n\r\nI'll need to think about whether to introduce an `AkkaHttp2ServerSpecification` subtype to follow the style of the existing `NettyServerSpecification` and `AkkaHttpServerSpecification`, or whether to eliminate these subtypes altogether and just let the `ServerIntegrationSpecification` manage the details of running all the different test variants itself.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I have added a `ServerIntegrationWsTestClient` trait which mirrors the API of the `WsTestClient` trait, except it is `ServerEndpoint` aware, so it'll be able to handle different types of connections more easily.\r\n\r\nI've also added a `ServerIntegrationOkHttpClient` trait with a similar interface, but which uses OkHttp instead of an `AhcWSClient`. I'm using OkHttp because it supports HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nFinally, I've refactored the `TestServer` code a bit so that we support dynamic, rather than fixed, ports. This will allow us to run tests in parallel, since it means that ports won't clash. It seemed like a good idea to do this since `ServerEndpoint`s provide an easy way to pass dynamic port information down to running tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/7710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1230299807,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDEyMzAyOTk4MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/1230299807","actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-31T20:26:22Z","milestone":{"title":"Play
