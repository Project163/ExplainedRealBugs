currently trying to move our Play 2.3 project to 2.4, using Scaldi for DI whereever possible. To get a little more in touch with it, I've tried to create a minimal basis, expanding it once it works.\nI started with the basic play-scala template from the activator and added dependencies and structures according to the [scaldi-play-example](https://github.com/scaldi/scaldi-play-example), since the example itself did not work (not sure why, the error message was ... curious). Everything compiled fine, however, when I started the server and moved to the index page....\n\n```\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Type controllers.Assets does not have no-argument constructor or constructor with single implicit `Injector` argument.\n scaldi.play.ControllerInjector$$anonfun$5.apply(ControllerInjector.scala:70)\n scaldi.play.ControllerInjector$$anonfun$5.apply(ControllerInjector.scala:70)\n scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:121)\nscaldi.play.ControllerInjector.scaldi$play$ControllerInjector$$createBinding(ControllerInjector.scala:70)\n scaldi.play.ControllerInjector$$anonfun$getBindingInternal$2$$anonfun$apply$2.apply(ControllerInjector.scala:33)\n scaldi.play.ControllerInjector$$anonfun$getBindingInternal$2$$anonfun$apply$2.apply(ControllerInjector.scala:32) [...]\n```\n\nThe default route to this controller looks like this:\n\n```\nGET     /assets/*file               controllers.Assets.versioned(path=\"/public\", file: Asset)\n```\n\nI've also tried the version with a leading @:\n\n```\nGET     /assets/*file               @controllers.Assets.versioned(path=\"/public\", file: Asset)\n```\n\nBut that lead to the same error, with an even longer stacktrace.\n\nI've had a look at how this controller is defined, and surprisingly found to different definitions in play.api.controller.Assets.\n\n```\nobject Assets extends AssetsBuilder(LazyHttpErrorHandler) [L 234]\n\n@Singleton\nclass Assets @Inject() (errorHandler: HttpErrorHandler) extends AssetsBuilder(errorHandler) [L 342]\n```\n\nIt seems like the ControllerInjector gets confused about this - or is there something I did not recognize yet?\n\nMight this be related to the more general Assets problem, like mentioned [here](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/4576) ? I know it's about sub-projects, but there seems to be a more general issue with the assets route.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scaldi/scaldi-play/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scaldi/scaldi-play/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/111916564","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/4616#issuecomment-111916564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4616","id":111916564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTkxNjU2NA==","user":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-15T04:14:37Z","updated_at":"2015-06-15T04:14:37Z","body":"Are
