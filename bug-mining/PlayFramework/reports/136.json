See the `catch (Throwable e) {}` below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n} catch (Throwable t) {\r\n  if (tx != null) {\r\n    try { tx.rollback(); } catch (Throwable e) {}\r\n  }\r\n  throw t;\r\n} ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. We should try and avoid catching `Throwable` - maybe catch `NonFatal` instead?\r\n2. Since we've got two exceptions at this point but we can only throw one, we should update `catch (Throwable e) {}` to log the value of `e` before we `throw t`.","closed_by":{"login":"marcospereira","id":4576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira","html_url":"https://github.com/marcospereira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospereira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8023/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8023/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
