But the json iteratee is a parser combinator style iteratee, where there's a lot of recursive flatMapping, after each token, field name, value, etc, there's always an

is closely related to the Future.flatMap problem (which was a memory leak not a stack overflow). The Future.flatMap problem had onComplete chains linking the Future objects together. This could grow in an unbounded way. We could eliminate the leak by flattening the chains.\n\nThere's unbounded function composition happening in Iteratee.flatMap. This could eventually cause a memory leak because of the huge chain of closures all pointing back to each other. It can definitely cause stack overflows when called, as you've seen.\n\nIt's easier to see if we rewrite the closure inside flatMap as a named function.\n\n``` scala\ndef fm(k, f, ec) = i => k(i).flatMap(f)(ec)\n```\n\nOnce we've done this we can see the effect of repeated flatMap calls.\n\n``` scala\nc1 = Cont(k1)\n\nc2 = c1.flatMap(f2)(ec2)\nc2 = Cont(k1).flatMap(f2)(ec2)\nc2 = Cont(fm(k1, f2, ec2))\nc2 = Cont(k2) where k2 = fm(k1, f2, ec2)\n\nc3 = c2.flatMap(f3)(ec3)\nc3 = Cont(k2).flatMap(f3)(ec3)\nc3 = Cont(fm(k2, f3, ec3))\nc3 = Cont(fm(fm(k1, f2, ec2), f3, ec3))\nc3 = Cont(k3) where k3 = fm(fm(k1, f2, ec2), f3, ec3)\n\nc4 = c3.flatMap(f4, ec4)\n... snip ...\nc4 = Cont(k4) where k4 = fm(fm(fm(k1, f2, ec2), f3, ec3), f4, ec4)\n\nc5 = c4.flatMap(f5, ec5)\n... snip ...\nc5 = Cont(k5) where k5 = fm(fm(fm(fm(k1, f2, ec2), f3, ec3), f4, ec4), f5, ec5)\n```\n\nAt least that's the theory. :) I'll try to write a unit test now to see if I can get the error. Then I'll look at a solution. I don't think we can use the same solution as we used for Futures because in this case we don't have an internal structure of completion handlers we can work with. I'm certain we can get something to eliminate the recursion (e.g. a trampoline), but I'm not sure about how to avoid collecting all the parameters (k1, f2, ec2, f3, ec3, f4, ec4, f5, ec5, …) at each step. Maybe we can't avoid that.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/71939391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":226517153,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNjUxNzE1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/226517153","actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f64f0994aa95be5b555f57aa6686c34d9b267b7c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richdougherty/playframework/commits/f64f0994aa95be5b555f57aa6686c34d9b267b7c","created_at":"2015-01-29T00:59:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-29T00:59:55Z","updated_at":"2015-01-29T00:59:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3863","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3863/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3863/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3863/events","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/3863","id":55840594,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjgyNDUwODM=","number":3863,"title":"Use
