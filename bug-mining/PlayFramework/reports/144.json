is a bug that prevents users from being able to make dependency-injected `ConnectionPool` objects.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nIn normal usage Play binds its `Injector` type to a `GuiceInjector`. The `GuiceInjector` object can be used to instantiate classes via Guice dependency injection.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/37b98096cfeca88b671eb94e86c00d6542ce8466/framework/src/play-guice/src/main/scala/play/api/inject/guice/GuiceInjectorBuilder.scala#L159-L164\r\n\r\nThis `Injector` is passed to the `DBApiProvider`'s constructor.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/37b98096cfeca88b671eb94e86c00d6542ce8466/framework/src/play-jdbc/src/main/scala/play/api/db/DBModule.scala#L55-L71\r\n(Guice will provide a value for `injector` so the `NewInstanceInjector` won't be used)\r\n\r\nHowever when the `DBApiProvider` creates a `DefaultDBApi`, it fails to pass in the `GuiceInjector`\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/37b98096cfeca88b671eb94e86c00d6542ce8466/framework/src/play-jdbc/src/main/scala/play/api/db/DBModule.scala#L84-L87\r\ninstead relying on the default value of `injector` in the `DefaultDBApi` constructor, a `NewInstanceInjector`:\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/37b98096cfeca88b671eb94e86c00d6542ce8466/framework/src/play-jdbc/src/main/scala/play/api/db/DefaultDBApi.scala#L14-L18\r\n\r\nA `NewInstanceInjector` is OK in some circumstances, but it isn't able to handle classes that require dependency injection.\r\n\r\nWhen `DefaultDBApi.get` is called later on it passes the `NewInstanceInjector` to `ConnectionPool.fromConfig`:\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/37b98096cfeca88b671eb94e86c00d6542ce8466/framework/src/play-jdbc/src/main/scala/play/api/db/DefaultDBApi.scala#L22-L28\r\n\r\nIf the `ConnectionPool.fromConfig` method encounters a custom `ConnectionPool` it will try to use the `NewInstanceInjector` to create the `ConnectionPool`.\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/37b98096cfeca88b671eb94e86c00d6542ce8466/framework/src/play-jdbc/src/main/scala/play/api/db/ConnectionPool.scala#L42-L48\r\n\r\nIf the custom `ConnectionPool`'s constructor has arguments and is expecting to be created by Guice then injection with the `NewInstanceInjector` will fail with an error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodException: com.example.MyCustomConnectionPool.<init>()\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
