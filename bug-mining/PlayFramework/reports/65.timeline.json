you mind giving headers for a working and non-working requests? I can reproduce if I set headers to:\n\n```\nX-Forwarded-For: ::1\n```\n\nI think the reason is that we are now actually parsing the `X-Forwarded-For` header value. Maybe we need to make the parsing lazy, so we only actually parse if we need to check that an address is a trusted proxy. The reason the parsing is failing is that we are expecting IPv6 addresses to follow the format in RFC7239, i.e. `[::1]` not `::1`.\n\nYou may be able to fix this by changing your settings to:\n\n```\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;\n```\n\nThis will tell Play that you forwarded the connection for the given `$remote_addr` and Play will use that value as the request's `remoteAddress` property. It will also remove the troublesome `::1` entry from the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

From the exception message I assume both of these requests come via a proxy on 127.0.0.1 connecting via HTTP. I also assume you're using [default settings for trusted proxies](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/HTTPServer#Configure-trusted-proxies), not doing anything special.\n\nI think the reason it works for one request, but fails for another, is that the failing request will be trying to read the request's `remoteAddress` or `secure` flag, whereas the working request won't be accessing these values. The header parsing is lazy so it should only occur when `remoteAddress` or `secure` is accessed. Can you look at the stack trace and check that the code accessing `remoteAddress` and `secure` is your application code and not something that Play is doing automatically. If you can verify this then that will explain why one request is working and the other request is failing. If you're not sure, maybe you can paste more of the stack trace here.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/159403734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/159526008","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/5299#issuecomment-159526008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5299","id":159526008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTUyNjAwOA==","user":{"login":"DorianGrey","id":1473055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzMwNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1473055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey","html_url":"https://github.com/DorianGrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-25T07:40:17Z","updated_at":"2015-11-25T07:40:17Z","body":"> I assume both of these requests come via a proxy on 127.0.0.1 connecting via HTTP.

For development, this setup would not be required, but it's useful to mirror the production environment's behavior to detect things like this issue before they even get a chance to cause problems there.\n\n> Can you look at the stack trace [...]\n\nI fear that what I've posted already _is_ the whole stacktrace that occurs in the logs.\n\n> [...] and check that the code accessing `remoteAddress` and `secure` is your application code and not something that Play is doing automatically [...]\n\nIt seems that our code causes this -  `request.remoteAddress` get accessed on the login hook, but not on the hook that deals with the XHRs. This access is not that relevant and might be removed (and the login works if I do so, of course). However, we've got other hooks accessing the remote address field for performing some checks on it, and I must not change these.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/159526008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DorianGrey","id":1473055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzMwNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1473055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey","html_url":"https://github.com/DorianGrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianGrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/159724156","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/5299#issuecomment-159724156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5299","id":159724156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTcyNDE1Ng==","user":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-25T20:30:53Z","updated_at":"2015-11-25T20:30:53Z","body":"Thanks
