yeah the chunker was mainly to keep the surface api the same. play can configure a `bufferSize` for gzip. thus to satisfy the api I added the chunker.\r\n\r\nMaybe that's not needed and we can just use `bufferSize = 0` for that. Another possibility would be to keep the interface but ignore the parameter for now.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/672755044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jrudolph","id":9868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph","html_url":"https://github.com/jrudolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/672757239","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/10418#issuecomment-672757239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/10418","id":672757239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Mjc1NzIzOQ==","user":{"login":"jrudolph","id":9868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph","html_url":"https://github.com/jrudolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-12T09:15:42Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T09:15:42Z","body":"@FranklinYinanDing \r\n\r\n> @jrudolph Maybe I understand it wrong, or something isn't right - [this line](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/6813/files#diff-dc46281aa6759e9b0b71d023b83fc87aR66) uses `splitAt`, when the buffer is smaller than the `chunkSize` (say 3 vs 8192), it will still produce the entire buffer (3) and push. So if the Http.Chunked is a sequence of small chunks, Gzip is still compressing small chunks.\r\n\r\nI think that's correct, however, `emitChunk` is only called unconditionally from `onPush`.
