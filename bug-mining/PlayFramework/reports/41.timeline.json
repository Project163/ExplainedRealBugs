When `addCache` fails, it means that there are two applications started at once.  If we switch to `addCacheIfAbsent`, then when one of them shuts down, the second one will start throwing errors when it tries to use the cache, or possibly when it shuts the cache down.  So you'll still get ehcache errors, you'll just get different ones at different times.\n\nThe problem here actually isn't Play's global state, it's ehcache's global state, which from my investigations, is impossible to work around, ehcache forces every cache manager to put itself into a global singleton of caches.

What's made this one so frustrating to me is that each time I've seen it it's had a different root cause that's never been anything much to do with ehcache (the last time it was in due to the inclusion of something in `play.modules.enable` that diddled with the lifecycle somehow.)\n\nI think this might be one of those cases where it's merciful to catch and rethrow the original exception

reopening this ticket because I think it may be fixable.\n\nAt the moment we're using [`CacheManager.create(InputStream)`](http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.sf.ehcache/ehcache/2.8.6/net/sf/ehcache/CacheManager.java#CacheManager.create%28java.io.InputStream%29) which creates a singleton and puts the `CacheManager` into a global map using a name read from `InputStream`. You can see the code that calls `CacheManager.create()` in Play's [`CacheManagerProvider`](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/master/framework/src/play-cache/src/main/scala/play/api/cache/Cache.scala#L194-L202).\n\nInstead we should update the `CacheManagerProvider` to:\n1. Read the `Configuration` from the `InputStream` ourselves.\n2. Call `Configuration.setName()` to give it a random name so it won't conflict in the global map.\n3. Call [`CacheManager.newInstance(Configuration, ...)`](http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.sf.ehcache/ehcache/2.8.6/net/sf/ehcache/CacheManager.java#CacheManager.newInstance%28java.io.InputStream%29) to create a non-singleton `CacheManager`.\n\nAt least I think that would work.
