When accidentally call `HttpEntity.as(null)`, it should either work all the way by setting the content-type to `None` eventually, or blow up early if this is not an acceptable value.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n1.

If `null` is acceptable in `as`, then it should use `Option` (`Optional.ofNullable` for Java). But if `null` is not acceptable, then `as` is better to throw an exception right away, otherwise, the above trace isn't very straightforward enough to point to this place.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/2.6.x/framework/src/play/src/main/scala/play/api/http/HttpEntity.scala#L83\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/2.6.x/framework/src/play/src/main/java/play/http/HttpEntity.java#L145","closed_by":{"login":"dwijnand","id":344610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDYxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/344610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand","html_url":"https://github.com/dwijnand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8713/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
