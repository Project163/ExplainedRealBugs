The \"problem\" you run into is that after retrieving the `path` of `image.ref` you do not access `image.ref` anymore, so there is no need for the JVM to keep a reference to the object if points to and \"releases\" the object it points to for garbage collection. When the object gets \"destroyed\" it will also remove its temporary file, you can see that here:\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/814d1921b1f8eb7a743db5f93178b49b26fd8232/core/play/src/main/scala/play/api/libs/Files.scala#L281-L286\r\nBecause you force garbage collection and afterwards access the `path`, the file `path` represents is already deleted.\r\nI see you added a `sleep` statement to make sure Garbage collection finished before you call `Files.size` on the temp file. Without the `sleep` statement sometimes the code works, sometimes it fails. Depending if Garbage collection is fast enough to delete the file or not.\r\nNow, for me this is not a bug, but just how this is designed to work. So you have to understand as soon you do not reference `image.ref` anymore you can not be sure that the file it represents on the file system still exists afterwards. So IMHO you have two choices:\r\n1. Either move the temporary file to a different location so it will not be deleted when the `image.ref` gets destroyed and then only work with that \"new\" file, e.g.:\r\n    ```scala\r\n        case Some(image) =>\r\n          for {\r\n            path <- Future(image.ref.atomicMoveWithFallback(someTargetPath))\r\n            ...\r\n    ```\r\n    Be aware that `someTargetPath`/`path` will not be deleted automatically anymore, it's managed by you and you have to make sure to remove it or do whatever you want with it.\r\n1. Do not save a reference to `image.ref.path`. If you do not access `image.ref` anymore it means the file it references is never safe to access. In your code you could do following instead:\r\n    ```scala\r\n          for {\r\n            fsize <- Future(Files.size(image.ref.path))\r\n            _ <- Future(System.gc())\r\n            _ <- Future(Thread.sleep(100))\r\n          } yield Ok(fsize.toString)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] We might want to be more clear about how things work in the documentation:\r\nhttps://www.playframework.com/documentation/3.0.x/ScalaFileUpload#Cleaning-up-temporary-files\r\n\r\n- [ ] Also actually your example makes a good (scripted?) test to make sure that temporary files get deleted when the `ref` object gets destroyed (not sure how intense we test this yet).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/2176517936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mkurz","id":644927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDkyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/644927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz","html_url":"https://github.com/mkurz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkurz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/2177204062","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/12770#issuecomment-2177204062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/12770","id":2177204062,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACO2xc6BxX9e","user":{"login":"tkawachi","id":22657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi","html_url":"https://github.com/tkawachi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkawachi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-18T22:38:55Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T22:59:16Z","body":"Thank you for your response.\r\n\r\nI understand the mechanism, but I feel that not retaining the reference to `image.ref.path` in 2. makes it prone to programming errors and difficult to handle.\r\n\r\nAs a third option, it seems possible to retain the reference to the request until the end.

Could you open a pull request? Would be nice if you could add a test also. fyi, afaik `System.gc()` does not guarantee that GC will actually be triggered, it just asks the JVM to do so. So _in theory_ such a test is not 100% reliable, but I guess since we can both reproduce the exception, you with corretto on macOS and me with Temurin on Linux, _in practise_ we can say it's safe to assume `System.gc()` does what we want for such a
