Just run it via `activator run` and have a look at `/assets/routes.js` in your browser.\n\n/cc @mtrovo \n","closed_by":{"login":"benmccann","id":322311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/322311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/benmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
