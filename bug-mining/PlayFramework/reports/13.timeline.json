The JDK should probably be returning null here.  We actually correctly check for null.\n\nWe can work around this in Play by calling getJarFile and closing that, though looking at the source code, looks like we should conditionally do that based on whether getUseCaches returns true or not (don't close it if it returns true).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/57318827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/68884659","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3459#issuecomment-68884659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3459","id":68884659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODg0NjU5","user":{"login":"EECOLOR","id":1486362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1486362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR","html_url":"https://github.com/EECOLOR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-06T16:00:54Z","updated_at":"2015-01-06T16:00:54Z","body":"Is

However, `JarURLInputStream` has an unexpected side effect in it's `close` method:\n\n``` scala\n  102       class JarURLInputStream extends java.io.FilterInputStream {\n  103           JarURLInputStream (InputStream src) {\n  104               super (src);\n  105           }\n  106           public void close () throws IOException {\n  107               try {\n  108                   super.close();\n  109               } finally {\n  110                   if (!getUseCaches()) {\n  111                       jarFile.close();\n  112                   }\n  113               }\n  114           }\n  115       }\n```\n\nIf it is not using caches, it closes the jar file. So if we want the exact same behaviour without creating an unneeded stream to an entry of the jar file we could use the following code:\n\n``` scala\nif (!jarUrlConnection.getUseCaches) jarUrlConnection.getJarFile.close()\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/69302693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"EECOLOR","id":1486362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1486362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR","html_url":"https://github.com/EECOLOR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/69478825","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3459#issuecomment-69478825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3459","id":69478825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NDc4ODI1","user":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-11T00:50:16Z","updated_at":"2015-01-11T00:50:24Z","body":"Yes, it's the `JarURLConnection` that holds the resource (file descriptor, socket etc) that needs to be closed - this is the case for all `URLConnection`'s.  The `InputStream` you get from it holds no resources, and it costs nothing to get it, but without casting the `URLConnection`, the only way to close a `URLConnection` is to get the input stream and close that, which is why it's done that way currently in the code.  We can (and should) implement the above code for `JarUrlConnection`, but we still need to do the `getInputStream.close` for all other types of url connections (the main other type here would be `FileUrlConnection`, which would be quite common for this code to encounter in dev mode) since we don't want to have to match on every possible type of `URLConnection` that could be returned and implement the method specific to that to close it.\n\nI mentioned the need to check `getUseCaches` in my [original comment](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3459#issuecomment-57318827).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/69478825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":246404918,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDI0NjQwNDkxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/246404918","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-04T23:09:45Z","milestone":{"title":"2.4.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/84008693","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/3459#issuecomment-84008693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3459","id":84008693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MDA4Njkz","user":{"login":"sebdotv","id":2098181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTgxODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2098181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv","html_url":"https://github.com/sebdotv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebdotv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-20T13:14:06Z","updated_at":"2015-03-20T13:14:06Z","body":"We're seeing those also on an internet facing server.
