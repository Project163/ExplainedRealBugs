It looks like the new streaming body parser of multipart/form-data has a bug.\n### Play Version (2.5.x / etc)\n\nPlay! 2.5-RC1, 2.5-RC2, master\n### API (Scala / Java / Neither / Both)\n- Both (Tested both under Mac, and Scala on Mac and Fedora)\n- Akka-Http\n- Netty\n### Operating System (Ubuntu 15.10 / MacOS 10.10 / Windows 10)\n\nI'm on Mac, however I had the same problem on a Linux system which I tested with 2.5-RC1\n### JDK (Oracle 1.8.0_72, OpenJDK 1.8.x, Azul Zing)\n\nOracle JDK from 1.8.0_66 to 1.8.0_74\n### Library Dependencies\n\nI'm just using:\n  \"com.typesafe.play\" %% \"play\" % playVersion,\n  \"com.typesafe.play\" %% \"play-netty-server\" % playVersion,\n  \"com.typesafe.play\" %% \"play-logback\" % playVersion,\n\nor a new activator play-scala-seed with a single route.\n### Expected Behavior\n\nPlease describe the expected behavior of the issue, starting from the first action.\n1. upload a file via `curl -v -F key1=value1 -F upload=@demo_file http://localhost:9003`\n2. should be instantly especially if file is just 5kb (at least not 5000ms)\n### Actual Behavior\n1. upload a file via `curl -v -F key1=value1 -F upload=@demo_file http://localhost:9003`\n2. takes 5000ms to upload even if just doing:\n\n``` scala\n  def multipart = Action { implicit r =>\n    r.body.asMultipartFormData.map { mp =>\n\n      Ok\n    }.getOrElse {\n      BadRequest\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nAnd only having a LoggingFilter:\n\n``` scala\nclass LoggingFilter(implicit val mat: Materializer) extends Filter {\n\n  val logger = Logger(this.getClass)\n\n  def apply(nextFilter: RequestHeader => Future[Result])\n           (requestHeader: RequestHeader): Future[Result] = {\n\n    val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis\n\n    nextFilter(requestHeader).map { result =>\n\n      val endTime = System.currentTimeMillis\n      val requestTime = endTime - startTime\n\n\n      logger.info(s\"${requestHeader.method} ${requestHeader.uri} \" +\n        s\"took ${requestTime}ms and returned ${result.header.status}\")\n\n\n      result.withHeaders(\"Request-Time\" -> requestTime.toString)\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nWithout the filter it takes nearly the same time.\n\nThere is another way of testing it while being in my multipart branch and adding a test like that:\n\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/5698\nhttps://gist.github.com/schmitch/e296dc493bd3c42407f4\n\nActually this will throw a timeout error if you Await.result(ws.url..., 1.seconds)\nHowever the test finishes in 5 seconds:\n\n```\n[info] MultipartUploadSpec\n[info] \n[info] MultipartFormDataUpload should\n[error]   ! upload in fast\n[error]    java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Futures timed out after [1 second] (MultipartUploadSpec.scala:48)\n[error] play.api.libs.ws.multipart.MultipartUploadSpec$$anonfun$2$$anonfun$apply$3$$anonfun$apply$4.apply(MultipartUploadSpec.scala:48)\n[error] play.api.libs.ws.multipart.MultipartUploadSpec$$anonfun$2$$anonfun$apply$3$$anonfun$apply$4.apply(MultipartUploadSpec.scala:45)\n[error] play.api.libs.ws.multipart.MultipartUploadSpec$$anonfun$withServer$1.apply(MultipartUploadSpec.scala:41)\n[error] play.api.test.PlayRunners$class.running(Helpers.scala:76)\n[error] play.api.libs.ws.multipart.MultipartUploadSpec.running(MultipartUploadSpec.scala:20)\n[error] play.api.libs.ws.multipart.MultipartUploadSpec.withServer(MultipartUploadSpec.scala:41)\n[error] play.api.libs.ws.multipart.MultipartUploadSpec.withSimpleServer(MultipartUploadSpec.scala:35)\n[error] play.api.libs.ws.multipart.MultipartUploadSpec$$anonfun$2$$anonfun$apply$3.apply(MultipartUploadSpec.scala:45)\n[error] play.api.libs.ws.multipart.MultipartUploadSpec$$anonfun$2$$anonfun$apply$3.apply(MultipartUploadSpec.scala:45)\n[info] \n[info] \n[info] \n[info] Total for specification MultipartUploadSpec\n[info] Finished in 5 seconds, 456 ms\n[info] 1 example, 2 expectations, 0 failure, 1 error\n```\n\nAlso this is definitly a release blocker and should be fixed before Play! 2.5 will be released\n\nThis Bug actually **only** appears to happen when uploading a File **and** form/data:\n\n```\nschmitch@SHANGHAI:~$ curl -v -F upload=@golang.md http://localhost:9090/\n*   Trying ::1...\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 9090 (#0)\n> POST / HTTP/1.1\n> Host: localhost:9090\n> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0\n> Accept: */*\n> Content-Length: 1226\n> Expect: 100-continue\n> Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=------------------------de08532d19b8790a\n> \n< HTTP/1.1 100 Continue\n< Server: akka-http/2.4.2\n< Date: Tue, 01 Mar 2016 21:09:03 GMT\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n< Request-Time: 11\n< Server: akka-http/2.4.2\n< Date: Tue, 01 Mar 2016 21:09:03 GMT\n< Content-Length: 0\n< \n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\n```\n\n```\nschmitch@SHANGHAI:~$ curl -v -F data=value -F upload=@golang.md http://localhost:9090/\n*   Trying ::1...\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 9090 (#0)\n> POST / HTTP/1.1\n> Host: localhost:9090\n> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0\n> Accept: */*\n> Content-Length: 1324\n> Expect: 100-continue\n> Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=------------------------f2fe80cb9aab7591\n> \n< HTTP/1.1 100 Continue\n< Server: akka-http/2.4.2\n< Date: Tue, 01 Mar 2016 21:08:45 GMT\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n< Request-Time: 5028\n< Server: akka-http/2.4.2\n< Date: Tue, 01 Mar 2016 21:08:50 GMT\n< Content-Length: 0\n< \n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\n```\n\nI always wondered why @jroper didn't had the problem on the Java App, but my Linux Server and my Mac had it. However on my Test App I always had a CSRF Token sent, too.\n","closed_by":{"login":"gmethvin","id":171663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTY2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin","html_url":"https://github.com/gmethvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmethvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/5751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
