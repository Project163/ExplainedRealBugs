deprecated, `ExecutionContext.prepare` is still used by some users to capture thread-local state when running actions. We should call `prepare` when running an `Action`. The following line needs to change:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/f7f4727add26a689e0667eda278c9f20bda70f02/framework/src/play/src/main/scala/play/api/mvc/Action.scala#L97\r\n\r\nThis fix for this is very easy, but to resolve this issue properly we should create an integration test that checks the Action's code runs in the correct thread pool. Maybe a new integration test like `ThreadPoolSpec` so that we don't clutter up the existing tests too much.\r\n\r\nNote that for performance reasons the `mapFuture` call will only run in another thread when the `Action`'s `BodyParser` returns a `SinkAccumulator`, i.e. when the action is called with a streamed body. The integration test will need to take account of this. To use the correct thread pool when processing a strict body we'll need to fix another issue (which I will link to shortly).","closed_by":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
