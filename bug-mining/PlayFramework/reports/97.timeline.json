you don't need an autoplugin (http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Tasks.html#Dynamic+Computations+with), but I'm pretty sure it will still try to compile the documentation.\n\nHere is a example that hide's it:\n\n``` scala\nmappings in Universal ++= Def.taskDyn {\n      // the documentation will only be included if includeDocumentation is true (see: http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Tasks.html#Dynamic+Computations+with)\n      if (includeDocumentation.value) {\n        Def.task{\n          blub.value\n          val docDirectory = (doc in

  }\n      }\n    }.value\n```\n\nwell I guess Universal will somwhere still generate the documentation:\n\n```\n[info] Main Scala API documentation to

to check it.\n\nActually here is the output of inspect universal:mappings before my snippet (truncated):\n\n```\nschmitch@SHANGHAI:~/projects/schmitch/play/demo-play$ sbt \"inspect

doesn't matter if the documentation will still be generated.\n\nalso I can sort of get it working via:\n\n```\nplay.sbt.PlayImport.PlayKeys.includeDocumentation := false\n\npackageDoc in Compile := {
