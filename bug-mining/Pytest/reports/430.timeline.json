https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12328 mentions, the recent upgrade to pytest 8.x.x\r\nresulted in the qualification tests taking forever and a day to complete (well, ~12 hours). \r\nThis PR rolls the version back to the last known working iteration and updates the pytest\r\n8 feature usage. \r\n\r\nThere is also a note in `qualification/requirements.in` to support the reasoning to keep its pytest version\r\nbelow 8. At least for now, until there is a new release of pytest with the fix for the issue raised by @bmerry.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is a corresponding tweak to the Jenkins Qualification pipeline to start the qualification run\r\nat 11pm SAST. With the 8 hour timeout, that should take it through to a reasonable hour before the team\r\nchecks in.\r\n\r\nChecklist (if not applicable, edit to add `(N/A)` and mark as done):\r\n\r\n- [x] If dependencies are added/removed: update `setup.cfg` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`\r\n- [x] (n/a) If modules are added/removed: use `sphinx-apidoc -efo doc/ src/` to update files in `doc/`\r\n- [x] Ensure copyright notices are present and up-to-date\r\n- [x] (n/a) If qualification tests are changed: attach a sample qualification report\r\n- [x] (n/a) If design has changed: ensure documentation is up to date\r\n- [x] (n/a) If ICD-defined sensors have been added: update `fake_servers.py` in katsdpcontroller to match\r\n\r\nCloses NGC-1318.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ska-sa/katgpucbf/issues/763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ska-sa/katgpucbf/issues/763/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
