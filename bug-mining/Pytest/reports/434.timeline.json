Changes\r\n\r\nFix `pytest_ignore_collect` hook implementation to return `None` rather than `False` when the path ought not to be ignored.

Otherwise, the default rules are never applied and e.g. `--ignore` does not work.\r\n\r\nI've also reported https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12383 about the misleading

applicable):\r\n\r\n- [ ] You've added tests (in `tests/`) added which would fail without your patch\r\n- [ ] You've updated the documentation (in `docs/`, in case of behavior changes or new\r\nfeatures)\r\n- [x] You've added a new changelog entry (in `docs/versionhistory.rst`).\r\n\r\nIf this is a trivial change, like a typo fix or a code reformatting, then you can ignore\r\nthese instructions.\r\n\r\n### Updating the changelog\r\n\r\nIf there are no entries after the last release, use `**UNRELEASED**` as the version.\r\nIf, say, your patch fixes issue #999, the entry should look like this:\r\n\r\n`* Fix big bad boo-boo in the pytest plugin (#999\r\n<https://github.com/agronholm/typeguard/issues/999>_; PR by @yourgithubaccount)`\r\n\r\nIf there's no issue linked, just link to your pull request instead by updating the\r\nchangelog after you've created the
