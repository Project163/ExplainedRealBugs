I was using `pytest-factoryboy` which does some magic to the factories (in particular with `SubFactory` - see [this issue](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/69)), making it very easy to create circular dependencies. Would be really nice if `pytest` could better report circular dep.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/431430061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"charlax","id":120501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDUwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax","html_url":"https://github.com/charlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"charlax","id":120501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDUwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax","html_url":"https://github.com/charlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-19T17:10:03Z","updated_at":"2018-10-19T17:10:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/69","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/69/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/69/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/69/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/69","id":372041996,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzIwNDE5OTY=","number":69,"title":"Allow

fixture overridden in the test file, depending on the `company` fixture\r\n4. `contact` fixture overridden in the same file, depending on the `company` fixture.\r\n\r\nNormally it should be fine because `user -> company` and `contact -> company` - there's no cycle. But, because the plugin creates a dependency `company -> contact`, the graph becomes: `user -> company -> contact -> company` and there's a cycle. Yet this cycle is a bit magical - I did not ask for `company.contact` and `contact.company` to be the same... I want a new, unrelated contact to be created for each company.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add an option to disable this for those who don't need it? Or only some whitelisted subfactories?
