So it is foiled by cases like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_clean.py\r\npkg/__init__.py\r\npkg/test_failing.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n`pkg` is not sorted before `test_clean.py` because it is not a test file.\r\n\r\n### Proposed fix\r\n\r\nWhile the whole feels like it can be done more robustly, I propose a simpler fix for now. Instead of `get_last_failed_paths` containing only test files (`test_clean.py`, `pkg/test_failing.py`), have it contain the directories as well (`pkg`). This way `pkg` is sorted before
