definitely not in `sys.path`, and the build dir gets added by `python3 -m pytest`, if I read the docs correctly.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/629986721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ckastner","id":15859947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODU5OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15859947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner","html_url":"https://github.com/ckastner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckastner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/630043580","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7223#issuecomment-630043580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7223","id":630043580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMDA0MzU4MA==","user":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-18T08:55:59Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T08:56:14Z","body":"if
