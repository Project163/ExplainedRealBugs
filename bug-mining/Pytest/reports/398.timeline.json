We have the following collection tree:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Dir pyspacewar>\r\n  <Dir src>\r\n    <Package pyspacewar>\r\n      <Package tests>\r\n        <DoctestModule test_main.py>\r\n          <DoctestItem pyspacewar.tests.test_main.doctest_main>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the `test_main.py` contains an autouse fixture (`fake_game_ui`) that `doctest_main` needs in order to run properly. The fixture doesn't run! It doesn't run because nothing collects the fixtures from (calls `parsefactories()` on) the `test_main.py` `DoctestModule`.\r\n\r\nHow come it only started happening with commit ab63ebb3dc07b89670b96ae97044f48406c44fa0? Turns out it mostly only worked accidentally. Each `DoctestModule` is also collected as a normal `Module`, with the `Module` collected after the `DoctestModule`. For example, if we add a non-doctest test to `test_main.py`, the collection tree looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Dir pyspacewar>\r\n  <Dir src>\r\n    <Package pyspacewar>\r\n      <Package tests>\r\n        <DoctestModule test_main.py>\r\n          <DoctestItem pyspacewar.tests.test_main.doctest_main>\r\n        <Module test_main.py>\r\n          <Function test_it>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, `Module` *does* collect fixtures. When autouse fixtures are collected, they are added to the `_nodeid_autousenames` dict.\r\n\r\nBefore ab63ebb3dc07b89670b96ae97044f48406c44fa0, `DoctestItem` consults  `_nodeid_autousenames` at *setup* time. At this point, the `Module` has collected and so it ended up picking the autouse fixture (this relies on another \"accident\", that the `DoctestModule` and `Module` have the same node ID).\r\n\r\nAfter ab63ebb3dc07b89670b96ae97044f48406c44fa0, `DoctestItem` consults  `_nodeid_autousenames` at *collection* time (= when it's created). At this point, the `Module` hasn't collected yet, so the autouse fixture is not picked out.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple -- have `DoctestModule.collect()` call `parsefactories`. From some testing I've done it shouldn't have negative consequences (I hope).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1930832050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11724493588,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc5-RI_-zwAAAAK61ZMU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/11724493588","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f81c2163cbb88c4b593751bf6a2947e66e6d0f49","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bluetech/pytest/commits/f81c2163cbb88c4b593751bf6a2947e66e6d0f49","created_at":"2024-02-06T22:06:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-06T22:08:11Z","updated_at":"2024-02-06T22:08:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11941","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11941/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11941/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11941/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/11941","id":2121751278,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAjwLdc5mMgiW","number":11941,"title":"doctest:
