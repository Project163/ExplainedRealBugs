I missed this issue.\r\n\r\nSo if I understand correctly, the issue is about *invoking* the hooks, rather than implementing them.\r\n\r\nThe hooks affected are:\r\n\r\n- `pytest_ignore_collect`\r\n- `pytest_collect_file`\r\n- `pytest_pycollect_makemodule`\r\n- `pytest_report_header`\r\n- `pytest_report_collectionfinish`\r\n\r\nBefore we go and try to revert the changes (or just accept them), I'd like to audit plugins to see if this is an issue in practice, i.e. if there are plugins which actually *invoke* these, and how difficult it will be to make them compatible. Usually of course, only pytest invokes its hooks. I'll try to do it soon.

hooks, which will hamper making improvements.\r\n\r\n> if we had hook invocation as a private property, i'd agree with the minor bump, but it is a public attribute, it gets a major bump\r\n\r\nThe
