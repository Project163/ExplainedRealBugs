 are you setting up your `PYTHONPATH`? I managed to get your example to work by putting `ns/python/bar` and `ns/python/foo` in the `PYTHONPATH`, which seems to be [the recommendation for using namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages).\r\n\r\n```\r\nλ python -m pytest .tmp\\ns\\python --import-mode=importlib -o consider_namespace_packages=true --no-header\r\n======================== test session starts ========================\r\ncollected 2 items\r\n\r\n.tmp\\ns\\python\\bar\\ns\\bar\\test\\test_bar.py .

thanks again for looking into this! The example I provided was incomplete. When I adding `__init__.py` files to `python/ns/bar/ns/bar/__init__.py` and `python/ns/foo/ns/foo/__init__.py`, so python / setuptools would recognize them as actual submodules (as you alluded to) `pytest` ran successfully! \r\n\r\nIn the project I thought I discovered this bug in, it turns out there was an erroneous `__init__.py` file at the same level as a submodule's `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` / `setup.cfg` (e.g. `python/ns/bar/__init__.py`). For some reason `pytest==8.0.2` did not balk at this and collected correctly, however with `pytest==8.1.1`, I received `ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package` and `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'some-module'` errors. I think that is the correct behavior per PEP 420.\r\n\r\n@joshbode, great catch!
