2017 there was an issue #2430 complaining that module-level calls to `warnings.filterwarnings` are getting reset by pytest and thus have no effect. PR #2445 added a fix for this and a test [testing/test_warnings.py::test_works_with_filterwarnings](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/80dfa2db8e6157bf706c2f2656ba0fd7bc13195a/testing/test_warnings.py#L152-L173) (still present).\n\nIn 2018 there was a change to add warning capture during collection 1a9d913ee1f9d1a56448f659649c96214f6d9645. This means collection is now wrapped in a `with warnings.catch_warnings` and so all `warnings.filterwarnings` get reset after collection, regressing the issue #2430.\n\nThe tests continued to pass due to how it was written, however running pytest with `-Wdefault` causes it to (correctly) fail (see #13480).\n\nSince we haven't received any complaints since it regressed, and a fix I think would be difficult, IMO we should just delete the test, basically WONTFIXing #2430.
