\r\n\r\n`pytest.fail()` and `pytest.skip()` and `pytest.xfail()` are there for situations where you don't want to check for a condition at *module level*, which is when the condition is evaluated for marks. \r\n\r\nConsider:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport slow_module_to_import\r\n@pytest.mark.xfail(slow_module_to_import.very_slow_function(), reason=\"...\")\r\ndef test_foo():\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nVs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_foo():\r\n    import slow_module_to_import\r\n    if slow_module_to_import.very_slow_function():\r\n        pytest.xfail(reason=\"...\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerformance is not the only reason too, sometimes your condition needs to access things which are not available at module import time (access a database, read a config file, etc.)\r\n\r\n> Will that be deprecated in the future in favour of marking?\r\n\r\nNo plans at all.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nicoddemus in https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6288#issuecomment-559765982_","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6289/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6289/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
