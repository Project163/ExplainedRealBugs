looked at the older but similar issue #4017 and the newer (very similar but not the same) #6962.\r\nThis problem cannot be related to #6962 because I'm in the 4.6.x branch of Pytest.  It could be related to #4017, maybe caused by the fix put in at that time.  I'm not sure.  I have not looked backward to see when this might have worked.\r\n\r\nI'm working on Windows (7 actually) and I'm using Pytest to test C++ built binaries - because Pytest is so clear and expressive at the site of the test case.  I build my c++ component in both 32 and 64-bit versions and both MSVCRT versions (eckk   I know).\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyhow I have a test suite that is appropriate to run against every version of the built binary - so I started trying to use pytest_generate_tests() to create a session-scoped fixture that is parameterized based on cmd-line arguments.  The command line can specify either/or or both of either choice. When the cmd-line says to test both - the session-scoped fixture will have multiple parameters, so I'm expecting the whole test suite should run multiple times, and the session fixture should create & finalize only once for each parameter of this new fixture..\r\n\r\nHere's the smallest example I could build that easily demonstrates both behaviors.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\r\n# conftest.py\r\nfrom __future__ import print_function\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\ndef pytest_addoption(parser):\r\n    parser.addoption('--arch', choices=['all','32','64'], default='64')\r\n    parser.addoption('--crt', choices=['all','static','dynamic'], default='static')\r\n\r\n##################################################################\r\n# Use this to control WHICH session-scoped parameterized fixture to use\r\nif True:\r\n    # Dynamically created session-scoped parameterized fixture\r\n    def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n        if 'platstr' in metafunc.fixturenames:\r\n            (arch, crt) = [metafunc.config.getoption(o) for o in ['--arch','--crt']]\r\n            archs = [v for v in ['32','64'] if arch in ['all'] + [v]]\r\n            crts = [v for v in ['static','dynamic'] if crt in ['all'] + [v]]\r\n            plats = ['win{}-{}'.format(a,c) for a in archs for c in crts]\r\n            metafunc.parametrize('platstr', plats, scope='session')\r\nelse:\r\n    # Hard coded session-scoped parameterized fixture\r\n    @pytest.fixture(scope='session', params=['win64-static'])\r\n    def platstr(request):\r\n        return request.param\r\n##################################################################\r\n\r\n@pytest.fixture(scope='session', autouse=True)\r\ndef env(request, platstr):\r\n    print('\\nCreating:   TestEnv({})'.format(platstr), end='')\r\n    def finalize():\r\n        print('\\n\\tFinalizing TestEnv', end='')\r\n    request.addfinalizer(finalize)\r\n    return platstr\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny test case with parameterization shows the trouble:\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\r\n# demo.py\r\nimport pytest\r\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('raw_data', ['asdf','qwer'])\r\ndef test_param_case(raw_data):\r\n    assert raw_data\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the output of `pytest demo.py -s` as pasted above:\r\n```\r\n(venv) D:\\pytest-testing>pytest demo.py -s\r\n============================= test session starts =============================\r\nplatform win32 -- Python 2.7.14, pytest-4.6.9, py-1.8.1, pluggy-0.13.1\r\nrootdir: D:\\pytest-testing\r\ncollected 2 items\r\n\r\ndemo.py\r\nCreating:   TestEnv(win64-static).\r\n        Finalizing TestEnv\r\nCreating:   TestEnv(win64-static).\r\n        Finalizing TestEnv\r\n\r\n========================== 2 passed in 0.06 seconds ===========================\r\n\r\n(venv) D:\\pytest-testing>\r\n```\r\nIn that output -
