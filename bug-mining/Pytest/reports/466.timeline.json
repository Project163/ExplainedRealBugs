`pytester` tests that require `pexpect` are silently skipped if `pexpect` is unavailable:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/f373974707f57a0b28d12563e4d03c7cd54c70d9/src/_pytest/pytester.py#L1513\r\n\r\n- We default to not installing `pexpect` even on CI, only having it as an optional dependency with a `-pexpect` factor:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/f373974707f57a0b28d12563e4d03c7cd54c70d9/tox.ini#L79\r\n\r\n- The only CI environment where we include that is a Python 3.8 one:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/f373974707f57a0b28d12563e4d03c7cd54c70d9/.github/workflows/test.yml#L116-L120\r\n\r\n- Yet, we have 40 (!) selftests that use `pexpect` - most notably, most of [test_debugging.py](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/testing/test_debugging.py) (38 of 59 skipped)\r\n\r\n- And that caused us to miss #12497 on our own CI\r\n\r\nWhy is pexpect an optional factor at all? From what I can gather, that was introduced in bd8a2cc18c1898673665023556e73134e78e4d75 because \"it doesn't install on Windows anymore\" back in 2013.\r\n\r\nNowadays, it [seems to be partially available for Windows](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#windows), though not `pexpect.spawn` which we use for `Pytester.spawn()`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/f373974707f57a0b28d12563e4d03c7cd54c70d9/src/_pytest/pytester.py#L1508-L1522\r\n\r\nI think we should either:\r\n\r\n- Figure out if we can change `Pytester` in a backwards-compatible way to use the cross-platform [`PopenSpawn`](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/popen_spawn.html#pexpect.popen_spawn.PopenSpawn) instead. Pexpect claims:\r\n\r\n> `PopenSpawn` is not a direct replacement for `spawn`. Many programs only offer interactive behaviour if they detect that they are running in a terminal. When run by `PopenSpawn`, they may behave differently.\r\n\r\n- Or if not, at least install `pexpect` unconditionally on Linux (and perhaps macOS) as part of our dev dependencies, using a [environment marker](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/#environment-markers) (added in pip 6.0 in 2014, so that wasn't an option back when the tox factor was introduced).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12884/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2408932683","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12497#issuecomment-2408932683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12497","id":2408932683,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc6PlWVL","user":{"login":"bluthej","id":29771403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzcxNDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29771403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej","html_url":"https://github.com/bluthej","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluthej/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-13T11:04:48Z","updated_at":"2024-10-13T11:04:48Z","body":"@The-Compiler I'm actually on Linux, but I realize that I should have mentioned that I installed Python 3.13 with `uv`, which means that I'm actually using a version from [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone) so it might be due to that...
