In large code bases switching is a longer task and requires multiple commits and work of multiple people\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be great if there would be an option to block the usage of these \"old\" fixtures, e.g. by a \"future mode\" or a warning which can be changed to an error with warning filters. \r\n\r\nWith this, \r\n1) it is easy to find, where a code change is needed\r\n2) after switching to `pathlib` only, future usage is blocked\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Solutions\r\n* Using a linter, which is quite hard tue the dynamic calculation of fixtures","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
