This broke the tests in `pytest-twisted`...  and while I setup nightly 'cron' builds I apparently didn't bother to notice when they broke awhile ago.  :[  I do not know what the proper answer is here especially now that we have multiple versions out with each approach.  Since `pytest-twisted` is still supporting py2, I don't get to just update to latest pytest functionality across the board.  Though yes, py2 support will at some point be dropped when the pain is sufficient.\r\n\r\nI'll just normalize the `parseoutcomes()` dict keys myself but wanted to document the change and see what opinions there are on it.\r\n\r\nWhen `pytest-twisted` broke:\r\nlast good `pytest==5.2.4`: https://travis-ci.org/pytest-dev/pytest-twisted/jobs/614201584\r\nfirst bad `pytest==5.3.0`: https://travis-ci.org/pytest-dev/pytest-twisted/jobs/614718766\r\n\r\nIntroduced in #5989 and https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/d863c30c743138ed29cdf786cb18c41c24983fe1.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be little testing being done on `parseoutcomes()`.\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/e98176cf50c5b2d3df965ec409d7f62fefcd9ebd/testing/test_pytester.py#L687-L706\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/e98176cf50c5b2d3df965ec409d7f62fefcd9ebd/testing/test_capture.py#L1161-L1191\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
