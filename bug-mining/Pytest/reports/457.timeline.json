importlib\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I've made sure that tests are updated accordingly (especially if adding or updating a template option)\r\n- [x] I've updated the documentation or confirm that my change doesn't require any updates\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nBased on https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/goodpractices.html#choosing-an-import-mode :\r\n\r\n\"For historical reasons, pytest defaults to the prepend import mode instead of the importlib import mode we recommend for new projects. The reason lies in the way the prepend mode works:\r\n\r\nSince there are no packages to derive a full package name from, pytest will import your test files as top-level modules. The test files in the first example (src layout) would be imported as test_app and test_view top-level modules by adding tests/ to sys.path.\r\n\r\nThis results in a drawback compared to the import mode importlib: your test files must have unique names. (...)\r\nThe importlib import mode does not have any of the drawbacks above, because sys.path is not changed when importing test modules.\r\n\"\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWhy does this project need the change you're proposing?\r\nIf this pull request fixes an open issue, don't forget to link it with `Fix #NNNN`\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django/issues/4950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django/issues/4950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2283457165","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12659#issuecomment-2283457165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12659","id":2283457165,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc6IGsqN","user":{"login":"dongfangtianyu","id":7629022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjkwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7629022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu","html_url":"https://github.com/dongfangtianyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfangtianyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-12T09:08:35Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T09:08:50Z","body":"To

appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [X] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [X] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [X] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved
