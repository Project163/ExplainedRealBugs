issue arises because `Failure.__init__` in Twisted 25 can receive a non-None `exc_value` while `exc_tb` is `None`. In such cases, `ExceptionInfo[BaseException].from_exc_info` fails, as it expects a traceback to be present when `sys.exc_info()` returns a tuple. This leads to the error message `'NoneType' object is not iterable`.\r\n\r\nImplemented separate workarounds for Twisted 24 and Twisted 25, the later one being simpler and less intrusive in the long run, as it does not require monkeypatching `Failure.__init__`.\r\n\r\nWe can drop suppor for Twisted 24 and keep the simpler patch in a later release.\r\n\r\nFixes

is a backport of PR #13502 as merged into main (01dce85a89eb0b3e881303784267f14b94d9691f).**\n\nThe issue arises because `Failure.__init__` in Twisted 25 can receive a non-None `exc_value` while `exc_tb` is `None`. In such cases, `ExceptionInfo[BaseException].from_exc_info` fails, as it expects a traceback to be present when `sys.exc_info()` returns a tuple. This leads to the error message `'NoneType' object is not iterable`.\r\n\r\nImplemented separate workarounds for Twisted 24 and Twisted 25, the later one being simpler and less intrusive in the long run, as it does not require monkeypatching `Failure.__init__`.\r\n\r\nWe can drop suppor for Twisted 24 and keep the simpler patch in a later release.\r\n\r\nFixes #13497\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
