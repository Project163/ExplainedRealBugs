It needs to include an example of BibLaTex file which has additional software specific metadata. I had tried importing the BibTex into a citation manager like Zotero, and it indicated that the citation was a document. However, using BibLaTex will indicate that it is of the type software. This facilitates citation. Also, the authors section of the example is incorrectly formatted. The author names should be \"{firstname} {lastname}\" and not \"{lastname}, {firstname}\". The version information should also be included in a note for the BibTex format.  Finally, it needs an example of how to create a BibLaTex format in the CITATION.\n\n\nI corrected the issue and will submit a pull request for it shortly.\n\n- [ X] a detailed description of the bug or problem you are having\n- [ N/A] output of `pip list` from the virtual environment you are using\n- [ N/A] pytest and operating system versions\n- [ X] minimal example if possible\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
