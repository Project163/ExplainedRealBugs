Is there something we can do to keep the original -vv behaviour for the test output, and keep the \"short test summary\" short ? It's actually quite useful in CI that the last thing printed is the list of tests that failed and not why each of them failed: it's a summary and the full output is available above anyway.\r\n\r\nI think the decision a lot of versions ago to add an excerpt of the failure reason to the short summary was a good compromise: it used otherwise unused space to add more useful info. But if that excerpt start taking more screen real estate space (potentially 100x more) than the summary itself, I'm not sure I understand why we would want that?\r\n\r\nMaybe we could introduce a different \"letter\" (or a different option or something) to `-r` to get the list of tests without any kind of explanation of why they failed? Maybe the fix for #11777 should have affected the \"failure explanation\" and not the short summary?\r\n\r\n### output of `pip list` from the virtual environment you are using\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ pip list\r\npip list\r\nPackage   Version\r\n--------- -------\r\niniconfig 2.0.0\r\npackaging 24.1\r\npip       24.0\r\npluggy    1.5.0\r\npytest    8.3.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### pytest and operating system versions\r\n\r\n`pytest==8.3.2`\r\n`Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS`\r\n\r\n\r\n### minimal example if possible\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_foo():\r\n    assert \"a\\n\" * 50 == \"\"\r\n```\r\n```console\r\n$ pytest -vv\r\n============================================================== test session starts ===============================================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.12.4, pytest-8.3.2, pluggy-1.5.0 -- /home/joachim/other-src/pytest-verbose/.venv/bin/python3.12\r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: /home/joachim/other-src/pytest-verbose\r\ncollected 1 item                                                                                                                                 \r\n\r\ntest_verbose.py::test_foo FAILED                                                                                                           [100%]\r\n\r\n==================================================================== FAILURES ====================================================================\r\n____________________________________________________________________ test_foo ____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n    def test_foo():\r\n>       assert \"a\\n\" * 50 == \"\"\r\nE       AssertionError: assert 'a\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\n' == ''\r\nE         \r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\nE         + a\r\n\r\ntest_verbose.py:2: AssertionError\r\n============================================================ short test summary info =============================================================\r\nFAILED test_verbose.py::test_foo -
