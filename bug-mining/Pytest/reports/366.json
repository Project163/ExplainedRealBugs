One is created even if the `request` fixture is not explicitly requested.  The name is a bit confusing -- it is not a request for a fixture. I think it wanted to be named `RequestFixture` i.e. the `request` fixture, but not 100% sure.\r\n    \r\n   A test function itself cannot be parametrized using `request.param`, only a fixture can.\r\n    \r\n   For `FixtureRequest` the `request.scope` is always `function` and the `request.node` is the item.\r\n    \r\n    In the pytest internals, it is used to drive getting the fixture values of the fixtures needed by the item (`_fillfixtures`).\r\n    \r\n- `SubRequest` is used for `request` inside a fixture. The `SubRequest` holds a reference to the `FixtureDef` it handles.\r\n    \r\n   For parametrized fixtures it holds the parameter value (`request.param`).\r\n    \r\n   In the pytest internals, it is used to drive the execution of a specific \"fixture request\" .\r\n    \r\n  While executing an item, the `SubRequest`s and the top `FixtureRequest` form a chain/stack. For example, if we have `test_it` requesting `fix1` requesting `fix2`, then there is `SubRequest(fix2)` which points to `SubRequest(fix1)` which points to `FixtureRequest(test_it)`. This is only used in practice for printing a \"fixture stack\" in some errors, but is useful to understand conceptually.\r\n\r\n`SubRequest` inherits from `FixtureRequest`, but in a pretty hard to understand way, e.g. its `__init__` doesn't call the super.\r\n\r\nAs an initial way to clarify things a bit, I propose making `FixtureRequest` itself abstract, and add a new `TopRequest` subclass for the test-function `request`.\r\n\r\nThe name `TopRequest` would not be my TopChoice, but renaming `FixtureRequest` or `SubRequest` at this point would be a disruptive breaking change, so better to choose a name which makes sense in relation to `SubRequest`.\r\n\r\nThis will break plugins which instantiate `FixtureRequest` directly. It's private so not an official breaking change. I found `pytest-alembic`, `pytest-yield`, `pytest-wdl`, `pytest-play`. I can notify them about this change if this proposal is accepted.","closed_by":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
