Description\n\nFixes #13816\n\nThis PR improves the error message when using `pytest.approx()` to compare dictionaries with different keys.\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen dictionaries have different keys, the current error message is confusing:\n\n```\nAssertionError: assert approx({'a': ... 4 ± 4.0e-06}) == {'a': 1, 'c': 3}\n(pytest_assertion plugin: representation of details failed: KeyError: 'b'.\nProbably an object has a faulty __repr__.)\n```\n\nThis suggests there's a problem with `__repr__`, but the real issue is just that the dict keys don't match.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdded a clear check for key mismatch before attempting value comparison:\n\n```python\nexpected_keys = set(self.expected.keys())\nother_keys = set(other_side.keys())\nif expected_keys \\!= other_keys:\n    # Return clear error message\n```\n\n## New Error Message\n\n```\nAssertionError: Dictionaries have different keys.\nExpected keys: ['a', 'c'], Actual keys: ['a', 'b']\n```\n\n## Changes\n\n**File**: `src/_pytest/python_api.py`\n- Added key comparison check in `ApproxMapping._repr_compare()`\n- Returns early with clear message if keys don't match\n- Shows which keys are in expected vs actual\n\n**File**: `testing/test_approx_dict_keys_13816.py` (NEW)\n- 4 focused test cases covering different scenarios\n\n## ✅ Testing\n\n```python\ndef test_approx_dicts_with_different_keys_clear_error():\n    expected = {\"a\": 1, \"c\": 3}\n    actual = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 4}\n    \n    with pytest.raises(AssertionError) as exc_info:\n        assert pytest.approx(actual) == expected\n    \n    error_message = str(exc_info.value)\n    assert \"different keys\" in error_message.lower()  # ✅\n    assert \"KeyError\" not in error_message  # ✅\n    assert \"faulty __repr__\" not in error_message  # ✅\n```\n\n**Test Cases**:\n- Different keys → Clear error message\n- Extra key in expected → Detected\n- Extra key in actual → Detected\n- Matching keys → Normal approx behavior still works\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Clearer UX**: Users immediately understand the issue\n- **No false leads**: Eliminates confusing KeyError/`__repr__` messages\n- **Minimal change**: Only affects error path, no behavior changes\n- **Well-tested**: 4 test cases cover edge cases\n\n**Sacred Code**:
