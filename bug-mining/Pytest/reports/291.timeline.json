also noticed an unexpected change in behavior in our CI with v7.1.0 that looks related to this.\r\n\r\nWe're calling `pytest --pyargs module_name` where `module_name` is an installed module and at the same time in the current working directory there is a file that contains a pytest config block with a list of markers.\r\n\r\nWith v7.1.0, it seems like the fixtures in the installed `module_name.tests.conftest` are not loaded when the local settings are present. If we delete the pytest config block from the local file then the fixtures are loaded and the test suite can run without errors (but with warnings about unknown markers).\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to matter whether the config block is in `setup.cfg` or `pyproject.toml`.\r\n\r\nI don't have a proper minimal example at this point, but you can replicate this with:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/explosion/thinc/v8.0.14/requirements.txt\r\npip install thinc==8.0.14\r\npip install pytest==7.1.0\r\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/explosion/thinc/v8.0.14/setup.cfg\r\npytest --pyargs thinc.tests.test_config::test_config_roundtrip_disk_respects_path_subclasses\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error is a missing fixture:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  def test_config_roundtrip_disk_respects_path_subclasses(pathy_fixture):\r\nE       fixture 'pathy_fixture' not found\r\n>       available fixtures: cache, capfd, capfdbinary, caplog, capsys, capsysbinary, cov, doctest_namespace, monkeypatch, no_cover, pytestconfig, record_property, record_testsuite_property, record_xml_attribute, recwarn, tmp_path, tmp_path_factory, tmpdir, tmpdir_factory\r\n>       use 'pytest --fixtures [testpath]' for help on them.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`pathy_fixture` is defined in `thinc.tests.conftest`: https://github.com/explosion/thinc/blob/v8.0.14/thinc/tests/conftest.py\r\n\r\nIf you downgrade to `pytest==7.0.1` there are no errors, or if you delete `setup.cfg` with v7.1.0 there are potentially marker warnings but no errors.\r\n\r\nWe've always had a bit of trouble with the options and marker definitions in `conftest.py` when running the test suite from within an installed module vs. a local directory, so it's possible there's another interaction there. The goal is to add a `--slow` option, but we've never gotten it to work 100% as intended for installed modules. We've mainly been using the local ini file to get rid of the marker warnings in the CI.\r\n\r\nThere didn't seem to be anything specific to OS or python versions in the CI errors we've seen so far.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>pip list for reference:</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nPackage             Version\r\n------------------- -------\r\nasttokens           2.0.5  \r\nattrs               21.4.0

[pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) from 7.0.1 to 7.1.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/releases\">pytest's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>7.1.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 7.1.0 (2022-03-13)</h1>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8838\">#8838</a>: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 6.X series and are now\nremoved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pytest._fillfuncargs</code> function.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_warning_captured</code> hook - use <code>pytest_warning_recorded</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>-k -foobar</code> syntax - use <code>-k 'not foobar'</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>-k foobar:</code> syntax.</li>\n<li><code>pytest.collect</code> module - import from <code>pytest</code> directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information consult\n<a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html\">Deprecations and Removals</a> in the docs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9437\">#9437</a>: Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached <a href=\"https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches\">end-of-life</a> at 2021-12-23.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5192\">#5192</a>: Fixed test output for some data types where <code>-v</code> would show less information.</p>\n<p>Also, when showing diffs for sequences, <code>-q</code> would produce full diffs instead of the expected diff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9362\">#9362</a>: pytest now avoids specialized assert formatting when it is detected that the default <code>__eq__</code> is overridden in <code>attrs</code> or <code>dataclasses</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9536\">#9536</a>: When <code>-vv</code> is given on command line, show skipping and xfail reasons in full instead of truncating them to fit the terminal width.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9644\">#9644</a>: More information about the location of resources that led Python to raise <code>ResourceWarning</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} can now\nbe obtained by enabling <code>tracemalloc</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;mod&quot;}.</p>\n<p>See <code>resource-warnings</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9678\">#9678</a>: More types are now accepted in the <code>ids</code> argument to <code>@pytest.mark.parametrize</code>.\nPreviously only [str]{.title-ref}, [float]{.title-ref}, [int]{.title-ref} and [bool]{.title-ref} were accepted;\nnow [bytes]{.title-ref}, [complex]{.title-ref}, [re.Pattern]{.title-ref}, [Enum]{.title-ref} and anything with a [__name__]{.title-ref} are also accepted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9692\">#9692</a>: <code>pytest.approx</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} now raises a <code>TypeError</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} when given an unordered sequence (such as <code>set</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}).</p>\n<p>Note that this implies that custom classes which only implement <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__len__</code> are no longer supported as they don't guarantee order.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8242\">#8242</a>: The deprecation of raising <code>unittest.SkipTest</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} to skip collection of\ntests during the pytest collection phase is reverted - this is now a supported\nfeature again.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9493\">#9493</a>: Symbolic link components are no longer resolved in conftest paths.\nThis means that if a conftest appears twice in collection tree, using symlinks, it will be executed twice.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
