for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\nThis resolves #10617 and adds more powerful set assertion rewrites for comparisons other than equality ``==``. Previously, only ``==`` was supported for sets. Now, the additional following operations are supported: ``!=``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``<``, and ``>``.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11469/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10530884990,"node_id":"CE_lADOAjwLdc5aMj2HzwAAAAJzsI1-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/10530884990","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-02T21:37:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10530885512,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc5aMj2HzwAAAAJzsI-I","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/10530885512","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9bbfe995eed5c0f32a726d3c3fb98a474c87dc44","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/commits/9bbfe995eed5c0f32a726d3c3fb98a474c87dc44","created_at":"2023-10-02T21:37:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
