I've learned about it from [here](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/113406672373007116). Screenshot of how it will look in Gnome (Linux) from [here](https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2024/12/03/ptyxis-progress-support/). Seems like a good fit for pytest, allowing a user start a pytest run, do something in another tab and see at a glance the pytest progress.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c3d8c1-3e4c-4457-aaf7-08e26a94c063)\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe sequence is [documented here](https://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#ConEmu_specific_OSC).\r\n\r\nIt should be implemented in the terminal plugin, in `TerminalReporter`, probably in `pytest_runtest_logreport`.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is that it's a global effect on the terminal tab, which pytest doesn't have until now as far as I remember. But it's probably fine and if someone complains we can make it optional.","closed_by":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13072/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13072/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
