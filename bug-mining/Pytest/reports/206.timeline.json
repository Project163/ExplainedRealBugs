did some investigation and it appears that the issue is that `pytest` is now using `Path().resolve()` to resolve paths (including the current directory).\r\n\r\nThis means that the paths reported on a run become wrong (they're no longer reporting the current directory, they are reporting the resolved directory).\r\n\r\ni.e.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> c:\r\n> cd \\\r\n> mkdir foo\r\n> subst f: c:\\foo\r\n> python -c \"import pathlib;print(pathlib.Path().resolve())\"\r\n  C:\\foo\r\n> python -c \"import pathlib;print(pathlib.Path().absolute())\"\r\n  F:\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, given this, creating a file on `F:\\test_loc.py` with the contents below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef test_path_error_location():\r\n    raise AssertionError()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output when running it from `F:` is the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\npy.test test_loc.py\r\n================================= test session starts ================================== \r\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.7.6, pytest-5.3.2, py-1.8.1,

issue is same as microsoft/vscode-python#5139, microsoft/vscode-python#225 and microsoft/vscode-python#4166\r\nwhich closed and those suggest updating python ext, but mine is already up to

microsoft/vscode-python#1313 are similar in nature.\r\n\r\nand no, This is not the case of lowercase drive letters as said in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/2976#issuecomment-431946411\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the breakpoints if marked in the original file, are carried over but can't be disabled from the new file. As well as breakpoints created in the new file are not migrated back to original file. i.e. the breakpoints are treated different. \r\n\r\nThis leads to confusion in debugging as you just cannot see why the debugger is halting\r\nIf I want to remove a breakpoint, I have to use the breakpoints explorer. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16190134/74835963-712ede80-5344-11ea-92d0-b1a112ad6ac7.png)\r\nThis is the look of breakpoints explorer in debugger\r\n\r\nAnd by habbit , assuming that the file being debugged is displayed, I start editing the file and save it, which propagates the contents to the original file, but the breakpoints in the original file are now ordered very differently, thus making the debugger stop everywhere. Which is just annoying.\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce the issue are mentioned here : \r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/225#issue-273959633\r\n\r\nand examples are here :\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/4166#issue-403825856\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, When I created a new Project, I was unable to produce the same result.\r\nThen I thought that It may be because I have multiple Launch configurations in my project,\r\nbut testing with two launch configs in the new project does not seem to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nI will try to provide as much info I can on this\r\n\r\nThe python interpreter is a conda env and code was started from conda powershell prompt in both cases\r\n\r\nSystem Info:\r\n\r\nAMD R7 1700 @3GHZ\r\nRAM 16GB, 52%
