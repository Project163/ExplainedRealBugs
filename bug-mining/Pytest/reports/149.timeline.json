new version was just released of `pytest`, so [Doppins](https://doppins.com)\nhas upgraded your project's dependency ranges.\n\nMake sure that it doesn't break anything, and happy merging! :shipit:\n\n---\n### Upgraded pytest from `==3.2.3` to `==5.1.1`\n\n#### Changelog:\n\n#### Version 5.1.1\npytest 5.1.1 (2019-08-20)\n=========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n-   \\`#5751` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751`): Fixed\n    `TypeError` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.\n\n\n\n#### Version 5.1.0\npytest 5.1.0 (2019-08-15)\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nRemovals\r\n--------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5180` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180`): As per\r\n    our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X\r\n    series and are now removed:\r\n\r\n    -   `Request.getfuncargvalue`: use `Request.getfixturevalue`\r\n        instead.\r\n    -   `pytest.raises` and `pytest.warns` no longer support strings as\r\n        the second argument.\r\n    -   `message` parameter of `pytest.raises`.\r\n    -   `pytest.raises`, `pytest.warns` and `ParameterSet.param` now use\r\n        native keyword-only syntax. This might change the exception\r\n        message from previous versions, but they still raise `TypeError`\r\n        on unknown keyword arguments as before.\r\n    -   `pytest.config` global variable.\r\n    -   `tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp` method.\r\n    -   `pytest_logwarning` hook.\r\n    -   `RemovedInPytest4Warning` warning type.\r\n    -   `request` is now a reserved name for fixtures.\r\n\r\n    For more information consult [Deprecations and\r\n    Removals](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html) in\r\n    the docs.\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5565` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565`): Removed\r\n    unused support code for\r\n    [unittest2](https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/).\r\n\r\n    The `unittest2` backport module is no longer necessary since Python\r\n    3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also\r\n    doesn\\'t seem to be used: after removed, all tests still pass\r\n    unchanged.\r\n\r\n    Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before\r\n    removing any features or support for third party libraries, because\r\n    this code is apparently not used at all (even if `unittest2` is used\r\n    by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to remove it in\r\n    this release.\r\n\r\n    If you experience a regression because of this, please [file an\r\n    issue](`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new`).\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5615` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615`):\r\n    `pytest.fail`, `pytest.xfail` and `pytest.skip` no longer support\r\n    bytes for the message argument.\r\n\r\n    This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use\r\n    `\"message\"` instead of `u\"message\"`.\r\n\r\n    Python 3 code is unlikely to pass `bytes` to these functions.
