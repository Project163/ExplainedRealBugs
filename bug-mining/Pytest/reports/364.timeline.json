But then when I try and run a given test via its testID it doesn't work and returns the error you see in the second run even though its root dir is still listed as `rootdir: /Users/eleanorboyd/testingFiles/from_users/test_directory/tests`\r\n\r\nFrom what I got of the doc is that all testIDs would be relative to the rootDir and therefore the testID when the rootdir stays the same should also be the same.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am experiencing this bug is I want to get testIDs from a plugin and then be able to call the given test from the command line. Is this actually a bug or am I getting the testID incorrectly somewhere or misunderstanding the docs in that the testID is relative to the rootdir?\r\n\r\nAppreciate any help!\r\n\r\nTO REPRO:\r\nrun script.py from the following example code I uploaded\r\n[test_directory.zip](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/files/12113626/test_directory.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output of pip list:**\r\nPackage        Version\r\n-------------- -------\r\nexceptiongroup 1.1.2\r\niniconfig      2.0.0\r\npackaging      23.1\r\npip            23.2\r\npluggy         1.2.0\r\npytest         7.4.0\r\nsetuptools     65.4.1\r\ntomli          2.0.1\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!
