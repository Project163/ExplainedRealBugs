not so sure what to do about this. The idea of #7710 was to use approximate comparison whenever `(expected-obtained)` was allowed by the target types, only falling back to equality for non arithmetic types. `int-bool` _is_ allowed (in contrast to `Enum-Enum`), so `True == approx(False, abs=2)` is _technically_ correct as you point out.\r\n\r\nOne straightforward solution to special-case the equality fallback, so approximate comparisons are used for all subclasses of `Decimal` and `Complex`, but not for `bool`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/982494086/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jvansanten","id":938705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzODcwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/938705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten","html_url":"https://github.com/jvansanten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5691116001,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc4_mFhszwAAAAFTN4nh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/5691116001","actor":{"login":"jvansanten","id":938705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzODcwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/938705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten","html_url":"https://github.com/jvansanten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f11965783cf9de51d999fa7c3f15ceec4036439a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jvansanten/pytest/commits/f11965783cf9de51d999fa7c3f15ceec4036439a","created_at":"2021-11-30T10:57:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jvansanten","id":938705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzODcwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/938705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten","html_url":"https://github.com/jvansanten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvansanten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-30T10:58:43Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T10:58:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9354","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9354/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9354/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9354/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/9354","id":1067091367,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAjwLdc4vLlgX","number":9354,"title":"Use

Summary\r\n\r\nAllow the tests to pass with pytest version 8.3.4 by changing the test code. The GitHub macOS conda action is updated to macos-13 (for the Intel build). There is no functional change here.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nFix #2202.\r\n\r\nIn pytest 8.3.3 and earlier\r\n    \r\n        >>> import numpy as np; import pytest\r\n        >>> pytest.__version__\r\n        '8.3.3'\r\n        >>> np.ones(2, dtype=bool) == pytest.approx([True, True])\r\n        True\r\n    \r\nHowever, pytest 8.3.4 now causes this to fail\r\n    \r\n        >>> import numpy as np; import pytest\r\n        >>> pytest.__version__\r\n        '8.3.4'\r\n        >>> np.ones(2, dtype=bool) == pytest.approx([True, True])\r\n        False\r\n    \r\nThis is because of \"pytest.approx considers boolean numeric types\"\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9353\r\n    \r\nThe solution is to make the \"expected\" value be a ndarray, and so\r\n    \r\n        >>> np.ones(2, dtype=bool) == pytest.approx(np.asarray([True, True]))\r\n        True\r\n    \r\nholds with both pytest 8.3.3 and 8.3.4.\r\n    \r\nSo this commit basically goes through and updates the tests so that we use a ndarray for boolean arrays.\r\n    \r\nAn alternative would be to change from\r\n    \r\n        assert got == pytest.approx(expected)\r\n    \r\nto something like\r\n    \r\n        assert np.all(got == expected)\r\n    \r\nHowever, the error message when the array lengths are different or an element is different are a **lot less** useful, and the change would be even-more invasive than this change.\r\n\r\nI have also added a commit based on the work in #2198 to allow the macOS Intel runner to pass the tests (and bump the python version up to something more up to date).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherpa/sherpa/issues/2203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherpa/sherpa/issues/2203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
