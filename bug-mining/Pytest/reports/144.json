Given that `faulthandler` is a builtin since Python 3.3 and we no longer support Python < 3.5 seems like this would be very helpful for users to diagnose core dumps. \r\n\r\nIt is a small plugin (less than [70 lines of code](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler/blob/master/pytest_faulthandler.py)), and introduces two new options, `--no-faulthandler` and `--faulthandler-timeout`, with faulthandler being enabled by default for maximum usefulness. I've been using it in production for many years without problems.","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
