following hooks request a deprecated <code>py.path.local</code> parameter instead of the <code>pathlib.Path</code> parameter which replaced it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pytest_ignore_collect</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>collection_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_collect_file</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>file_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_pycollect_makemodule</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>module_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_header</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_collectionfinish</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.\nThe old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.</p>\n<p>See <code>legacy-path-hooks-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text

line arguments from a file using the prefix character <code>@</code>, like e.g.: <code>pytest @tests.txt</code>. The file must have one argument per line.</p>\n<p>See <code>Read arguments from file &lt;args-from-file&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#11523](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11523): <code>pytest.importorskip</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} will now issue a warning if the module could be found, but raised <code>ImportError</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} instead of <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}.</p>\n<p>The warning can be suppressed by passing <code>exc_type=ImportError</code> to <code>pytest.importorskip</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}.</p>\n<p>See <code>import-or-skip-import-error</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[#11728](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11728): For <code>unittest</code>-based tests, exceptions during class cleanup (as raised by functions registered with <code>TestCase.addClassCleanup &lt;unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;meth&quot;}) are now reported instead of silently failing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[#11777](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11777): Text is no longer truncated in the <code>short test summary info</code> section when <code>-vv</code> is given.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[#12112](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12112): Improved namespace packages detection when <code>consider_namespace_packages</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;confval&quot;} is enabled, covering more situations (like editable installs).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[#9502](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9502): Added <code>PYTEST_VERSION</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;envvar&quot;} environment variable which is defined at the start of the pytest session and undefined afterwards. It contains the value of <code>pytest.**version**</code>, and among other things can be used to easily check if code is running from within a pytest run.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#12065](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12065): Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where test classes containing <code>setup_method</code> and tests using <code>@staticmethod</code> or <code>@classmethod</code> would crash with <code>AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'setup_method'</code>.</p>\n<p>Now the <code>request.instance &lt;pytest.FixtureRequest.instance&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;attr&quot;} attribute of tests using <code>@staticmethod</code> and <code>@classmethod</code> is no longer <code>None</code>, but a fresh instance of the class, like in non-static methods.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
