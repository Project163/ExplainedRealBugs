point is the reason why I propose we don't do major changes: we have committed to port bug fixes to the 4.x maintenance branch until the end of the year. This is a commitment that we maintainers have to address.\r\n\r\nTo that end, we will have to:\r\n\r\n1. For each bug-fix submitted by a core maintainer, it would also be required another PR to the 4.x maintenance branch by the same core maintainer, as a general rule.\r\n\r\n1. For bug-fixes from external contributors, one of the core maintainers has to step up (probably we should assign this in a round robin fashion) to port the same bug fix to the 4.x maintenance branch.\r\n\r\nSo this maintenance process will be that much harder if we go \"all-in\" Python 3, as this will make just cherry-picking a change into the maintenance branch impossible; gradual changes might allow us to cherry-pick and solve an eventual conflict more easily.\r\n\r\nAs @RonnyPfannschmidt mentions, if we go all-in with Python 3, we need a clear commitment from the core maintainers about ensuring the workflow above happens.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nWe can discuss a slight change of plans as well.\r\n\r\n1. We keep Python 2/3 support until the end of the year. This has the advantage of not introducing additional maintenance burdens to us, but will prevent us from using Python 3 features in the code base until then. This is a bummer of course, I also would like to use Python 3 only as much as the next guy.\r\n\r\n1. We drop Python 2 completely now, and only keep a 4.x maintenance branch in case users want to back port critical bug-fixes themselves. This was the option I wanted in the first place when we started this discussion, but now it is too late as we've committed support for Python 2 until the end of the year for our users. I only mention this in passing, I don't think we can do this anymore at this point.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/493433196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2349192731,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM0OTE5MjczMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/2349192731","actor":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-17T12:19:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2349192732,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNDkxOTI3MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/2349192732","actor":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-17T12:19:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/493482268","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5275#issuecomment-493482268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5275","id":493482268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzQ4MjI2OA==","user":{"login":"blueyed","id":9766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed","html_url":"https://github.com/blueyed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url"
