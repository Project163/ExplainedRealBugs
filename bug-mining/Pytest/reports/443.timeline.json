to be safe I did some additional research, https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/ defines venvs and states \"Thus, a Python virtual environment in its simplest form would consist of nothing more than a copy or symlink of the Python binary accompanied by a pyvenv.cfg file and a site-packages directory.\". So it's safe to assume that every venv following the spec will contain a pyvenv.cfg.\r\n\r\nFor the external virtualenv package pyvenv.cfg was added in v20, released 4+ years ago, which is also in Ubuntu 20.04 for example.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is fine.\r\n\r\nI also had a look at the code already, so I'm happy to review if wanted.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2197186689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lazka","id":991986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTk4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/991986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka","html_url":"https://github.com/lazka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"zachsnicker","id":174099534,"node_id":"U_kgDOCmCMTg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/174099534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker","html_url":"https://github.com/zachsnicker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachsnicker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-28T16:40:13Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T16:40:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/12545","id":2380794829,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAjwLdc5z6WPq","number":12545,"title":"Support

for submitting an issue!\r\n\r\nQuick check-list while reporting bugs:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [X] a detailed description of the bug or problem you are having\r\n- [X] output of `pip list` from the virtual environment you are using\r\n   - NB: Before and after failing CI runs: https://www.diffchecker.com/SReU8wCR/ \r\n- [X] pytest and operating system versions\r\n   - 8.3.1, multiple different GitHub Actions runners (`windows-2019`, `ubuntu-2022`, etc.) \r\n- [X] minimal example if possible\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWe have the following `setup.cfg` file:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[tool:pytest]\r\naddopts = --verbose --show-capture=stderr --tb=native\r\npython_files = testing/**/test_*.py\r\n# NB: norecursedirs is *not* set\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running `pytest` (with no additional options) in the [root of our repository](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox), we see the following behavior:\r\n\r\n- `pytest==8.2.2`: Only our tests are collected.\r\n- `pytest==8.3.1`: Our tests _and_ the tests of our dependencies are collected, leading to many errors.\r\n    - `collecting ... collected 367457 items / 408 errors / 100 skipped` (Woof!) \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nChanging our `setup.cfg` to the following didn't fix the problem either:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[tool:pytest]\r\naddopts = --verbose --show-capture=stderr --tb=native\r\ntestpaths = testing\r\npython_files = test_*.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix I used was adding `norecursedirs = {name_of_venv}`\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSince this involves collection in virtual environments, the reason for the regression might be related to changes in:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/12545\r\n\r\nNotably, we use a `conda` env with `pip` packages installed inside, which may subvert the expectations of the changes in the above PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13699941824,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc6N1hUwzwAAAAMwlIXA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/13699941824","actor":{"login":"Glyphack","id":20788334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzg4MzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20788334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack","html_url":"https://github.com/Glyphack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glyphack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2819b4da924901efd2d2bfdd0445e28877f7be2d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Glyphack/pytest/commits/2819b4da924901efd2d2bfdd0445e28877f7be2d","created_at":"2024-07-30T18:37:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
