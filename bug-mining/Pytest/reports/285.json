Up until now we have this configured via pytest.ini like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[pytest]\r\npython_paths = ./utils/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis definition appears to be getting ignored after upgrading to pytest 7.0.0, which then gives us 'module not found' errors on tests trying to import utils. Reading around, it looks like this functionality is now built in to pytest and so is pytest-pythonpath obsolete?\r\n\r\nI can get our tests passing again by updating to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[pytest]\r\npythonpath = ./utils/\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the main question is, is this change in behaviour expected? Has the old method been deliberately disabled or should I raise a bug?\r\n</div>","closed_by":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9636/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
