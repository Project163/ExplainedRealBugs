have a situation where I have two teardown fixtures:\n- one raises exception\n- second performs `pytest.exit()` - I use it to stop testing session when only specific test fails. \n \nSimplified example:\n\n```py\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef failing_teardown():\n    yield\n    raise IOError(\"Exception in teardown\")\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef exit_session():\n    yield \n    pytest.exit(\"Forced exit\")\n\ndef test_1(): return\n\n@pytest.mark.usefixtures(\"failing_teardown\", \"exit_session\")\ndef test_failure(): return\n\ndef test_3(): return\n```\n\nMy expectation is that:\n- `test_1` passes\n- `test_2` call passes, teardown reports error (due to exception in `failing_teardown`) and test session finishes due to `pytest.exit()` in `exit_session` fixture\n- `test_3` is not executed\n\nBut the exception from _pytest.outcomes.Exit is only logged inside ExceptionGroup and **exit is not performed**:\n```sh\n$ pytest\n================================= test session
