Summary\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative to #1475 which separated out code examples as a prelude to testing them.\r\nRather than separating out all the included code examples, we test:\r\n\r\n* complete

directory\r\n\r\nIt partially addresses #1325 by testing the complete dataset definition examples.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this testing, most of the existing examples have been validated as working in this PR, and a few corrected in #1677.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to use an already existing package to do this. I [summarised several of these in #1475](https://github.com/opensafely-core/ehrql/pull/1475#issuecomment-1725419508). Unfortunately, most of them don't really do exactly what we want. So having our own approach, without adding extra dependencies, seems reasonable. **We could re-review these options in future and see if any do become more suitable.**\r\n\r\n# What gets tested\r\n\r\n## Code blocks labelled as `ehrql`\r\n\r\nIt tests ehrQL example code blocks that are marked with the `ehrql` syntax. This is a simple example:\r\n\r\n``````\r\n```ehrql\r\n…\r\n```\r\n``````\r\n\r\nThese code blocks still retain Python syntax highlighting. The only difference is that they get extracted and tested by the test suite.\r\n\r\n**This test code uses the extension that extracts these code blocks out. Therefore, if a code block displays correctly in the ehrQL documentation, it should also be tested.** Allowed code block syntax in our current documentation configuration goes beyond \"a line starting with three backticks\"; see the [SuperFences documentation](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/superfences/).\r\n\r\n## Python source dataset definitions\r\n\r\nFull dataset definitions in the `docs/` directory are tested.\r\n\r\n:warning: It is currently assumed that any `*.py` file in the `docs/` directory is a working dataset definition for now. We could establish a filename convention or comment marker in the file to indicate it should be tested.\r\n\r\n## What isn't tested\r\n\r\nThere are other code-related examples included in the ehrQL documentation that are not checked:\r\n\r\n* Sections or snippets of dataset definitions that are incomplete\r\n* The contents of datasets output from dataset definitions\r\n* Dataset definitions that deliberately fail\r\n* The tracebacks of failing dataset definitions \r\n* Python interactive console sessions\r\n* OpenSAFELY projects\r\n* Commands given at the terminal\r\n\r\n## How search and testing of examples works\r\n\r\nChecking is rudimentary and works as follows for inline dataset definition examples:\r\n\r\n1. The test code extracts code blocks from any `*.md` files in `docs/`.\r\n1. The ehrQL `generate_dataset` function is run against the code blocks. This uses random dummy data.\r\n1. We check there's some valid output CSV data that we can iterate through, without checking what the data is.\r\n\r\nBroadly, the same check takes place for the Python dataset definitions:\r\n\r\n1. The test code searches the documentation directory for `*.py` files.\r\n1. The ehrQL `generate_dataset` function is run against the code from each file. This uses random dummy data.\r\n1. We check there's some valid output CSV data that we can iterate through, without checking what the data is.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds that are used\r\n\r\n* `codelist_from_csv()` gets monkeypatched so we just return some arbitrary codelist codes, and the validation of codes is patched out. This could be improved by establishing a convention of column names in the documentation examples that are use to detect which test CSV codes should be used: for example, `codelist_from_csv(filename=\"my_file\", column=\"snomedct\")`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/opensafely-core/ehrql/issues/1648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/opensafely-core/ehrql/issues/1648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
