been deprecated in the 4.X\r\n    series and are now removed:\r\n\r\n    -   `Request.getfuncargvalue`: use `Request.getfixturevalue`\r\n        instead.\r\n    -   `pytest.raises` and `pytest.warns` no longer support strings as\r\n        the second argument.\r\n    -   `message` parameter of `pytest.raises`.\r\n    -   `pytest.raises`, `pytest.warns` and `ParameterSet.param` now use\r\n        native keyword-only syntax.

If you\r\n    do, please decode it to an `str` beforehand.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5564` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564`): New\r\n    `Config.invocation_args` attribute containing the unchanged\r\n    arguments passed to `pytest.main()`.\r\n-   \\`#5576` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576`): New\r\n    [NUMBER](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.html#using-doctest-options)\r\n    option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in\r\n    floating-point numbers.
