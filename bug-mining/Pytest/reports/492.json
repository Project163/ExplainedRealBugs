In fact, the current PR that fixes that issue will only cause similar issues between other types. I'm very surprised that such major behavioral change may be introduced as a bug fix in a patch release.....\n\nWhile I think it's wrong to make such change in a patch release, I do agree with using more exact comparison for boolean types. However, it seems over restricted when comparison using normal `==` produces `True`.\n\n```python\nIn [2]: 1 == pytest.approx(True)\nOut[2]: False\n\nIn [3]: 1.0 == pytest.approx(True)\nOut[3]: False\n\nIn [4]: 1.0 == True\nOut[4]: True\n\nIn [5]: 1 == True\nOut[5]: True\n```\n\nThis makes the behavior of `approx` a bit difficult to reason about. I doubt if anyone would be asking for a more restricted comparison by adding `approx`...","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13218/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
