With Python 3.14 the evaluation of annotations is deferred by default, so pytest shouldn't throw an error if a name is undefined. A similar result could previously be archived by adding `from __future__ import annotations`.\n\n```py\n# test.py\nimport pytest\n\n# from incompatible_dependency import X\n\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef some_obj() -> X:\n    ...\n\n\ndef test_func(some_obj) -> None:\n    assert True\n```\n\n```\npytest test.py\n```\n\n```py\ntest.py:8: in __annotate__\n    def some_obj() -> X:\n                      ^\nE   NameError: name 'X' is not defined\n```\n\nAs far as I'm aware, pytest doesn't care about annotations. A possible solution would be to add a compatibility layer to the `inspect.signature` call with `annotation_format=Format.STRING` as added argument.
