a) have pytestbot publish those regendoc executed branches to the pytest repo\r\n\r\nBy opening a PR you mean? Yeah that sounds like a plan. I was thinking this should be triggered by any merge to `master` or `features`. \r\n\r\nWe could have an app running somewhere that receives a merge event via webhooks, and then clones pytest/creates virtualenv/runs invoke regen/pushes a PR against the merged branch.\r\n\r\n@conda-forge has a bot running in Heroku which does similar things (they listen for specific comments like `@conda-forge-admin please rerender` and that triggers the rerendering process in a PR; the bot then pushes the new commits).\r\n\r\n> because pushing tags to a pr only really works when we do it on the main repo\r\n\r\nActually it works, I've done this a few times already: by pushing the tag, you also push the PR's commits to the main repository. 😉 \r\n\r\n> b) create a own pypi upload tool because @TravisCI pypi deploys are broken and incorrectly report success/failure since years now - basically travis cant be trusted with correct tooling there\r\n\r\nI see what you mean, but I would like to follow with just using Travis deploy tool for now; I understand it may fail to deploy and still pass, but the worst outcome of that (while annoying) is just having to make a upload manually. Having a new invoke task for that seems like a good addition, but shouldn't block the main proposal here IMHO.\r\n\r\nIn summary I definitely like your ideas (they actually match what I had in the back of my mind for some time as well), but would like to implement what I mention in the initial post soon because it will simplify our deployment process at a very low cost. Your other suggestions are definitely a nice follow
