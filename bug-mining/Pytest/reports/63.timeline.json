issues proper warnings for:\r\n\r\n* Compatible properties\r\n* `cached_setup`\r\n* Using special named objects to customize node objects during class creation.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #3616. It also supports a new type of changelog entry, \"deprecations\", so we can show `Deprecations` separated from `Removals`.\r\n\r\n@RonnyPfannschmidt are other features you remember of that we should issue deprecation warnings? Would love to add to them as well.\r\n\r\nAlso it follows that we should not merge #3898, as now we have a proper way to turn the warnings into errors in pytest-4.0, to effectively remove them in 4.1.
