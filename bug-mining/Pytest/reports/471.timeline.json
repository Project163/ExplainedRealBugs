with decimal.Decimal objects triggers a decimal.FloatOperation error when the ApproxDecimal object's __repr__ method is called (e.g., during print() or assertion formatting).\n\nThis happens because ApproxDecimal.__repr__ compares its Decimal tolerance with hardcoded float literals (like 1e-3, 1e3). When the decimal context traps FloatOperations (to maintain Decimal precision), these implicit float-Decimal comparisons raise an error.\n\nThis issue started with pytest version 8.4.0 and seems related to changes from [Issue #13010](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13010).\n\nPytest 8.4.0\nPython 3.13.2\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS\n\n```python\n# test_decimal_approx.py\nimport decimal\n\nimport pytest\n\ndecimal.getcontext().traps[decimal.FloatOperation] = True\n\n\ndef test_decimal_approx_repr_issue():\n    \"\"\"Reproduces the decimal.FloatOperation error from pytest.approx(Decimal)'s repr.\"\"\"\n    approx_obj = pytest.approx(decimal.Decimal(\"2.60\"))\n    print(f\"Attempting to represent pytest.approx(Decimal): {approx_obj}\")  # Triggers the bug\n    assert decimal.Decimal(\"2.600001\") == approx_obj\n\n\n# You can run this test with:\n# python -m pytest test_decimal_approx.py\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13530/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
