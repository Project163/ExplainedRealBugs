to c8792bd0800b8ffc536a6ce251f9eb3075b5f5fa (pr #11780).\r\n\r\nWe're talking about this reproduction:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass TestIt:\r\n    def setup_method(self): pass\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def test_1(): pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis brings up the question, what is `self` in the `setup_method` of a `staticmethod` (or `classmethod`)?\r\n\r\nThe expectation, as happens with e.g. unittest and regular methods, is that it's a fresh instance.\r\n\r\nHowever, pytest<=8.0 has a subtle bug: all of the static/classmethods use a shared instance. The two prints here are the same:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass TestIt:\r\n    def setup_method(self): print('\\nSETUP!', self)\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def test_1(): pass\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def test_2(cls): pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that fixing this preexisting bug will also fix the 8.1.0 crash, so I will look into it, though it probably won't be a simple fix, so I might instead restore the previous (problematic)

also fixes a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where `setup_method` crashes if the class has static or class method tests.\r\n\r\nIt is allowed to have a test class with static/class methods which request non-static/class method fixtures (including `setup_method` xunit-fixture). I take it as a given that we need to support this somewhat odd scenario (stdlib unittest also supports it).\r\n\r\nThis raises a question -- when a staticmethod test requests a bound fixture, what is that fixture's `self`?\r\n\r\nstdlib unittest says - a fresh instance for the test.\r\n\r\nPreviously, pytest said - some instance that is shared by all static/class methods. This is definitely broken since it breaks test isolation.\r\n\r\nChange pytest to behave like stdlib unittest here.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means stopping to rely on `self.obj.__self__` to get to the instance from the test function's binding. This doesn't work because staticmethods are not bound to anything.\r\n\r\nInstead, keep the instance explicitly and use that.\r\n\r\nBTW, I think this will allow us to change `Class`'s fixture collection (`parsefactories`) to happen on the class itself instead of a class instance, allowing us to avoid one class instantiation. But needs more work.\r\n\r\nFixes

[pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) from 8.1.1 to 8.2.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from [pytest's releases](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/releases).</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>8.2.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.2.0 (2024-04-27)</h1>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#12069](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069): A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated <code>py.path.local</code> parameter instead of the <code>pathlib.Path</code> parameter which replaced it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pytest_ignore_collect</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>collection_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_collect_file</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>file_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_pycollect_makemodule</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>module_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_header</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_collectionfinish</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.\nThe old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.</p>\n<p>See <code>legacy-path-hooks-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#11871](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871): Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character <code>@</code>, like e.g.: <code>pytest @tests.txt</code>.
