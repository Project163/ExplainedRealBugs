If a parametrised package-scoped fixture is used in multiple modules within the same package, then instead of running the whole package with one fixture instantiation before switching to the next, it runs a module at a time, causing the fixture to be torn down and recreated each time.\r\n\r\n## MWE\r\n\r\n`conftest.py`:\r\n```python\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"package\",

it does correctly re-use the fixture across the whole package, so the issue seems to be related to sorting rather than re-use.\r\n\r\nChanging the scope to `session` gives sensible behaviour, so it seems to be specific to package scope.\r\n\r\n## System information\r\n\r\npip list:\r\n```\r\nPackage    Version\r\n---------- -------\r\niniconfig  2.0.0\r\npackaging  24.0\r\npip
