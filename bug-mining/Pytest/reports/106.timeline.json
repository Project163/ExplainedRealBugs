issue is a developer and community discussion on how strings should be handled in pytest.approx()\r\n\r\nTwo of the easiest ways to do text matching in pytest are:\r\n\r\n1. Regex Matching\r\n2. `assert \"abc\" in \"abcdef\"` \r\n\r\nI enjoy the benefits that using `assert` gives me because of its strength in pytest, but It's not as flexible as Regex could possibly be. \r\n\r\nA handy use case I could see is checking to see if an expected string is close to a \"template\"\r\n\r\n### psudo-code###\r\n```\r\ntemplate = \"You have saved {%} record\"\r\nreturned_string = \"You have saved 10 records\"\r\napprox(returned_string, template) -> true\r\n```\r\n\r\nperhaps there is a bounds of some sort\r\n\r\n```\r\ntemplate = \"You have saved {%} record\"\r\nreturned_string = \"You have saved 7 records\"\r\nbounds = [0, 10]\r\napprox(returned_string, template, bounds) -> true\r\n\r\nbounds = [0,5]\r\napprox(returned_string, template, bounds) -> false\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that a template/bounds combo seems to be a good way to extend string comparison beyond the `substring in string` model. \r\n\r\nI am very eager to think about other ideas or use cases people have 😄
