for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pull request was created to try and fix issue #6505\r\n\"error\" has been changed to \"errors\" without affecting the user-facing text.\r\nWhen testing the changes, there was one module that wouldn't pass (testing/test_junitxml.py).\r\nI've tried to look deeper into this and saw that when an xmlschema is created, there is an <error /> node created instead of <errors />. It looks like the \"s\" is being dropped from \"errors\" in the junit-10.xsd file which ends up in creating that node.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where to look further in order to fix the failed test cases. If you know which direction I should take in order to fix this I'd gladly move in that direction. @blueyed
