for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12888.\r\n\r\nSeems like having `readline` (or `rlcompleter`, which imports `readline`) imported at the root of the `pdb` module (as it is on 3.13) introduces the issue, but I'm not sure why. Perhaps the `libedit` backend tries to read something from stdin on startup?

pytest.\n\nThe problem can be reproduced like this:\n\n**conftest.py**\n``` python\ndef pytest_terminal_summary(config):\n\n    capture = config.pluginmanager.getplugin(\"capturemanager\")\n\n    capture.suspend_global_capture(in_=True)\n\n    print(\"Enter 'hi'\")\n    value = input()\n    print()\n    print(\"value:\",repr(value))\n    assert value == \"hi\"\n\n\n    capture.resume_global_capture()\n```\n\n**test_example.py**\n``` python\ndef example():\n    print(\"unimportant example\")\n```\n\nRunning pytest asks for \"hi\" but value will always be an empty string no matter what you type.\n\nBut it work when you use `pytest -s` and type \"hi\" or `echo hi | pytest`.\n\nI can only reproduce this problem using cpython 3.13, it worked for older versions.\n\n**uv pip list:**\n```\nPackage   Version\n--------- -------\niniconfig 2.0.0\npackaging 24.2\npluggy    1.5.0\npytest    8.3.4\n```\n\n**os:**
