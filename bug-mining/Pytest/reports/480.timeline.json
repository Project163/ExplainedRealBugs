for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [X] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [X] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [X] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [X] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdds an additional confval ``times`` to ``console_output_style``.\r\n\r\n## Design decisions\r\n\r\n### Duration format\r\n\r\nThe duration format should be as short, detailed and human readable as possible. It also needs to predictable in terms of character length to know how much space to allocate to the right in the console output.\r\n\r\nI landed on this:\r\n\r\n* 00:30:59.1236 -> ``30m 59s``\r\n* 00:00:10.1236 -> ``10.124s``\r\n* 00:00:09.1236 -> ``9.124s``\r\n* 00:00:00.1236 -> ``123.6ms``\r\n* 00:00:00.01236 -> ``12.36ms``\r\n\r\nThis maintains relatively high resolution for all duration lengths, keeps the string maximum 7 characters long (for durations below 100 hours) and is pleasant to look at.\r\n\r\n### Verbose vs non-verbose \r\nFor the non-verbose case I decided to sum up the durations for all tests per file to keep things as consistent with the other ``console_output_style``'s as possible. Additionally, teardown is currently only counted for the non-verbose case. \r\n\r\n## Example output\r\n\r\n### Non-verbose\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_bar.py ..........                                                  4.094ms\r\ntest_foo.py .....                                                       2.013ms\r\ntest_foobar.py .....                                                    1.837ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verbose\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[0] PASSED                                         320.8us\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[1] PASSED                                         260.9us\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[2] PASSED                                         236.9us\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[3] PASSED                                         234.2us\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[4] PASSED                                         241.9us\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[5] PASSED                                         230.3us\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[6] PASSED                                         230.7us\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[7] PASSED                                         248.6us\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[8] PASSED                                         245.6us\r\ntest_bar.py::test_bar[9] PASSED                                         231.0us\r\ntest_foo.py::test_foo[0] PASSED                                         269.7us\r\ntest_foo.py::test_foo[1] PASSED                                         250.6us\r\ntest_foo.py::test_foo[2] PASSED                                         241.2us\r\ntest_foo.py::test_foo[3] PASSED                                         243.0us\r\ntest_foo.py::test_foo[4] PASSED                                         242.3us\r\ntest_foobar.py::test_foobar[0] PASSED                                   236.1us\r\ntest_foobar.py::test_foobar[1] PASSED                                   253.7us\r\ntest_foobar.py::test_foobar[2] PASSED                                   264.8us\r\ntest_foobar.py::test_foobar[3] PASSED                                   246.1us\r\ntest_foobar.py::test_foobar[4] PASSED                                   243.9us\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses #13125 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2585285872","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13125#issuecomment-2585285872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13125","id":2585285872,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc6aGFTw","user":{"login":"afcmrp","id":22502768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTAyNzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22502768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp","html_url":"https://github.com/afcmrp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afcmrp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-11T14:26:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-11T14:26:39Z","body":"> This could be included in very verbose output\r\n> \r\n> This needs some tinkering for good ux\r\n> \r\n> Some devtools already show this in the test tree of their pytest integration\r\n\r\nGood input.
