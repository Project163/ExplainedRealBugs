checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ✅] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [✅] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix #13478\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a regression test to fix a bug in console_output_style=times that, because it lacks the duration attribute, caused a crash when a CollectReport object (from a skipped test) was included. The test helps stop future regressions and verifies that the problem no longer exists.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18419753783,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc65hgpAzwAAAARJ5yM3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/18419753783","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f87289c36c8dbe7740e3020f5546b6f8b0861ff0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/commits/f87289c36c8dbe7740e3020f5546b6f8b0861ff0","created_at":"2025-07-01T21:34:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18430678340,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc65hgpAzwAAAARKjdVE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/18430678340","actor":{"login":"kayhern","id":43411691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDExNjkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43411691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern","html_url":"https://github.com/kayhern","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhern/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c5a75f2498c86850c4ce13bcf10d56efc92394a4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fidelity-contributions/pytest-dev-pytest/commits/c5a75f2498c86850c4ce13bcf10d56efc92394a4","created_at":"2025-07-02T12:02:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18667708342,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc65hgpAzwAAAARYrp-2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/18667708342","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"275b7df74e3d41e1e8a9526dda66100df95e6af6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mergify-ci-insights/pytest/commits/275b7df74e3d41e1e8a9526dda66100df95e6af6","created_at":"2025-07-16T21:05:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3265896893","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13478#issuecomment-3265896893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13478","id":3265896893,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc7CqaG9","user":{"login":"j4784713-ops","id":231012774,"node_id":"U_kgDODcT5pg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/231012774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4784713-ops","html_url":"ht
