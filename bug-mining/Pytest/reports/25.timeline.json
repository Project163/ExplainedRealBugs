code responsible for writing the `pyc` files is this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/e012dbe346d724d91993068c6f5cb15423bb167e/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py#L341-L352\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the comment about Windows is not correct, there's no exclusive access guarantee and it is possible for concurrent processes/threads to write to a file at the same time and possibly corrupt it.\r\n\r\nThis short script demonstrates this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nimport tempfile\r\nimport threading\r\n\r\nwith tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:\r\n    filename = os.path.join(tmpdir, 'somefile.txt')\r\n    print(f'FILE: {filename}')\r\n\r\n    COUNT = 10\r\n\r\n    data = [1025 * 1024 * str(i) for i in range(COUNT)]\r\n\r\n\r\n    def write(i):\r\n        with open(filename, 'w') as f:\r\n            f.write(data[i])\r\n\r\n    threads = [threading.Thread(target=write, args=(i,)) for i in range(COUNT)]\r\n    for t in threads:\r\n        t.start()\r\n\r\n    for t in threads:\r\n        t.join()\r\n\r\n    print('DONE')\r\n    \r\n    with open(filename) as f:\r\n        read_data = set(f.read())\r\n\r\n    print(f'READ: {read_data}')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt spawns a number of threads, all of them writing different *data* to the same file. At the end, it counts how many different characters were written to the file.\r\n\r\nMost of the time the output is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFILE: C:\\Users\\Bruno\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpzzgwfa99\\somefile.txt\r\nDONE\r\nREAD: {'2'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut sometimes (2/9 on my machine) the file ends up corrupted:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFILE: C:\\Users\\Bruno\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpm0o7bpuq\\somefile.txt\r\nDONE\r\nREAD: {'8', '9'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior is consistent with the CI failures we have seen: corrupted `.pyc` files around 2-3% of the time.\r\n\r\nI searched for some solutions about the problem of atomically renaming a file on multiple platforms and the best library I found was [python-atomicwrites](https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites), which is small and does just this job.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/380614188/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1569749215,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1Njk3NDkyMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1569749215","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"749c634b0a06eee9a99f49dc9c10221db53fca49","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/749c634b0a06eee9a99f49dc9c10221db53fca49","created_at":"2018-04-11T22:54:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T22:55:48Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T22:55:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3390/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3390/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/3390","id":313515633,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTgxMDQ5NTE4","number":3390,"title":"Attempt
