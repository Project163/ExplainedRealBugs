#894: \r\n\r\n> The high level parameter submission logic is housed primarily in submit_reform. This is a complex function and does not have any unit tests. There are a fairly high number of paths that data can take through this function: File or GUI? Full calculation or quick calculation? Errors or no errors? If errors, were they detected in PolicyBrain or the upstream project? If errors, what type of errors and has the user seen them? On top of that, this function produces about 20 pieces of data.\r\n> \r\n> The aim for this first PR is to:\r\n> 1.  Move submit_reform into its own module. This makes the views.py module more pure in the sense that its functions map directly to web pages (i.e. a TaxBrain inputs page, an outputs page, an edit parameters page, etc.). This also modularizes the submission logic which will make it easier to apply to other apps in the future.\r\n> 2. Add tests to pin down the behavior of submit_reform so that it can be changed safely in the future.\r\n\r\nI am starting #894 with a clean slate given the extensive changes to code style and the `compute.py` architecture.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ospc-org/ospc.org/issues/923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ospc-org/ospc.org/issues/923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1788129977,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3ODgxMjk5Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1788129977","actor":{"login":"jezdez","id":1610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez","html_url":"https://github.com/jezdez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jezdez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"08c3397c61c25155d920c7e1d9cd9bf8c40de478","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/telemetry-analysis-service/commits/08c3397c61c25155d920c7e1d9cd9bf8c40de478","created_at":"2018-08-14T15:41:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1797566793,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3OTc1NjY3OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1797566793","actor":{"login":"cmccandless","id":7275238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzUyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccandless","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e319da2068e8f275e1d175b8a4fe23c6b1090495","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cmccandless/multisite/commits/e319da2068e8f275e1d175b8a4fe23c6b1090495","created_at":"2018-08-20T12:45:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1877744223,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4Nzc3NDQyMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1877744223","actor":{"login":"guykisel","id":6760519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NjA1MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6760519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel","html_url":"https://github.com/guykisel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fca36be21ed3900afd44cb9d5a88665edd08532d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guykisel/inline-plz/commits/fca36be21ed3900afd44cb9d5a88665edd08532d","created_at":"2018-10-01T20:30:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"remi-debette","id":33633677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjMzNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33633677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remi-debette","html_url":"https://github.com/remi-debette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remi-debette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remi-debette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remi-debette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remi-debette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","s

What's the problem this feature will solve?\r\nThe problem to be solved here is how to organize families of fixtures with pure metadata to avoid looking up fixture values from their names to determine if the fixture belongs to a given family or not.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a way that I can mark up a bunch of fixtures spread around a bunch of plugin and conftest files etc some of which are marked up with the simple standard markers `pytest.mark.metaFoo`. I wish to then lookup those marks from the `FixtureDef` instances retained in the fixture manager to do some dynamic container creations from these fixture families identified by their markers alone. I wish to do this family identification via markers because fixture naming convention alone is inadequate for my use case where looking up fixture values for those fixtures which match a naming convention can cause recursion loops for those fixtures that hold dependencies on the fixture I'm trying to dynamically populate with the fixtures of a given family but not others. This is where marker metadata would be a powerful differentiator.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd like to be able to decorate my fixtures with regular pytest markers as such (which is valid syntax today) but with that marker metadata able to be crawled and looked up from the `request` fixture object and ideally populated in the `FixtureDef` instances.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# plugin_1.py\r\nimport pytest\r\n@pytest.mark.fixA\r\n@pytest.mark.other\r\n@pytest.fixture\r\ndef fixture_foo():\r\n    return \"foo\"\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.fixB\r\n@pytest.fixture\r\ndef fixture_bar():\r\n    return \"bar\"\r\n\r\n\r\n# plugin_2.py\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.fixA\r\n@pytest.fixture\r\ndef fixture_2foo():\r\n    return \"2foo\"\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.fixB\r\n@pytest.fixture\r\ndef fixture_2bar():\r\n    return \"2bar\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the above I need a fixture that dynamically returns a container of the fixture values `[\"foo\", \"2foo\"]` just by discovering the fixtures in scope and contributing to that container the values of all fixtures which match the family criteria corresponding to the pytest markers I wish to filter upon.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Solutions\r\nSo far I've been leaning on a combination of fixture naming conventions and value lookups to get this organization by families accomplished but that will not work when I get to the complex case where the different fixture subfamilies share the same naming convention and thus become undifferentiable. In that scenario the fixtures are given different definitions from alternate plugins where I don't want them to continue to be selected by name anymore because the naming convention then blurs between two families of fixtures that have no way to be differentiated by name alone (hence the need for the markers to do the job).\r\n\r\nHere's the partial solution I've attempted so far that lets me organize fixtures by the naming convention pattern matching a suffix\r\n\r\n```py\r\n@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)\r\ndef fix_list(request):\r\n    print(\"fix_list\")\r\n    foo_fixtures = [request.getfixturevalue(fix_name) for fix_name in request._fixturemanager._arg2fixturedefs if fix_name.endswith(\"_foo\")]\r\n    return foo_fixtures\r\n```\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/77154959/1330381\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\nWhen I probe the fixture definition from a global scope I see that the fixtures have a `pytestmark` attribute, eg\r\n\r\n```\r\nfixture_foo.pytestmark\r\n[Mark(name='fixA', args=(), kwargs={}), Mark(name='other', args=(), kwargs={})]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't see how to navigate to that data from the `request` fixture. If there is an existing means today that would solve all my problems and I could mark up my fixtures today and solve some gnarly problems.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
