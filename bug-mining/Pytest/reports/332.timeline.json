ated_at":"2023-02-22T09:38:59Z","body":"Quick update: I think I fixed the bug by telling the AssertionRewrite to visit the NamedExpr expr and not by using the generic visitor.\r\nThat said, I got into another possible problem, because right now the error messages are not what we expect. Here is an example\r\n\r\n````\r\ndef test_walrus_conversion_fails():\r\n    a = \"Hello\"\r\n    assert a == (a := a.lower())\r\n````\r\nthis test fails correctly, but this is the message I've got\r\n\r\n````\r\n    def test_walrus_conversion_fails():\r\n        a = \"Hello\"\r\n>       assert a == (a := a.lower())\r\nE       AssertionError: assert 'hello' == 'hello'\r\nE           hello\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nand this is not what we expect, it's even worse! I'm trying to fix this behavior and I succeeded, but then this other test\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\ndef test_walrus_conversion_fails():\r\n    a = \"Hello\"\r\n    assert a != (a := a.lower())\r\n    assert a == 'hello'\r\n\r\n````\r\nfails with this message\r\n```\r\n>       assert a == 'hello'\r\nE       AssertionError: assert 'Hello' == 'hello'\r\nE         - hello\r\nE         ? ^\r\nE         + Hello\r\nE         ? ^\r\n\r\n```\r\n, because the solution I found does not remember that we change the variable value. \r\nAnother bit on this topic. It looks like there is something strange on how this thing works with mutable objects. For example\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef change_me(d: dict) -> dict:\r\n    d['change'] = True\r\n    return d\r\n        \r\ndef my_func(before, after):\r\n    return before == after\r\n            \r\ndef test_change_me():\r\n    a = {}\r\n    assert my_func(a, change_me(a))\r\n    assert a == {\"change\": True}\r\n```\r\nthis test has the same behavior in pytest and unittest, but it looks like the same pattern. In fact, there is a variable that is passed to a function with another argument that changes its value. \r\nTo me these two tests below\r\n\r\n`````\r\ndef change_me(d: dict) -> dict:\r\n    d['change'] = True\r\n    return d\r\n\r\ndef change_me_str(value: str) -> str:\r\n    return value.lower()\r\n        \r\ndef my_func(before, after):\r\n    return before == after\r\n\r\ndef test_walrus_conversion():\r\n    a = \"Hello\"\r\n    assert not my_func(a, a := change_me_str(a))\r\n    assert a == \"hello\"\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_change_me():\r\n    a = {}\r\n    assert my_func(a, change_me(a))\r\n    assert a == {\"change\": True}\r\n````\r\n\r\nshould behave the same, but in the first case (with the walrus operator) the change is not applied until the function is executed. \r\nOk that strings are immutable and dict aren't but it's very strange to understand and explain.
