is an interesting edge case you've stumbled upon.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\npytest's setups/teardowns are managed by the [`SetupState`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/047ba83dabe492af938104fe0058597f67a672be/src/_pytest/runner.py#L401) class.\r\n\r\nYou can see the docstring for how it works, but the important part here is that we're tearing down some `item` (test), we look at the next item (`nextitem`), see which fixtures the nextitem won't be needing, and tear them down in the context of `item`. In particular, the last item gets `nextitem = None` which tears down everything.\r\n\r\nWhen `--maxfail=N` is used (or `-x` which is alias for `--maxfail=1`), if the N failures are reached, the runner [sets `session.shouldfail = ...`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/047ba83dabe492af938104fe0058597f67a672be/src/_pytest/main.py#L547-L548C20), then the runner loop checks it and [exits the loop](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/047ba83dabe492af938104fe0058597f67a672be/src/_pytest/main.py#L355-L356).\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nLet's call the Nth failing test \"test N\" and assume there is at least one test after it, \"test N + 1\", which shares some higher-scoped fixtures.\r\n\r\n\"test N\" is torn down with `nextitem = test N + 1`, then `shouldfail` is set and the loop exits. But, all of the remaining fixtures weren't torn down because nothing told them to.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, pytest in a last ditch effort runs the remaining teardowns in a [`pytest_sessionfinish` hook](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/047ba83dabe492af938104fe0058597f67a672be/src/_pytest/runner.py#L106-L107). \r\n\r\nBut this `pytest_sessionfinish` hook currently is not written to handle exceptions, except for `pytest.exit`, even though it executes user code. So if one of the remaining teardowns raises, the exception just propagates.\r\n\r\n### Possible solution 1\r\n\r\nCatch the exceptions from the `pytest_sessionfinish` and issue some warning.\r\n\r\nThis would work, however then the teardown failures aren't reported in the context of any test. In particular they won't show in any xml reports and such.\r\n\r\n### Possible solution 2\r\n\r\nDetect when an item had set `shouldfail = True`, then instead of tearing it down with `nextitem = item N+1`, tear it down with `nextitem = None`.\r\n\r\nThis would work and run the teardowns in the context of the test, but is a bit dangerous - doesn't handle the case where plugins reset `shouldfail`. Also, I think there are other cases where we bail early, those would still need `pytest_sessionfinish` and the problem would still be possible there.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1858834273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1860762638","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11706#issuecomment-1860762638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11706","id":1860762638,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc5u6PwO","user":{"login":"bbrown1867","id":5721984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjE5ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5721984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867","html_url":"https://github.com/bbrown1867","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrown1867/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-18T15:09:02Z","updated_at":"2023-12-18T15:09:02Z","body":"Thanks for the detailed reply @bluetech! \r\n\r\nThe real pain point here is the lack of reporting - my team's observability tools consume `test-report.xml` and want all errors/failures to be reported such that we can triage them.

Detect when an item had set shouldfail = True, then instead of tearing it down with nextitem = item N+1, tear it down with nextitem = None.\r\n\r\nThis was pretty easy to implement, basically a one-line change in `pytest_runtest_teardown`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef pytest_runtest_teardown(item: Item, nextitem: Optional[Item]) -> None:\r\n    _update_current_test_var(item, \"teardown\")\r\n
