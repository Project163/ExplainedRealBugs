This will simplify our side because we won't need to change PytestDeprecationWarnings into errors anymore before each major release.\r\n\r\nIs this a major headache? Making things conditional on our own `__version__` might cause some headaches of its own...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW, [Django does](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/#deprecating-a-feature) something I like, which is embed the removal version in the warning type. This brings clarity to all involved, but might be getting too fancy.\r\n\r\nAdapted to pytest (as of version 6.1), this would be:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# Existing class\r\nclass PytestDeprecationWarning(PytestWarning, DeprecationWarning): ...\r\n\r\n# New class\r\nclass PytestExpiredDeprecationWarning(PytestWarning, DeprecationWarning): ...\r\n\r\n# New class\r\nclass

PytestRemovedInPytest8Warning(PytestPendingDeprecationWarning): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen pytest 7 is released, changes to\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass PytestRemovedInPytest7Warning(PytestExpiredDeprecationWarning): ...\r\n\r\nclass PytestRemovedInPytest8Warning(PytestDeprecationWarning): ...\r\n\r\nclass PytestRemovedInPytest9Warning(PytestPendingDeprecationWarning): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen pytest 7.1 is released, changes to\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass PytestRemovedInPytest8Warning(PytestDeprecationWarning): ...\r\n\r\nclass PytestRemovedInPytest9Warning(PytestPendingDeprecationWarning): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `PytestDeprecationWarning` should be used when adding deprecations right before a major release (when we had this case in pytest 6.0, we disabled them until after the release instead).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/678641297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/678693538","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7480#issuecomment-678693538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7480","id":678693538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODY5MzUzOA==","user":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-22T20:56:55Z","updated_at":"2020-08-22T20:56:55Z","body":"based
