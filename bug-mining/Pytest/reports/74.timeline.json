[test_tarfile](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/test/test_tarfile.py) to [backports.tarfile](/jaraco/backports.tarfile). When I run the tests, the setUpModule is never called.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the hook does seem to be honored in a minimized example.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n draft @ cat test_.py\r\ndef setUpModule():\r\n    print(setUpModule.__name__)\r\n\r\ndef tearDownModule():\r\n    print(tearDownModule.__name__)\r\n\r\ndef test():\r\n    print(test.__name__)\r\n\r\ndef test2():\r\n    print(test2.__name__)\r\n draft @ pip-run pytest -- -m pytest -s\r\n============================================================== test session starts ===============================================================\r\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.12.2, pytest-8.1.1, pluggy-1.4.0\r\nrootdir: /Users/jaraco/draft\r\ncollected 2 items                                                                                                                                \r\n\r\ntest_.py setUpModule\r\ntest\r\n.test2\r\n.tearDownModule\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================================================== 2 passed in 0.00s ================================================================\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand, I add the following to `conftest.py`, the setup/teardown methods are called:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pytest.fixture(scope='module', autouse=True)\r\ndef setup_and_teardown_module(request):\r\n    request.module.setUpModule()\r\n    try:\r\n        yield\r\n    finally:\r\n        request.module.tearDownModule()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it seems like that should be unnecessary if unittest's setUpMethod and tearDownMethod are supported.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
