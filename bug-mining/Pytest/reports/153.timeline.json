new version was just released of `pytest`, so [Doppins](https://doppins.com)\nhas upgraded your project's dependency ranges.\n\nMake sure that it doesn't break anything, and happy merging! :shipit:\n\n---\n### Upgraded pytest from `==3.2.3` to `==5.1.1`\n\n#### Changelog:\n\n#### Version 5.1.1\npytest 5.1.1 (2019-08-20)\n=========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n-   \\`#5751` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751`): Fixed\n    `TypeError` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.\n\n\n\n#### Version 5.1.0\npytest 5.1.0 (2019-08-15)\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nRemovals\r\n--------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5180` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180`): As per\r\n    our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X\r\n    series and are now removed:\r\n\r\n    -   `Request.getfuncargvalue`: use `Request.getfixturevalue`\r\n        instead.\r\n    -   `pytest.raises` and `pytest.warns` no longer support strings as\r\n        the second argument.\r\n    -   `message` parameter of `pytest.raises`.\r\n    -   `pytest.raises`, `pytest.warns` and `ParameterSet.param` now use\r\n        native keyword-only syntax. This might change the exception\r\n        message from previous versions, but they still raise `TypeError`\r\n        on unknown keyword arguments as before.\r\n    -   `pytest.config` global variable.\r\n    -   `tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp` method.\r\n    -   `pytest_logwarning` hook.\r\n    -   `RemovedInPytest4Warning` warning type.\r\n    -   `request` is now a reserved name for fixtures.\r\n\r\n    For more information consult [Deprecations and\r\n    Removals](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html) in\r\n    the docs.\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5565` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565`): Removed\r\n    unused support code for\r\n    [unittest2](https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/).\r\n\r\n    The `unittest2` backport module is no longer necessary since Python\r\n    3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also\r\n    doesn\\'t seem to be used: after removed, all tests still pass\r\n    unchanged.\r\n\r\n    Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before\r\n    removing any features or support for third party libraries, because\r\n    this code is apparently not used at all (even if `unittest2` is used\r\n    by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to remove it in\r\n    this release.\r\n\r\n    If you experience a regression because of this, please [file an\r\n    issue](`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new`).\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5615` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615`):\r\n    `pytest.fail`, `pytest.xfail` and `pytest.skip` no longer support\r\n    bytes for the message argument.\r\n\r\n    This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use\r\n    `\"message\"` instead of `u\"message\"`.\r\n\r\n    Python 3 code is unlikely to pass `bytes` to these functions. If you\r\n    do, please decode it to an `str` beforehand.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5564` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564`): New\r\n    `Config.invocation_args` attribute containing the unchanged\r\n    arguments passed to `pytest.main()`.\r\n-   \\`#5576` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576`): New\r\n    [NUMBER](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.html#using-doctest-options)\r\n    option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in\r\n    floating-point numbers. Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault\\'s\r\n    [numtest](https://github.com/boisgera/numtest) extension for\r\n    doctest.\r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5471` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471`): JUnit\r\n    XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5707` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707`): Time\r\n    taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable\r\n    representation when it takes over 60 seconds, for example:\r\n\r\n        ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====\r\n\r\nBug Fixes\r\n---------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#4344` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344`): Fix\r\n    RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with\r\n    \\\"\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py\\\" only.\r\n-   \\`#5115` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115`): Warnings\r\n    issued during `pytest_configure` are explicitly not treated as\r\n    errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely\r\n    breaks pytest.\r\n-   \\`#5477` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477`): The XML\r\n    file produced by `--junitxml` now correctly contain a `<testsuites>`\r\n    root element.\r\n-   \\`#5523` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523`): Fixed\r\n    using multiple short options together in the command-line (for\r\n    example `-vs`) in Python 3.8+.\r\n-   \\`#5524` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524`): Fix\r\n    issue where `tmp_path` and `tmpdir` would not remove directories\r\n    containing files marked as read-only, which could lead to pytest\r\n    crashing when executed a second time with the `--basetemp` option.\r\n-   \\`#5537` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537`): Replace\r\n    `importlib_metadata` backport with `importlib.metadata` from the\r\n    standard library on Python 3.8+.\r\n-   \\`#5578` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578`): Improve\r\n    type checking for some exception-raising functions (`pytest.xfail`,\r\n    `pytest.skip`, etc) so they provide better error messages when users\r\n    meant to use marks (for example ``@pytest`.xfail` instead of\r\n    ``@pytest`.mark.xfail`).\r\n-   \\`#5606` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606`): Fixed\r\n    internal error when test functions were patched with objects that\r\n    cannot be compared for truth values against others, like `numpy`\r\n    arrays.\r\n-   \\`#5634` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634`):\r\n    `pytest.exit` is now correctly handled in `unittest` cases. This\r\n    makes `unittest` cases handle `quit` from pytest\\'s pdb correctly.\r\n-   \\`#5650` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650`): Improved\r\n    output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.\r\n-   \\`#5701` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701`): Fix\r\n    collection of `staticmethod` objects defined with\r\n    `functools.partial`.\r\n-   \\`#5734` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734`): Skip\r\n    async generator test functions, and update the warning message to\r\n    refer to `async def` functions.\r\n\r\nImproved Documentation\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5669` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669`): Add\r\n    docstring for `Testdir.copy_example`.\r\n\r\nTrivial/Internal Changes\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5095` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095`): XML\r\n    files of the `xunit2` family are now validated against the schema by\r\n    pytest\\'s own test suite to avoid future regressions.\r\n-   \\`#5516` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516`): Cache\r\n    node splitting function which can improve collection performance in\r\n    very large test suites.\r\n-   \\`#5603` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603`):\r\n    Simplified internal `SafeRepr` class and removed some dead code.\r\n-   \\`#5664` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664`): When\r\n    invoking pytest\\'s own testsuite with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`,\r\n    the `test_xfail_handling` test no longer fails.\r\n-   \\`#5684` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684`): Replace\r\n    manual handling of `OSError.errno` in the codebase by new `OSError`\r\n    subclasses (`PermissionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, etc.).\r\n\n\n#### Version 5.0.1\npytest 5.0.1 (2019-07-04)\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nBug Fixes\r\n---------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5479` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479`): Improve\r\n    quoting in `raises` match failure message.\r\n-   \\`#5523` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523`): Fixed\r\n    using multiple short options together in the command-line (for\r\n    example `-vs`) in Python 3.8+.\r\n-   \\`#5547` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547`):\r\n    `--step-wise` now handles `xfail(strict=True)` markers properly.\r\n\r\nImproved Documentation\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n-   \\`#5517` (`https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517`): Improve\r\n
