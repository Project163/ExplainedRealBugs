pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/806), if you install packages like `pytest` or `Markdown` with `--require-hashes` you have to pin a specific version of `setuptools` as well, because it's included in their dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat requirements.txt\r\n#\r\n# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile\r\n# To update, run:\r\n#\r\n#    pip-compile

But the maintainers don't [currently have a failing test case or know what the conflict would be](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/522#issuecomment-376228119). It also appears that [setuptools was vendored by pip at some point](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1422), which might have changed the equation.\r\n\r\nCan anyone on the pip side clarify under what circumstances it might be safe or unsafe to pin setuptools, and thus what the correct behavior would be for `pip-compile --generate-hashes` in the linked bug? To promote the use of --require-hashes, it would be great to either narrow pip-compile's definition of \"unsafe\", or provide clearer instructions about how to handle the unsafety when needed.\r\n\r\nThe other two packages on [pip-compile's \"unsafe\" list](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/blob/9d0a91a382748a68f86d58a9e086b46a9b7c74f7/piptools/utils.py#L11) are `distribute` and `pip` itself, so I guess the same question applies to those as well -- are there any risks as far as `pip` is concerned to pinning them if necessary to satisfy `--require-hashes`?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/pip/issues/6459/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/pip/issues/6459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
