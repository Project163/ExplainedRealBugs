The output should be as human-readable, detailed and short as possible (or a good compromise between the three).\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable and how it solves the problem described above. -->\r\nFor most of my projects, progress/count have not provided useful information, but timings would have been. It's nice to keep track of execution times for tests to spot performance regressions etc early. Other users seem to have had the same need: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/discussions/8268\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Solutions\r\n<!-- Have you tried to workaround the problem using a pytest plugin or other tools? Or a different approach to solving this issue? Please elaborate here. -->\r\nI know that the flag ``--duration=0`` reports tests duration retroactively, but I would like to see it as soon as the test is finished.\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context, links, etc. about the feature here. -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
