Both pytest 7 and 8 reorder this version to have 5 setups/teardowns.\r\n\r\nI can't say why before 09b78737a5bde23eb488d5d6649bf966c5809176 the reordering *didn't* happen, and if this was intentional or accidental.

details of the change:\r\n\r\nBefore 09b78737a5bde23eb488d5d6649bf966c5809176, Metafunc will generate CallSpec's with separate `params` (indirect parametrizations, i.e. through fixtures) and `funcargs` (direct parametrizations), and the desugaring of direct to indirect (i.e.g `funcargs` to `params`) happened as a separate step after `pytest_generate_functions`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/7.4.4/src/_pytest/fixtures.py#L156.\r\n\r\nAfter 09b78737a5bde23eb488d5d6649bf966c5809176, Metafunc handles the desugaring itself, and there is no more `funcargs`.\r\n\r\nAll of this happens before `reorder_items` anyway, so why does it affect the item ordering? The difference is the `param_index` that the desugaring assigns to the (desguared) direct params. Before the code was this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/7.4.4/src/_pytest/fixtures.py#L168-L181\r\n\r\nThe important bit is `callspec.indices[argname] = len(arg2params_list)` - this basically assigns a fresh param index *across* all callspecs. This results in the following arg keys in `reorder_items`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n('proto', 0, <Function test[1-a]>)\r\n('proto', 1, <Function test[1-b]>)\r\n('proto', 2, <Function test[2-a]>)\r\n('proto', 3, <Function test[2-b]>)\r\n('unit',  0, <Function test[1-a]>)\r\n('unit',  1, <Function test[1-b]>)\r\n('unit',  2, <Function test[2-a]>)\r\n('unit',  3, <Function test[2-b]>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter, there is no special handling of the param indexes of direct params, they are handled same as parametrized fixtures. This results in the following arg keys:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n('proto', 0, <Function test[1-a]>)\r\n('proto', 0, <Function test[2-a]>)\r\n('proto', 1, <Function test[1-b]>)\r\n('proto', 1, <Function test[2-b]>)\r\n('unit',  0, <Function test[1-a]>)\r\n('unit',  0, <Function test[1-b]>)\r\n('unit',  1, <Function test[2-a]>)\r\n('unit',  1, <Function test[2-b]>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRephrasing the above in a way that may be clearer:\r\n\r\nBefore, indexes for direct params were assigned in a sequential manner per `argname` after all parametrizations are exploded, so we have a table of `argname`, `item` (= callspec) and we assign the param index:\r\n\r\n| argname | item | param index |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| proto | test[1-a] | 0 |\r\n| proto | test[1-b] | 1 |\r\n| proto | test[2-a] | 2 |\r\n| proto | test[2-b] | 3 |\r\n| unit | test[1-a] | 0 | \r\n| unit | test[1-b] | 1 | \r\n| unit | test[2-a] | 2 | \r\n| unit | test[2-b] | 3 | \r\n\r\nAfter, the param indexes are assigned as they would for the desugaring I gave above:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\n# param indexes:        0  1\r\n@pytest.fixture(params=[1, 2], scope='class')\r\ndef unit(request):\r\n    return request.param\r\n\r\n# param indexes:         0    1\r\n@pytest.fixture(params=['a', 'b'], scope='class')\r\ndef proto(request):\r\n    return request.param\r\n```","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1958890830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-22T08:00:36Z","updated_at":"2024-02-22T08:00:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12019","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12019/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12019/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12019/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/12019","id":2148454102,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAjwLdc5nnUMn","number":12019,"title":"fixtures:

"> @ShurikMen I wonder, is the example you gave realistic or do you use `indirect` params maybe? I'm mainly curious why you're setting `scope='class'` on your `parametrize`s when the parameters are simple values.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the simplest examples that are actually used in my projects. There are many examples with an even larger set of parameters including \"mixed\" scopes (class/function).\r\n\r\n> With `function` scope the ordering is as you expect.\r\n\r\nNot quite like that.
