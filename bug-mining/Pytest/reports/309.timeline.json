really accurate. If there is a PR for the given branch, the `pull_request` event will happen too (and will be processed unless GHA workflow is set up to ignore the branch name pattern, for example). This has nothing to do with the deployment key. The problems with non-propagating events are only there if you use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. Any other tokens will cause normal events to happen.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1270607316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"webknjaz","id":578543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/578543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz","html_url":"https://github.com/webknjaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7538247741,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAjwLdc5ChbwczwAAAAHBUIg9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/7538247741","actor":{"login":"webknjaz","id":578543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/578543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz","html_url":"https://github.com/webknjaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-06T19:55:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7538247752,"node_id":"SE_lADOAjwLdc5ChbwczwAAAAHBUIhI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/7538247752","actor":{"login":"webknjaz","id":578543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/578543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz","html_url":"https://github.com/webknjaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-06T19:55:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1270617933","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9554#issuecomment-1270617933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9554","id":1270617933,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc5LvBdN","user":{"login":"webknjaz","id":578543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/578543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz","html_url":"https://github.com/webknjaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-06T20:05:03Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T20:10:04Z","body":"@bluetech I looked at your PR #10346, and now I see why you've drawn this connection. This is because both PR creation and pushing to Git used the same token. I've done one clever thing in one of my projects — [the workflow first pushes an empty commit (push to a new branch happens), then a PR is created using a normal `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` (because there's a branch that exists, it's possible — but this doesn't cause any PR-related events); then, the proper commits are force-pushed to that branch using a deployment key](https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/blob/13bc5d1/.github/workflows/pip-tools.yml#L405-L465). And this time, both `push` and `pull_request` events happen because `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` is not in use.

triggered.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1270617933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"webknjaz","id":578543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/578543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz","html_url":"https://github.com/webknjaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7538313942,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAjwLdc5ChbwczwAAAAHBUYrW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/7538313942","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-06T20:05:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7538313947,"node_id":"SE_lADOAjwLdc5ChbwczwAAAAHBUYrb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/7538313947","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-06T20:05:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7546706663,"node_id":"CE_lADOAjwLdc5ChbwczwAAAAHB0Zrn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/7546706663","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-07T21:30:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1272119577","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/i
