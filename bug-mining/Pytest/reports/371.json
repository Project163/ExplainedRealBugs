Dating since the original issue (https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7337), there was quite a bit of debate about whether this was a good idea. \r\n\r\nPersonally, making something raise an exception not because it's an error, but simply because some users may get confused by it, feels somewhat inconsistent with other decisions made in Python. For example, these Python \"[gotchas](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas)\" _could_ raise exceptions, but don't, because sometimes you do actually mean to do these things -- as is the case with returning non-`None` from a test.\r\n\r\nI'd propose to (a) keep the warning, but leave it as a warning indefinitely (so `filterwarnings` can be used), and/or (b) add a config flag under the `pytest-warnings` section for `--allow-return-not-none`.","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10465/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10465/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
