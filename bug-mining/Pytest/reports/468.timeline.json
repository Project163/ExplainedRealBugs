#10839, or at least the parts that pytest can handle. It also fixes https://github.com/agronholm/anyio/issues/789\r\npytest-trio already failed sync tests that were marked with `pytest.mark.trio`, this will now make that check redundant and we instead mark the test as erroring.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we care to have a deprecation period for sync-test + autouse-async-fixture, while users may currently have test suites that pass they're very close to shooting themselves in the foot and they will be riddled with `RuntimeWarning: coroutine [...] was never awaited`\r\n\r\nI briefly tested the fix against pytest-asyncio, pytest-trio and anyio's pytest plugin in case any of them would cause false alarms with actual async tests, but as far as I can tell there were no problems. But maybe @agronholm or @seifertm would like to confirm.\r\n\r\nIf a sync test depends on a sync fixture which itself depends on an async fixture the error message is perhaps slightly confusing. It might be enough to simply name the async fixture in the error message though.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] write changelog entry\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in
