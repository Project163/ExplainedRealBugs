I tried searching through the issue reports but I may not have used the correct search terms so apologies if this has already been discussed.\r\n\r\nSummary: It is not clear whether a nodeid is relative to the current working directory or to the root dir.\r\n\r\nExample: Consider the following directory structure.\r\n```\r\npytest.ini\r\nham\r\n `--- tests\r\n       `--- test_spam.py\r\n```\r\nThe file `pytest.ini` is empty; it is only there to specify the rootdir. The file `ham/tests/test_spam.py` contains:\r\n```\r\ndef test_eggs():\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ndef test_cheese():\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\nWhen running `pytest -v` in the directory `ham/tests`, I obtain the following output:\r\n```\r\n=============================== test session starts ===============================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.9, pytest-7.3.2, pluggy-1.0.0 -- /home/jitse/mambaforge/envs/spytest/bin/python3.10\r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: /home/jitse/tmp/pytestex\r\nconfigfile: pytest.ini\r\ncollected 2 items                                                                 \r\n\r\ntest_spam.py::test_eggs PASSED                                              [ 50%]\r\ntest_spam.py::test_cheese PASSED                                            [100%]\r\n\r\n================================ 2 passed in 0.00s ================================\r\n```\r\nThis suggests that the nodeid of the first test is `test_spam.py::test_eggs`. According to your doc page [Usage and Invocations](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/usage.html), we can specify the nodeid to run a specific test, and indeed if we run `pytest test_spam.py::test_eggs` in the directory `ham/tests`, only the first test is run. This all suggests that nodeid is relative to the current working directory.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, your doc page [Configuration](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html#initialization-determining-rootdir-and-configfile) says \"each test is assigned a unique nodeid which is rooted at the rootdir\". If we add a file `conftest.py` containing:\r\n```\r\ndef pytest_itemcollected(item):\r\n    print(f'pytest_itemcollected: {item.nodeid=}')\r\n```\r\nand then run `pytest` in the `ham/tests` directory, we get the following output:\r\n```\r\n=============================== test session starts ===============================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.9, pytest-7.3.2, pluggy-1.0.0\r\nrootdir: /home/jitse/tmp/pytestex\r\nconfigfile: pytest.ini\r\ncollecting ... pytest_itemcollected: item.nodeid='ham/tests/test_spam.py::test_eggs'\r\npytest_itemcollected: item.nodeid='ham/tests/test_spam.py::test_cheese'\r\ncollected 2 items                                                                 \r\n\r\ntest_spam.py ..                                                             [100%]\r\n\r\n================================ 2 passed in 0.00s ================================\r\n```\r\nNote that the nodeid reported by the hook are relative to the rootdir, not the current working directory.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
