I'm missing start and stop timestamps to be able to correlate test results with external events.\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nTestReport objects should have .start and .stop attributes set, which can easily be copied from CallInfo objects in TestReport.from_item_and_call\r\n<!-- Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable and how it solves the problem described above. -->\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Solutions\r\n<!-- Have you tried to workaround the problem using a pytest plugin or other tools? Or a different approach to solving this issue? Please elaborate here. -->\r\nI considered adding it to pytest-reportlog here - https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog/pull/22, but we agreed that core pytest is a better place for such change.\r\n#### Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context, links, etc. about the feature here. -->\r\nInitial feature request in pytest-reportlog - https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog/issues/19","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
