dummy modules we introduce in `insert_missing_modules` (due to #7856 and #7859) \r\nwould cause problems if the dummy modules end up replacing modules \r\nwhich could be imported normally because they are available in `PYTHONPATH`.\r\n\r\nNow we attempt to first import the module via normal mechanisms, and only\r\nintroduce the dummy modules if the intermediary modules don't actually exist.\r\n\r\nClose #9645\r\n\r\n---\r\nOriginal PR text, when opened as a draft, for reference:\r\n\r\nI spent some time investigating this and narrowed it down to this function:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/c01a5c177b7bcabc0fbfc1d80b4c841088f8d14b/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L595-L612\r\n\r\nwhich is called during `import_path` when `importmode=importlib`.\r\n\r\nThe function was introduced because of #7856 and #7859, and it did feel like a hack at the time, but since everything seemed to work fine, it was merged in.\r\n\r\nStepping into the debugger, I can see that the function is called with `\"tests.conftest\"`, with `\"test.conftest\"` already being in `sys.modules` by then, then it creates this empty/dummy module for `\"tests\"`.\r\n\r\nOK the reported error makes sense: we are telling `tests` is a plain module, it should be a package according to the message. \r\n\r\nI dig around a bit in the import lib resources, looking for the code which generated that error message (`\"is not a pacakge\"`) to understand what `importlib` looked for in a module to recognize it as a package, and found this code in the standard library:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# importlib/_bootstrap.py\r\ndef _find_and_load_unlocked(name, import_):\r\n    path = None\r\n    parent = name.rpartition('.')[0]\r\n    if

`__path__` attribute, so I went ahead and quickly hacked this together to see how it behaves:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nindex def5fa94b..c105c6948 100644\r\n--- a/src/_pytest/pathlib.py\r\n+++

first, and only if that fails we attempt generate the dummy intermediate modules?\r\n\r\nThe code in this PR follows that approach and works with the original issue and the rest of the test suite [^1], but I'm opening this as a draft to gather the opinion of people more knowledgeable of the import machinery (@asottile). \r\n\r\nIf this looks good enough, I will add tests and a changelog entry.\r\n\r\n[^1]: Except for one test but that's because we call `__import__` with an empty `sys.meta_path`, which raises a warning, this can easily be fixed by checking `sys.meta_path` first before calling `__import__`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6066647624,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc4qmMvOzwAAAAFpmbJI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/6066647624","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3a6b8ef2a30d429db68880a02e638865fb250b7a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/3a6b8ef2a30d429db68880a02e638865fb250b7a","created_at":"2022-02-14T12:32:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6066706970,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc4qmMvOzwAAAAFpmpoa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/6066706970","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"747b8372eabc8909aae411937c6b80536bb214c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/747b8372eabc8909aae411937c6b80536bb214c4","created_at":"2022-02-14T12:42:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6326311223,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc4qmMvOzwAAAAF5E9k3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/6326311223","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8c128a0e0ec702c7742c17fab9b7cbbea108426c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aragilar/pytest-info-collector/commits/8c128a0e0ec702c7742c17fab9b7cbbea108426c","created_at":"2022-03-29T12:44:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6326368876,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc4qmMvOzwAAAAF5FLps","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/6326368876","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/
