I like 3 with the option to use a list for it\n\nInteresting idea but I see a couple of downsides:\n\n- It makes it hard to set `strict = true` and then turn some specific `strict_foo = false`. The advantage of `strict = true` over an explicit list that it automatically enables new strict options when they are added. We can add syntax like `strict = [\"all\", \"-strict_foo\"]` but I think that's undesirable.\n\n- We won't have a `:confval:` reference for each option.\n\nTherefore I think separate options and a boolean strict, where the specific options override `strict`, is better.\n\nThe model I have is mypy which I think works pretty well. Users who want the \"automatically updating strict\" behavior use `strict`, those who don't set the specific options.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3418083776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3418086642","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823#issuecomment-3418086642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823","id":3418086642,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc7Lu9zy","user":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-18T09:15:45Z","updated_at":"2025-10-18T09:15:45Z","body":"BTW

well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13829/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20372886266,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc7STI3KzwAAAAS-UZL6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/20372886266","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"193a85d5b431fa1fb6acb23ff54be4741defbaf8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bluetech/pytest/commits/193a85d5b431fa1fb6acb23ff54be4741defbaf8","created_at":"2025-10-20T06:40:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20372886280,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc7STI3KzwAAAAS-UZMI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/20372886280","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7941c356f53f92efe8d7c7e75545719dddbbe989","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bluetech/pytest/commits/7941c356f53f92efe8d7c7e75545719dddbbe989","created_at":"2025-10-20T06:40:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3421546158","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823#issuecomment-3421546158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823","id":3421546158,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc7L8Kau","user":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-20T10:44:54Z","updated_at":"2025-10-20T10:44:54Z","body":"I

with option 3 as well (but see below). I think it works well because a) it's a loud failure (rather than a silent one), and b) it should be trivial to adjust (just replace it with `--strict-markers` in presumably 1-2 easily findable places) if someone still wants the old behavior.\n\nIndeed that should also enable `xfail_strict` IMHO.\n\nPossible option 4: Add `strict = true` as an ini option, and make `--strict` a re-deprecated (or possibly removed) alias for that. Main reasoning being that it doesn't make sense to want strictness for one single pytest run, this strikes me as something you'd typically set once for all runs (and if not, `-o strict=true` still works). However, I haven't really thought in detail about what would happen to `--strict-markers` and `--strict-config` in this scenario, and I suppose it would be good to be consistent between the three.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3422982167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3426795735","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823#issuecomment-3426795735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823","id":3426795735,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc7MQMDX","user":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-21T13:51:27Z","updated_at":"2025-10-21T13:51:27Z","body":"Replying to @The-Compiler's comment in https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13829#issuecomment-3423000008\n\n> If anything, IMHO we should have strict / strict_markers / strict_config / strict_xfail as ini options (see https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823#issuecomment-3422982167) rather than CLI flags, and then it makes sense to make the naming consistent. But if we go there, please let's do it in one step instead of doing the xfail_strict rename/alias in one release and the CLI -> INI move of the rest in another.\n\nMy plan is to do the following in one PR:\n- Make `xfail_strict` be an alias to `strict_xfail`.\n- Add the missing `strict_*` ini flags (`strict_config` and `strict_markers`), keep the CLI flags but de-emphasize them in the docs and document them as e.g. \"overrides the strict_markers option`.\n- Add `strict` ini option, keeping `--strict` as CLI version\n\n> If we end up with aliasing options, IMHO there's a discussion to be had whether to deprecate the old way. Yes, it causes churn, but so does having two ways to do the same thing (especially for newcomers which might see both in different tutorials, and then they also need to know about which pytest version they use, etc.).\n\nI can implement whatever we decide, my opinion is to leave `--strict-config`, `--strict-markers` and `--strict` alone for backward compatibility and not deprecate them, since I

started implementing `strict`. After a bit of fiddling, I think the best way is to make `--strict-markers`, `--strict-config` and `--strict` literally the same as e.g. `--override-ini strict_markers=true`. That would allow us to completely forget about the CLI flags in the code itself and it mostly does the right thing. I plan to do it with a custom argparse Action.\n\nAnother thing is implementing the ini option (e.g. `strict_markers`) fallback to `strict`. The problem is that `getini` always returns a default, so it's not possible to know if `strict_markers` was explicitly set. The two options I'm considering:\n\n1. Add a `default` parameter to `getini`. Most intuitive, but I'm afraid this will muddle the waters, with users using it over the `default` from the `addini` (or the default of the type).\n2. Add an `Config.hasini(name: str) -> bool` method.\n\nOf course I can do it by accessing private attributes but I'd like to avoid that to ensure that external plugins are able to do the same if needed.\n\nCurrently I think I'll go with 2, but let me know if you have thoughts.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3435488888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3435872142","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823#issuecomment-3435872142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823","id":3435872142,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc7Myz-O","user":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-23T09:08:54Z","updated_at":"2025-10-23T09:08:54Z","body":"hasini
