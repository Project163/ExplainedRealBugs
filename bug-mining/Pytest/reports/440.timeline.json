This is the check that is responsible for that:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    elif (\r\n        hasattr(expected, \"__getitem__\")\r\n        and isinstance(expected, Sized)\r\n        # Type ignored because the error is wrong -- not unreachable.\r\n        and not isinstance(expected, STRING_TYPES)  # type: ignore[unreachable]\r\n    ):\r\n        cls = ApproxSequenceLike\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen generating the detailed output the `MyVec3` is wrapped in a `ApproxScalar`. When doing the same with a list `[1,2,3]`, then it is transformed into `[ApproxScalar(1), ApproxScalar(2), ApproxScalar(3)]`. This happens in `python_api.py::_recursive_sequence_map`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    if isinstance(x, (list, tuple)):\r\n        seq_type = type(x)\r\n        return seq_type(_recursive_sequence_map(f, xi) for xi in x)\r\n    else:\r\n        return f(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis `isinstance(x, (list, tuple)` is much more narrow as `hasattr(expected, \"__getitem__\") and isinstance(expected, Sized) and not isinstance(expected, STRING_TYPES)` from above.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1884937841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thorink","id":1706821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDY4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1706821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink","html_url":"https://github.com/thorink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1884942588","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11797#issuecomment-1884942588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11797","id":1884942588,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc5wWfD8","user":{"login":"thorink","id":1706821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDY4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1706821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink","html_url":"https://github.com/thorink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-10T14:21:56Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T14:21:56Z","body":"Replacing `_recursive_sequence_map` with\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _recursive_sequence_map(f, x):\r\n    \"\"\"Recursively map a function over a sequence of arbitrary depth\"\"\"\r\n    if (\r\n        hasattr(x, \"__getitem__\")\r\n        and isinstance(x, Sized)\r\n        # Type ignored because the error is wrong -- not unreachable.\r\n        and not isinstance(x, STRING_TYPES)  # type: ignore[unreachable]\r\n    ):\r\n        if isinstance(x, (list, tuple)):\r\n            seq_type = type(x)\r\n        else:\r\n            seq_type = list\r\n        return seq_type(_recursive_sequence_map(f, xi) for xi in x)\r\n    else:\r\n        return f(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould result in\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def test_vec_approx():\r\n        assert MyVec3(0, 1, 2) == pytest.approx(MyVec3(1, 2, 3), abs=2)\r\n>       assert MyVec3(0, 1, 2) == pytest.approx(MyVec3(1, 2, 3), abs=0.5)\r\nE       assert <test_approx....x7f9c09e6ca60> == approx([1 ± 5... 3 ± 5.0e-01])\r\nE         comparison failed.
