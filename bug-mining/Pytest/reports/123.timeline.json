What do you think is the root cause of the error?

Since pytest 3.8 we now collect `__init__.py` files.\r\n\r\nThis part of the traceback:\r\n\r\n```\r\nself = <_pytest.config.PytestPluginManager object at 0x0000000002B84240>\r\nmod = <module

that `odl.util` is importing the `pytest_plugins.py` module into its namespace, which is triggering the error, because `pytest_plugins` is a [special
