collection.</li>\n<li>[#12300](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12300): Fixed handling of 'Function not implemented' error under squashfuse_ll, which is a different way to say that the mountpoint is read-only.</li>\n<li>[#12308](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12308): Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where the permissions of automatically-created

Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[#12333](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12333): pytest releases are now attested using the recent [Artifact

artifacts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>8.2.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.2.0 (2024-04-27)</h1>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#12069](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069): A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated <code>py.path.local</code> parameter instead of the <code>pathlib.Path</code> parameter which replaced it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pytest_ignore_collect</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>collection_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_collect_file</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>file_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_pycollect_makemodule</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>module_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_header</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_collectionfinish</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.\nThe old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.</p>\n<p>See <code>legacy-path-hooks-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#11871](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871): Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character <code>@</code>, like e.g.: <code>pytest @tests.txt</code>. The file must have one argument per line.</p>\n<p>See <code>Read arguments from file &lt;args-from-file&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Improvements</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
