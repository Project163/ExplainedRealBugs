Basic description\r\n\r\nI've ran into an issue with executing tests using relative paths on pytest versions after 5.0.1: there is   an `ImportMismatchError` when pytest attempts to import conftest.py.  This occurs only if the codebase is on a Windows mapped network drive.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked on MacOS or Linux, but I have a feeling this doesn't affect them because it would have been reported earlier.  (I searched open issues here and didn't find anything that this seems to duplicate - apologies if I overlooked something.)\r\n\r\nThis appears to be distinct from the issue reported in #5819, both by dint of the versions involved and the nature of the exceptions.\r\n\r\nOne thing I observe comparing the output from 5.1.2 (not working) and 5.0.1 (working) is the root dir:\r\n\r\n5.1.2: `rootdir: \\\\giant\\src\\git\\conftest-repro`\r\n5.0.1: `rootdir: K:\\p\\git\\conftest-repro`\r\n\r\n#### pip list output\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip list\r\nPackage            Version\r\n------------------ -------\r\natomicwrites       1.3.0\r\nattrs              19.1.0\r\ncolorama           0.4.1\r\nimportlib-metadata 0.20\r\nmore-itertools     7.2.0\r\npackaging          19.1\r\npip                19.1.1\r\npluggy             0.12.0\r\npy                 1.8.0\r\npyparsing          2.4.2\r\npytest             5.1.2\r\nsetuptools         41.0.1\r\nsix                1.12.0\r\nwcwidth            0.1.7\r\nwheel              0.33.4\r\nzipp               0.6.0\r\nWARNING: You are using pip version 19.1.1, however version 19.2.3 is available.\r\nYou should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Platform info\r\n\r\n```\r\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.7.3, pytest-5.1.2, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.12.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOS version: Windows Server 2012R2\r\n\r\nI've also reproduced this issue on 5.1.0.  However, it fails to reproduce on 4.6.2 and 5.0.1.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed description and repro info\r\n\r\nI've created the repo https://github.com/paul-ko/conftest-repro to reproduce this issue.  The structure of its Python code is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconftest-repro\r\n+ contestrepro\r\n  + test\r\n    - __init__.py\r\n    - conftest.py\r\n    - test_bar.py\r\n    - test_foo.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo set up for repro, do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo to a mapped network drive on Windows.\r\n2. Create a virtualenv (my practice is to run `virtualenv venv` from the base directory of the repo)\r\n3. Activate that virtualenv\r\n4. Install pytest (using the repo requirements.txt to install the latest, or pytest==x.x.x to install a specific version)\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this example, let's say you've cloned it to `K:\\p\\git\\conftest-repro`, which corresponds to the network drive `\\\\giant\\src\\git\\conftest-repro`.\r\n\r\nTo repro, simply run `pytest conftestrepro` from the base directory of the repository.\r\nYou should see an exception like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pytest conftestrepro\r\n============================= test session starts =============================\r\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.7.3, pytest-5.1.2, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.12.0\r\nrootdir: \\\\giant\\src\\git\\conftest-repro\r\ncollected 0 items / 1 errors\r\n\r\n=================================== ERRORS ====================================\r\n________________________ ERROR collecting test session ________________________\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\config\\__init__.py:440: in _importconftest\r\n    return self._conftestpath2mod[conftestpath]\r\nE   KeyError: local('\\\\\\\\giant\\\\src\\\\git\\\\conftest-repro\\\\conftestrepro\\\\test\\\\conftest.py')\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\config\\__init__.py:446: in _importconftest\r\n    mod = conftestpath.pyimport()\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\py\\_path\\local.py:721: in pyimport\r\n    raise self.ImportMismatchError(modname, modfile, self)\r\nE   py._path.local.LocalPath.ImportMismatchError: ('conftestrepro.test.conftest', 'k:\\\\p\\\\git\\\\conftest-repro\\\\conftestrepro\\\\test\\\\conftest.py', local('\\\\\\\\giant\\\\src\\\\git\\\\conftest-repro\\\\conftestrepro\\\\test\\\\conftest.py'))\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\py\\_path\\common.py:377: in visit\r\n    for x in Visitor(fil, rec, ignore, bf, sort).gen(self):\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\py\\_path\\common.py:418: in gen\r\n    dirs = self.optsort([p for p in entries\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\py\\_path\\common.py:419: in <listcomp>\r\n    if p.check(dir=1) and (rec is None or rec(p))])\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\main.py:606: in _recurse\r\n    ihook = self.gethookproxy(dirpath)\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\main.py:424: in gethookproxy\r\n    my_conftestmodules = pm._getconftestmodules(fspath)\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\config\\__init__.py:420: in _getconftestmodules\r\n    mod = self._importconftest(conftestpath)\r\nvenv\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\config\\__init__.py:454: in _importconftest\r\n    raise ConftestImportFailure(conftestpath, sys.exc_info())\r\nE   _pytest.config.ConftestImportFailure: (local('\\\\\\\\giant\\\\src\\\\git\\\\conftest-repro\\\\conftestrepro\\\\test\\\\conftest.py'), (<class 'py._path.local.LocalPath.ImportMismatc                  hError'>, ImportMismatchError('conftestrepro.test.conftest', 'k:\\\\p\\\\git\\\\conftest-repro\\\\conftestrepro\\\\test\\\\conftest.py', local('\\\\\\\\giant\\\\src\\\\git\\\\conftest-                  repro\\\\conftestrepro\\\\test\\\\conftest.py')), <traceback object at 0x00000019ABE00E88>))\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Specify an absolute path instead of a relative path.  This seems to work whether the absolute path is a UNC path or a path using the mapped drive letter.\r\n2. Move the repo to a non-network drive, if that's a viable option for you.\r\n3. Downgrade pytest to a pre-5.1.0 version.\r\n\r\nOmitting the path entirely bypasses this issue, but when I do that the custom argument declared in `conftest.py` is no longer usable.\r\n\r\nOutput running after downgrading to 5.0.1:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pytest conftestrepro\r\n============================= test session starts =============================\r\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.7.3, pytest-5.0.1, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.12.0\r\nrootdir: K:\\p\\git\\conftest-repro\r\ncollected 2 items\r\n\r\nconftestrepro\\test\\test_bar.py .

which leaks future commits that directly fix the issue:\n> <antml:parameter name=\"command\">cd /testbed && git log --oneline --all | grep -i \"bracket\\|parametrize\\|modpath\" | head -10</antml:parameter>\n\nThe results of which directly reveal the fix:\n```\n    Fix incorrect result of getmodpath method.\ndiff --git a/src/_pytest/python.py b/src/_pytest/python.py\nindex

Running command: cd /workspace/django__django__3.2 && \u001B[1m\u001B[91mgit log\u001B[0m --oneline --grep=\"31926\" -i\n\nIn another Qwen3-Coder trajectory, `Django__django-15572`, ([complete output here](https://gist.github.com/jacobkahn/5ffc328617b30ed570bdfa6a14804b2a)) where the model specifically finds the commit containing the fix: [62739b6e2630e37faa68a86a59fad135cc788cd7](https://github.com/django/django/pull/15572/commits)\n> Command `cd /workspace/django__django__4.1 && \u001B[1m\u001B[91mgit log\u001B[0m --oneline --grep=\"33628\" \u001B[92m--all\u001B[0m` executed with exit code 0.\n\nThere are other examples of leakage found in trajectories from GLM 4.5, Qwen3-Coder 30B (`20250805-openhands-Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct`), and other models.\n\nMitigation will be to properly remove future repository state and any artifacts that contain information the agent could use (reflogs, branches, origins, tags, and more):\n- remove origins (branch names can reveal information about fixes)\n- remove all branches `git log --all` can be used to query them, plus branches that are tracking a remote origin might contain information about future commits even after a `git reset --hard`\n- remove the reflog (`git reflog`) can leak future commit messages that could detail approaches for solutions\n\nThe team (@felixkreuk, @UniverseFly, @jlko, @2dot71mily and others) will add more details as to findings here and below. We're still assessing broader impact on evaluations and understanding trajectories for sources of leakage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SWE-bench/SWE-bench/issues/465/reactions","total_count":208,"+1":103,"-1":0,"laugh":52,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":21,"rocket":0,"eyes":32},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SWE-bench/SWE-bench/issues/465/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
