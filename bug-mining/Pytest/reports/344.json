Given it finds nothing, pytest will behave as if called from the command-line without any parameters, which makes it search recursively from the current directory looking for `python_files` to collect.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/739408b958f8e5a24de81e17e4cc2d4f34d93991/src/_pytest/config/__init__.py#L1382-L1384\r\n\r\nIf you create the `tests` directory, then pytest will correctly search in that directory only.\r\n\r\nI agree those 2 facts are surprising:\r\n\r\n1. The fact that `testpaths` is a glob. This is [documented](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#confval-testpaths) but easy to overlook, probably we should add a glob to the example there.\r\n2. pytest silently not finding anything, and then proceeding as usual.\r\n\r\nI don't think we can do anything more for 1, but for 2 seems like we should at least emit a warning if `testpaths` is defined but does not match anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11013/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
