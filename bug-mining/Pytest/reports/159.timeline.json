PR fixes serialization/deserialization of report objects, which fixes it for `pytest-xdist` (where #5786 originated).\r\n\r\n* Moved the contents of `BaseReport._to_json/_from_json` to free functions as they were getting quite large. More importantly, I refactored the code so it can be reused for chained exceptions.\r\n\r\n* Move `TWMock` class to a fixture so it can be more easily reused in other test modules. `test_code` was
