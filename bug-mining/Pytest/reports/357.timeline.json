pytest-devs!\r\n\r\nMy team needs this bug fix,\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10447\r\nbut it is not included in the newer releases after the PR merge (not in any of the release tags), \r\nso we had to downgrade to pytest<7.2.\r\n\r\nCould you tell me when it is going to be released?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10754774401,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc5VJHDpzwAAAAKBCNWB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/10754774401","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6596ba3c785dbb639d2b380558e94770c1e54b1e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/commits/6596ba3c785dbb639d2b380558e94770c1e54b1e","created_at":"2023-10-24T14:27:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10755408219,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc5VJHDpzwAAAAKBEoFb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/10755408219","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"44ad1c9811d2ebf540e601ea66b9bebf8ea82969","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/commits/44ad1c9811d2ebf540e601ea66b9bebf8ea82969","created_at":"2023-10-24T15:04:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
