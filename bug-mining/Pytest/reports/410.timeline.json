The previous cases were legitimately bad ideas, running tests from `/tmp`. But since it seems like a common issue, we probably should make it work.\r\n\r\nThe easiest thing is to simply ignore files/dirs which raise a permission error, however I don't like this because it may silently skip over files which are meant to be included and really have wrong perms.\r\n\r\nAnother easy option is to warn and ignore, but the people who report this probably don't want the noise.\r\n\r\nThe problem started happening in pytest 8 because of the `Session` collection changes. Previously `Session` would collect the initial files itself, and thus could filter out non-matching files early. Now `Session` only collects the initial `Directory`s and then does a \"matchnodes\" pass after the fact, which means some files now get `stat`'ed when they previously weren't.\r\n\r\nWith some effort we could probably go back to avoiding `stat`s on files that are going to get discarded anyway. However it is probably too big a change for 8.0.x so will only be fixed in a feature release.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1925923536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11696597465,"node_id":"LE_lADOAjwLdc591UvUzwAAAAK5K-nZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/11696597465","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-04T21:28:04Z","label":{"name":"type:

https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/385796ba494e7ae65d55892d4a358b371ac7a6b6, pytest sends all files in the current directory to every plugin's `pytest_collect_file` hook, even if you are only wanting to run/collect tests from one file.

If this new behavior of collecting every file, despite specifying your file filter is intentional, we can close this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA worse case is just:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsafety/\r\n  test_toyota.py\r\n  test.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere test.sh has a pytest command inside it with some extra setup:\r\n\r\n```\r\npytest -n auto test_*.py -k 'not Base'\r\n```\r\n\r\ncurrently, it will recursively run itself with `pytest-cpp` installed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11974/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11803455936,"node_id":"UE_lADOAjwLdc591UvUzwAAAAK_inHA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/11803455936","actor":{"login":"BenjaminSchubert","id":1672192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzIxOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1672192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminSchubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminSchubert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unsubscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-14T15:29:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1944086944","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11904#issuecomment-1944086944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11904","id":1944086944,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc5z4Gmg","user":{"login":"mrlifetime","id":13847735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODQ3NzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13847735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime","html_url":"https://github.com/mrlifetime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrlifetime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-14T15:39:53Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T15:39:53Z","body":"This is an issue for my org.\r\nWe deploy applications fully isolated, so they all ship with their own python deps, similar to venv.\r\nWe have a generic test tool that allows running pytest via `--pyargs`, however the collector now doesn't stay within the confines of the package and starts adding dirs starting from root which contains tons of files and folders that it isn't permissioned to look at.\r\n\r\nThe typical invocation would look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/root/packages/libexec/mypackage/bin/python -m pytest --pyargs myorg.myteam.mypackage\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith v8, looking at pytest debug file, this starts traversing /root first, encountering all sorts of things.

Describe the issue:\r\n\r\nI have installed Python in `/cluster/apps/nss/gcc-11.4.0/python/3.11.6/x86_64` and when running numpy.test() it tries to access the location `/cluster/apps/spack/__init__.py` for which it does not have permissions. Therefore the error\r\n\r\n`PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/cluster/apps/spack/__init__.py'`\r\n\r\nis triggered and the test suite fails before running a single test. I don't understand why numpy tries to access this location that is totally unrelated to the Python installation, instead of just running the tests.\r\n\r\n### Reproduce the code example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy\r\nnumpy.test(label=\"full\", verbose=2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error message:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n[sfux@eu-g9-046-3 ~]$ module list\r\n\r\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\r\n  1) StdEnv   2) gcc/11.4.0   3) openblas/0.3.20   4) python/3.11.6   5) eth_proxy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[sfux@eu-g9-046-3 ~]$ python\r\nPython 3.11.6 (main, Nov 20 2023, 11:45:55) [GCC 11.4.0] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import numpy\r\n>>> numpy.__version__\r\n'1.26.2'\r\n>>> numpy.test(label=\"full\", verbose=2)\r\n/cluster/apps/nss/gcc-11.4.0/python/3.11.6/x86_64/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/numpy/_pytesttester.py:144: DeprecationWarning:\r\n\r\n  `numpy.distutils` is deprecated since NumPy 1.23.0, as a result\r\n  of the deprecation of `distutils` itself.

JSON file has read-only access with pytest version higher than 7.4.4\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n  Upgrade pytest to version 8.0.0 or higher.\r\n  Run pytest with the command pytest <test_file.py> -T <json_file> where <json_file> has read-only access.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nPytest should be able to execute without encountering permission errors, even when the JSON file has read-only access, which is working with pytest version lower than equal to 7.4.4\r\n\r\nObservation:\r\nProviding an additional argument --rootdir='<non_empty_root_dir>' along with the pytest command resolves the permission error, even when the JSON file has read-only access.\r\n\r\npytest version : 8.0.2\r\n\r\n
