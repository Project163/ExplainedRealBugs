of #13774.\r\n\r\nThe previous fix was a minimal change to make the existing code at least consider fixtures overrides, and handles the common case (direct override chains), but still wasn't correct, as it didn't handle override chains involving an intermediary (not the overridden) fixture.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, the algorithm needs to change. Now instead of a simple breadth-first search, we do a depth-first search, which more closely simulates the runtime behavior, and allows us the to check the \"stack\" of fixtures so we can use the correct fixture index (depth in the override chain).\r\n\r\nThis is more expensive but should be OK.\r\n\r\nRefs https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13773.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20111076845,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc7O-8fZzwAAAASutq3t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/20111076845","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3f831e600ad1d4cfa35a928485de4659cdbe5a26","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bluetech/pytest/commits/3f831e600ad1d4cfa35a928485de4659cdbe5a26","created_at":"2025-10-06T10:06:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
