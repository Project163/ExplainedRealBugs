I've got a Q about typing fixtures that return callables, which might fit into the docs PR.\r\n\r\nGiven the example below, the typing should be `Callable[[str], str]` based on the internal function in the fixture.\r\n```python\r\n@pytest.fixture\r\ndef hello_world_fixture() -> Callable[[str], str]:\r\n    def _hello_world_func(input: str) -> str:\r\n        \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"\r\n        return \"hello \" + input\r\n\r\n    return _hello_world_func\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_hello_world(hello_world_fixture: Callable[[str], str]):\r\n    assert hello_world_fixture(\"world\") == \"hello world\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat's the recommended typing for fixtures returning more complex callables?\r\nShould it be typed as a Protocol, or should the implementation be using a class instance?\r\n```python\r\nclass HelloWorldProtocol(Protocol):\r\n    def __call__(self, input: str) -> str:\r\n        \"\"\"call docstring\"\"\"\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n\r\nclass HelloWorldFixture:\r\n    \"\"\"class docstring\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    def __call__(self, input: str) -> str:\r\n        \"\"\"call docstring\"\"\"\r\n        return \"hello \" + input\r\n````\r\n\r\nAware this is more useful for typing plugins than regular fixture use in projects.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2509806466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"daria-shaw","id":3807987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDc5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3807987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw","html_url":"https://github.com/daria-shaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2510203410","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12842#issuecomment-2510203410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12842","id":2510203410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc6VnqoS","user":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-01T18:43:43Z","updated_at":"2024-12-01T18:43:43Z","body":"@daara-s I don't think there's anything pytest specific there, the same applies to type annotating complex callables elsewhere.\n\nThe Python documentation [agrees with your `Protocol` example](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/callables.html#callback-protocols) and explains that in-depth. Personally that's also what I'd prefer, as it seems simpler than defining a callable class that doesn't do anything else.\n\nFor more complex fixtures, you might want to expose functionality via an utility class. This also has the benefit of usually being easier to understand for Python beginners over returning a nested function. Then I'd prefer having a more clear method name (say, `start`) rather than using `__call__` though.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2510203410/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15485043390,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAjwLdc6X5oK4zwAAAAOa-wK-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/15485043390","actor":{"login":"daria-shaw","id":3807987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDc5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3807987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw","html_url":"https://github.com/daria-shaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-01T18:43:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15485043394,"node_id":"SE_lADOAjwLdc6X5oK4zwAAAAOa-wLC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/15485043394","actor":{"login":"daria-shaw","id":3807987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDc5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3807987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw","html_url":"https://github.com/daria-shaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daria-shaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-01T18:43:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16522614662,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc6X5oK4zwAAAAPY0xeG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/16522614662","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"335327c7d9d2813613d799f9e45e9455f186bb38","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mwychung/pytest/commits/335327
