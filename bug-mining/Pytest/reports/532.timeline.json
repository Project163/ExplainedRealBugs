Cache the iterator evaluation. I made a very ugly hack below to cache on the mark itself to see if there are any issues (it seems to work, and doesn't break any tests), but needs a cleaner way.\n\n<details><summary>Hacky caching</summary>\n<p>\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/_pytest/python.py b/src/_pytest/python.py\nindex 3f9da0267..133eecc09 100644\n--- a/src/_pytest/python.py\n+++ b/src/_pytest/python.py\n@@ -111,7 +111,17 @@ def pytest_addoption(parser: Parser) -> None:\n \n def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc: Metafunc) -> None:\n     for marker in metafunc.definition.iter_markers(name=\"parametrize\"):\n-        metafunc.parametrize(*marker.args, **marker.kwargs, _param_mark=marker)\n+        if len(marker.args) >= 2:\n+            args = list(marker.args)\n+            if not hasattr(marker, \"_argvalues_cache\"):\n+                if not isinstance(args[1], Sequence):\n+                    args[1] = list(args[1])\n+                object.__setattr__(marker, \"_argvalues_cache\", args[1])\n+            else:\n+                args[1] = marker._argvalues_cache\n+        else:\n+            args = marker.args\n+        metafunc.parametrize(*args, **marker.kwargs, _param_mark=marker)\n```\n\n</p>\n</details> \n\nI find 2 tempting, it arguably was a mistake to allow iterators here. Interestingly there is an old issue #122 which discusses this and updated the `parametrize` marker doc to clarify only list and tuple are accepted (which we actually [never

would break stuff like `map` and `zip` (but not `range`).\n\nAny opinions/other ideas?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3352819130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3352879361","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13409#issuecomment-3352879361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13409","id":3352879361,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc7H2OEB","user":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-30T16:03:53Z","updated_at":"2025-09-30T16:03:53Z","body":"WDYT

the question is what type we should use.\n\nOne way would be `Iterable & ~Iterator`. Iterable because we need to iterate, and not Iterator because that means it would be exhausted on first iteration.\n\nBut I'm thinking we can use `Iterable & Sized`. Sized because parametrizations *should* have a finite size (correct me if I'm wrong), so it will reject infinite iterables, and it still rules out all of the bad stuff I can think of.\n\nA simpler ready made alternative would be `collections.abc.Collection` which is `Iterable & Sized & Container`. But I think `Container` (type implements `__contains__`) is unneeded, it will for example reject `itertools.repeat(\"foo\", 5)`.\n\nSo my suggestion is:\n- Add a `SizedIterable[T]` class which inherits from `Iterable[T]` and `Sized`, then use it in `Metafunc.parametrize` for the `argvalues` and `ids` parameters. This is an immediate deprecation in the typing level; alternatively we can add an overload with `@deprecated`, didn't try it but could be nice if it works.\n- At runtime, check isinstance `Iterable` and `Sized` and issue deprecation warning if not.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3484377414/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/3485162862","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13409#issuecomment-3485162862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13409","id":3485162862,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc7Pu11u","user":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-11-04T10:27:34Z","updated_at":"2025-11-04T10:27:34Z","body":"thanks
