refactors the Capture classes to be more flexible.\r\n\r\nThe new `--capture=tee-sys` (https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/6315)\r\nis rather a flag that could have been also done via `--capture-tee`, to\r\nlater also apply to `fd`.\r\n\r\nThis was inspired by looking at it from the point of adding a \"duplicate stderr\r\nto stdout\" mode (i.e. a single stream), which also is a new mode that can be\r\napplied to both the fd and sys method.\r\n\r\nTherefore this handles `--capture` now as a set of modes (split on dashes).\r\n\r\nThis does not change any behavior for now, but can be refactored more, and\r\nI might look into adding support for `tee-fd` then also.\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/6315#issuecomment-562232980\r\nRef: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4597\r\n\r\n*Question*: should there also be new fixtures for this, i.e. `capteesys`?\r\nThat would result in 4 new fixtures then though:\r\n\"capteefd\", \"capteefdbinary\", \"capteesys\", \"capteesysbinary\", and twice as much\r\nagain with \"single\" - i.e. it gets messy with `--fixtures` etc.\r\nSo for this it might make sense to have a fixture that only works as a flag\r\nthen (`captee`), so that you would request `capsys` and `captee`.\r\n\r\n/cc @csm10495
