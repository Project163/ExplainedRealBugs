Manually use our invoke tasks to run regendocs, changelog and push a PR with the changed contents (very similar to what we do today).\r\n2. After the PR is approved, we push a tag and Travis publishes the package automatically.\r\n\r\nNotably missing from the current approach is using `devpi` and testing the package manually (I have been using `devpi-cloud-tester`); I think today the tools are mature enough where this step is not necessary, plus we already test using `tox`, which ensures the package is working properly.\r\n\r\nFurther @jaraco and a few others use this approach successfully, which gives me further confidence.\r\n\r\nThis is not fully automated yet, but I believe is a step in that direction nonetheless.","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3060/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
