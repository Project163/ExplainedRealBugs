sneak through to production.\r\n\r\nWe've actually been working on https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12504 via [`trio.testing.RaisesGroup()`](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference-testing.html#exceptiongroup-helpers) (eg in https://github.com/python-trio/trio/pull/3145), with the goal of merging it into Pytest once the API has been shaken out a bit.  Maybe we could push people towards `RaisesGroup` if their annotation is more precise than `(Base)ExceptionGroup[Any / (Base)Exception]`, so there's a clean syntax that strict type-checkers allow but without leaving the implication that we're checking anything more precise than we actually are?

type of the return value being incomplete/unspecified on the stricter setting and there being no really good place to add it as you can't simply type-annotate the result of a context-manager.\n\nI do realize that is a quite narrow and specific concern though with annoying/ugly but fully functional workarounds so this is not really something pressing.\n\nLoose thought without thinking too deep

What's the problem this feature will solve?\n\n\nCode I'd like to write:\n\n```py\n        excinfo: pytest.ExceptionInfo[pebble.ExecError[str]]\n        with pytest.raises(pebble.ExecError[str]) as excinfo:\n            container.exec(['foo']).wait()\n        assert excinfo.value.exit_code == 10\n```\n\nI'd like to write this so that it type-checks cleanly.\n\nAlternatively, it could be:\n\n```py\n        with pytest.raises(pebble.ExecError[str]) as excinfo:\n            container.exec(['foo']).wait()\n        # excinfo if of correct type here\n        assert excinfo.value.exit_code == 10\n```\n\nToday, this fails with:\n\n```py\n  File \"/Users/runner/work/operator/operator/test/test_testing.py\", line 6405, in test_register_with_result\n    with pytest.raises(pebble.ExecError[str]) as excinfo:\n  File \"/Users/runner/work/operator/operator/.tox/py3.10-unit/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_pytest/raises.py\", line 284, in raises\n    return
