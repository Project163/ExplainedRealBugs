all. I think that as important as getting `PASSED` on our tests, it is important to get useful messages when the tests `FAIL`. That being said...\r\n\r\n#### What's the problem this feature will solve?\r\nWhile comparing numerical data with `pytest.approx`, I find the messages a bit hard to read when we are comparing big enough numpy arrays. Example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_bla():\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    a = np.linspace(0, 100, 20)\r\n    b = np.linspace(0, 100, 20)\r\n    a[10] += 0.5\r\n    assert a == pytest.approx(b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message:   \r\n```\r\n>       assert a == pytest.approx(b)\r\nE       assert array([  0.        ,   5.26315789,  10.52631579,  15.78947368,\\n        21.05263158,  26.31578947,  31.57894737,  36.84210526,\\n        42.10526316,  47.36842105,  53.13157895,  57.89473684,\\n        63.15789474,  68.42105263,  73.68421053,  78.94736842,\\n        84.21052632,  89.47368421,  94.73684211, 100.        ]) == approx([0.0 ± 1.0e-12, 5.2631578947368425 ± 5.3e-06, 10.526315789473685 ± 1.1e-05, 15.789473684210527 ± 1.6e-05, 21.05263157894737 ± 2.1e-05, 26.315789473684212 ± 2.6e-05, 31.578947368421055 ± 3.2e-05, 36.8421052631579 ± 3.7e-05, 42.10526315789474 ± 4.2e-05, 47.36842105263158 ± 4.7e-05, 52.631578947368425 ± 5.3e-05, 57.89473684210527 ± 5.8e-05, 63.15789473684211 ± 6.3e-05, 68.42105263157896 ± 6.8e-05, 73.6842105263158 ± 7.4e-05, 78.94736842105263 ± 7.9e-05, 84.21052631578948 ± 8.4e-05, 89.47368421052633 ± 8.9e-05, 94.73684210526316 ± 9.5e-05, 100.0 ± 1.0e-04])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the main example I want to solve, although I've implemented a solution for other cases.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWould be nice to have something like this:\r\n```\r\n>       assert a == pytest.approx(b)\r\nE       assert comparison failed for 1 values:\r\nE         Index | Obtained           | Expected                    \r\nE         (10,) | 53.131578947368425 | 52.631578947368425 ± 5.3e-05\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### ~Alternative~ Solutions\r\nI haven't tried any workaround. But I implemented a solution, using `pytest_assertrepr_compare`. It is in this gist: https://gist.github.com/tarcisiofischer/cab56a5eb65aaa03bdbb4d206f1d49f0\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```\r\n>       assert [1, 2, 3, 4] == pytest.approx([1, 3, 3, 5])\r\nE       assert comparison failed for 2 values:\r\nE         Index | Obtained | Expected   \r\nE         1     | 2        | 3 ± 3.0e-06\r\nE         3     | 4        | 5 ± 5.0e-06\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n>       assert 1.0 == pytest.approx(2.0)\r\nE       assert comparison failed\r\nE         Obtained: 1.0\r\nE         Expected: 2.0 ± 2.0e-06\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n>       assert {'a': 1, 'b': 3} == pytest.approx({'a': 1.7, 'b': 3})\r\nE       assert comparison failed for 1 values:\r\nE         Index | Obtained | Expected     \r\nE         a     | 1        | 1.7 ± 1.7e-06\r\n```\r\n\r\nA big one (sorry for the dump)\r\n```\r\n>       assert np.array([\r\n            [\r\n                [1.1987311, 12412342.3],\r\n                [3.214143244, 1423412423415.677]\r\n            ], [\r\n                [1, 2],\r\n                [3, 219371297321973]\r\n            ]\r\n        ]) == pytest.approx(\r\n            np.array([\r\n                [\r\n                    [1.12313, 12412342.3],\r\n                    [3.214143244, 534523542345.677]\r\n                ], [\r\n                    [1, 2],\r\n                    [3, 7]\r\n                ]\r\n            ])\r\n        )\r\nE       assert comparison failed for 3 values:\r\nE         Index     | Obtained          | Expected                  \r\nE         (0, 0, 0) | 1.1987311         | 1.12313 ± 1.1e-06         \r\nE         (0, 1, 1) | 1423412423415.677 | 534523542345.677 ± 5.3e+05\r\nE         (1, 1, 1) | 219371297321973.0 | 7.0 ± 7.0e-06\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\nJust to mention, I didn't find any similar issue, so I'm starting a new one. The following issue has similar title, but it is completely different: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6985\r\n\r\nPlease, let me know if you guys like my proposal, and feel free to suggest improvements - I'll be happy to hear ideas.\r\nAlso, feel free to disagree and close this proposal, so I will just move my code to my project's `conftest.py`
