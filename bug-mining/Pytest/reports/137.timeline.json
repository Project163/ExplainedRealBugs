indicates that using the `record_property` fixture leads Pytest to generate an XML file which is not compliant with some strict schemas.  We don't actually use this fixture, but we *do* hook our statistics data into the underlying data structure so it gets passed between xdist workers correctly.\r\n\r\npytest-dev/pytest#5205 proposes to add a fixture with a better way, but we don't need to use the fixture when we can hook into the underlying method directly (which has the advantage of working on earlier versions of Pytest too).\r\n\r\nSo, [in our pytest plugin](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/blob/master/hypothesis-python/src/hypothesis/extra/pytestplugin.py), I think we could replace the use of `user_properties` with `getattr(request.config, \"_xml\", None).add_global_property(name, value)` *if* the `_xml` attribute exists.  Needs some manual exploration and testing to confirm the idea is sound first, but why *not* add yet another path for statistics data?  \r\n\r\n(it will also need to be tested, for example, both with

compliance)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/1975/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/1975/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2334384060,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzMzQzODQwNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/2334384060","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"73bbff2b7459e2523973ac90dcbf15c3b4e1684a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/73bbff2b7459e2523973ac90dcbf15c3b4e1684a","created_at":"2019-05-10T22:45:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2334841081,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMzNDg0MTA4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/2334841081","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-11T16:27:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2662658170,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI2NjI2NTgxNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/2662658170","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"21dc9a28ec65e44a7d0254ef577fd7c5d62f5e41","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/duckinator/bork/commits/21dc9a28ec65e44a7d0254ef577fd7c5d62f5e41","created_at":"2019-09-25T18:13:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3832461777,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4MzI0NjE3Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/3832461777","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/use
