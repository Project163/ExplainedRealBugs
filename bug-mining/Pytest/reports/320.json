Anyway, I can tell from the header that `pytest` is using `C:\\` as a rootdir and generates `C:\\.pytest_cache`, which I would like to avoid.\r\n\r\nBy debugging `determine_setup`\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/bc4e70e0485a15654aa72658668056d091a4b5dc/src/_pytest/config/findpaths.py#L175-L218\r\n\r\nI have found that it is being called with the following parameters:\r\n```python\r\ninifile = None\r\nargs = ['C:\\\\Users\\\\bers\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\_MEI138802\\\\project']\r\nrootdir_cmd_arg = None\r\nrootdir = None\r\nconfig = <_pytest.config.Config object at 0x0000021A33D60490>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have no relevant config in the app bundle, so the function passes via\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/bc4e70e0485a15654aa72658668056d091a4b5dc/src/_pytest/config/findpaths.py#L205-L208\r\n\r\nwith\r\n```python\r\ncwd = WindowsPath('C:/Code/project')\r\nancestor = WindowsPath('C:/Users/bers/AppData/Local/Temp/_MEI138802/project')\r\n```\r\n\r\n`rootdir = get_common_ancestor([cwd, ancestor])` returns `WindowsPath('C:/')`, but the following check returns `false` as `os.path.splitdrive(str(rootdir))[1]` is `\"\\\\\"`, not `\"/\"`.
