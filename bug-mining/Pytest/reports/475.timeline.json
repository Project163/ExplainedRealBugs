[#11525](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11525)\r\n\r\nDuring the sprint we discussed fixing the above issue and thought maybe it's a better idea to add a better represenation to fixtures. To do this without patching the object more, this PR refactors fixtures to have a class with attributes.\r\nThe main rational behind that is:\r\n- Now we have a type for fixtures makes it easier to check for fixture types and no need to perform cast on objects. Removed monkey patching.\r\n- They are no longer functions that carry a class within them.\r\n- When you decorate a function with a fixture it's not possible to call it anymore. So it makes more sense for it to not be a function or method.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nPreviously we had:\r\n\r\n```\r\n===================================== short test summary info ======================================\r\nFAILED tmp31nzhe4b.py::test_something - assert fixt == 42\r\n======================================== 1 failed in 0.03s =========================================\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere fixt is a pytest fixture function that is not replaced by it's value(directly used)\r\n\r\nNow we print:\r\n\r\n```\r\n===================================== short test summary info ======================================\r\nFAILED tmp31nzhe4b.py::test_something - assert pytest_fixture(<function fixt at *>) == 42 \r\n======================================== 1 failed in 0.03s

Context\r\n* Fix the issue #817\r\n* **Code changes:**\r\n    * The `pytest_markers(item)` method in `utils.py` has been simplified - now only \"simple\" user-defined pytest markers are converted to allure tags. Built-in (reserved) markers (e.g. `skip`, `xfail`, etc.) are now ignored. The approach was taken from [allure-pytest-bdd](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-python/blob/04a96551d98a94a258e3137c62859abcf92ca845/allure-pytest-bdd/src/utils.py#L143) implementation\r\n\r\n* **Unit tests changes:**\r\n    * Existing tests in `tag_test.py` have been updated, new tests have been added for each built-in (reserved) marker to verify they are ignored\r\n    * Renamed both the update and the new tests to make their purpose clearer\r\n    * Removed `test_pytest_marker_with_kwargs_native_encoding` as a duplicate of `test_pytest_marker_with_kwargs_utf_encoding` - they looked identical\r\n    * Updated the affected test in `pytest_rerunfailures_test.py` accordingly\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n- [x] [Sign Allure CLA][cla]\r\n- [x] Provide unit tests\r\n\r\n[cla]: https://cla-assistant.io/accept/allure-framework/allure2\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allure-framework/allure-python/issues/862/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allure-framework/allure-python/issues/862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
