We achieve it by implementing the following:\r\n```\r\n@pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True, hookwrapper=True)\r\ndef pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):\r\n    result = (yield).get_result()\r\n    if call.when == \"call\" or (call.when == \"setup\" and call.excinfo is not None):\r\n        test_id = None\r\n        if callspec := getattr(item, \"callspec\", None):\r\n            test_id = callspec.id\r\n        test_details = dict(test_name=item.name, test_id=test_id, passed=result.passed)\r\n        if call.excinfo is not None:\r\n            test_details.update(dict(type=call.excinfo.type.__name__, reason=str(call.excinfo.value)))\r\n            logger.exception(\"Test failed\", extra=test_details, exc_info=call.excinfo.value)\r\n        else:\r\n            logger.info(\"Test Passed\", extra=test_details)\r\n```\r\nThen we execute pytest with terminal plugin disabled. The problem occurs upon assertion failures and currently our workaround is setting `config.option.verbose` during the the `pytest_configure` on our end.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9422/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
