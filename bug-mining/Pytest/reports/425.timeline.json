How about, we leave the styling of tracebacks to --tb and just have --xfail-tb be a boolean, and it just controls if they on or off?\r\n\r\nI agree, that was what I meant by this:\r\n\r\n>  if not, the first implementation can just enable tracebacks when --xfail-tb is passed, then later we can improve on that to allow the no/short/long option.\r\n\r\nI see you closed the PR, was that

for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [X] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [X] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [X] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [X] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis implements issue #12231, making xfail tracebacks optional. \r\nAdd `--xfail-tb` flag, which turns traceback output for XFAIL results.\r\n\r\n* If the `--xfail-tb` flag is not sent, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.\r\n* The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with `--tb`, and can be `auto|long|short|line|native|no`.\r\n* Note: Even if you have `--xfail-tb` set, you won't see them if `--tb=no`.\r\n\r\nSome history:\r\n\r\n* This is a behavior break, but brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior.\r\n* With this change, default `-rx`/ `-ra` behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks.\r\n* With pytest 8.0, `-rx` or `-ra` would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results.\r\n* This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.\r\n* This change detaches xfail tracebacks from `-rx`, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with `--xfail-tb`.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2089472527","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231#issuecomment-2089472527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231","id":2089472527,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc58itIP","user":{"login":"okken","id":1568356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1568356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken","html_url":"https://github.com/okken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-02T03:37:33Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T03:37:33Z","body":"Accidentally
