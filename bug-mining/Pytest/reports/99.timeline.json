Problem\r\nCurrently (see *pytest* versions below), method `LogCaptureHandler.clear()` removes all records from the handler, but it does not clear the collected text in it's `.stream`, leading to contradictory results:\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/07e768ab68ad44bdf2c441d0ba7524d646ffdbf8/_pytest/logging.py#L240-L244\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/07e768ab68ad44bdf2c441d0ba7524d646ffdbf8/_pytest/logging.py#L220-L224\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n```python\r\nimport logging\r\n\r\ndef test_caplog_clear(caplog):\r\n    rlog = logging.getLogger()\r\n\r\n    rlog.error(\"Hi there!\")\r\n    assert \"Hi there!\" in caplog.text\r\n\r\n    caplog.clear()\r\n    assert all(\"Hi there!\" not in r for r in caplog.records)\r\n    assert \"Hi there!\" not in caplog.text  # Fails!\r\n```\r\n## Suggestion\r\nOne can either add this line into `.clear()`:\r\n```python\r\nself.handler.stream = py.io.TextIO()\r\n```\r\nOR add this one, which will work also for clients holding handler's `stream` property:\r\n```python\r\nself.handler.stream.truncate(0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n```bash\r\npip list |grep pytest\r\npytest (3.4.2)\r\npytest-cov (2.5.1)\r\npytest-cover (3.0.0)\r\npytest-coverage (0.0)\r\npytest-mock (1.7.1)\r\npytest-runner

`request.cached_setup` and `Metafunc.addcall`.\r\n\r\nFix #4489, #3083\r\n\r\nA note: I had to remove some tests because `Metafunc.addcall` can combine arguments in multiple levels of `pytest_generate_tests` hooks, while `Metafunc.parametrize` specifically has a check against that. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def test_generate_plugin_and_module(self, testdir):\r\n        testdir.makeconftest(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n                assert \"arg1\" in metafunc.fixturenames\r\n                metafunc.addcall(id=\"world\", param=(2,100))\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        )\r\n        p = testdir.makepyfile(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n                metafunc.addcall(param=(1,1), id=\"hello\")\r\n\r\n            import pytest\r\n            @pytest.fixture\r\n            def arg1(request):\r\n                return request.param[0]\r\n            @pytest.fixture\r\n            def arg2(request):\r\n                return request.param[1]\r\n\r\n            class TestClass(object):\r\n                def test_myfunc(self, arg1, arg2):\r\n                    assert arg1 == arg2\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        )\r\n        result = testdir.runpytest(\"-v\", p, SHOW_PYTEST_WARNINGS_ARG)\r\n        result.stdout.fnmatch_lines(\r\n            [\r\n                \"*test_myfunc*hello*PASS*\",\r\n                \"*test_myfunc*world*FAIL*\",\r\n                \"*1 failed, 1 passed*\",\r\n            ]\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen converted to use `metafunc.parametrize`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def test_generate_plugin_and_module(self, testdir):\r\n        testdir.makeconftest(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n                assert \"arg1\" in metafunc.fixturenames\r\n                metafunc.parametrize('arg1, arg2', [(2, 100)], ids=[\"world\"])\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        )\r\n        p = testdir.makepyfile(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n                metafunc.parametrize('arg1, arg2', [(1, 1)], ids=[\"hello\"])    \r\n\r\n            class TestClass(object):\r\n                def test_myfunc(self, arg1, arg2):\r\n                    assert arg1 == arg2\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        )\r\n        result = testdir.runpytest(\"-v\", p, SHOW_PYTEST_WARNINGS_ARG)\r\n        result.stdout.fnmatch_lines(\r\n            [\r\n                \"*test_myfunc*hello*PASS*\",\r\n                \"*test_myfunc*world*FAIL*\",\r\n                \"*1 failed, 1 passed*\",\r\n            ]\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe get this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: duplicate 'arg1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is fine, as users who might still rely on `cached_setup`'s behavior would have
