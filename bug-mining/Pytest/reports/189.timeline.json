for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Target the `master` branch for bug fixes, documentation updates and trivial changes.\r\n- [ ] Target the `features` branch for new features, improvements, and removals/deprecations.\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\nHi, \r\n\r\nthat's my first PR, ref. issue #5712 \r\nThe purpose of this is to enforce that every argument used in `parametrize` is explicitly declared either by corresponding test function or via `indirect` list. The example of how this is intended to work is given in documentation (added few lines to *doc/en/example/parametrize.rst*)\r\nI target master branch because I consider it a small change/bugfix.
