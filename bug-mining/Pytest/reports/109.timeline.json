is extended from #1187.\n\nIn my case there is some surprising behaviour. If I run the test suite using `addopts` from `setup.cfg` then the tests are duplicated and detected twice. However if I run it using `addopts` from  `pytest.ini`, then the problem goes away, which is very strange.\n\nAfter using `--debug`, I can see that the arguments are actually duplicated when using `setup.cfg`;\n\n```\nargs=['-rw', '-vv', '--maxfail=1', '--cov=bottlecap.py', '--showlocals', '--doctest-modules',\n '--cov-report=term-missing', '--trace-config', '--debug', 'tests', '-rw', '-vv', '--maxfail=1', \n'--cov=bottlecap.py', '--showlocals', '--doctest-modules', '--cov-report=term-missing',\n '--trace-config', '--debug', 'tests']\n```\n\nThere are also issues with using `setup.cfg`, for example passing in `testpaths` results in an error;\n\n```\n$ python setup.py test\nrunning pytest\nerror: error in setup.cfg: command 'PyTest' has no such option 'testpaths'\n```\n\nThere is a [comment](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/567#issuecomment-168311890) by a maintainer usage of `setup.cfg` should be deprecated. All of the problems mentioned above seem to go away if I use `pytest.ini`, and there doesn't appear to be any clear advantage of trying to use `setup.cfg` for this.\n\nAnother option is to make `[pytest]` section of `setup.cfg` work exactly the same as if it was in `pytest.ini`, but I'm not sure how feasible that is. Alternatively, dropping support for that section in `setup.cfg` might be another option.\n\nThoughts @RonnyPfannschmidt / @nicoddemus
