\r\n\r\npytest 3.8.1 on ubuntu 18.04 introduced some breaking changes in my codebase. The following used to work with 3.8.0:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# conftest.py\r\n@pytest.fixture(scope='session')\r\ndef driver():\r\n    \"\"\"Selenium headless Chrome webdriver fixture.\"\"\"\r\n    # just Chrome for now\r\n    options = ChromeOptions()\r\n    options.headless = True\r\n    options.add_argument(\"--disable-dev-shm-usage\")\r\n    options.add_argument(\"--no-sandbox\")\r\n    driver = Chrome(options=options)\r\n\r\n    yield driver\r\n\r\n    # Quit the webdriver instance\r\n    driver.quit()\r\n\r\n@pytest.fixture\r\ndef browser(driver, request):\r\n    \"\"\"Fixture for browser that takes a screenshot on error.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    yield driver\r\n\r\n    _take_screenshot_if_test_failed(driver, request)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef _take_screenshot_if_test_failed(driver, request):\r\n    \"\"\"Take a screenshot if the test failed.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    if request.node.rep_call.failed:\r\n        # take screenshot\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n# test_file.py\r\ndef test_frontpage(live_server, browser):\r\n    \"\"\"Test retrieval of front page.\"\"\"\r\n    browser.get('<url>')\r\n\r\n    search_form = browser.find_element_by_css_selector('form[role=\"search\"]')\r\n    assert search_form.get_attribute(\"action\").endswith(\"intentional error\")\r\n```\r\nBy \"used to work\" I mean, if there was an error in the test case, a screenshot would be taken. \r\nIn particular `request.node.rep_call` is not an attribute on `Function` or `Session` anymore (at least that is what the interpreter is saying).\r\n\r\nNow the `_take_screenshot_if_test_failed(driver, request)` call is only executed at session teardown even if the `browser` fixture is function scoped. I probably don't understand how fixture scopes are supposed to work. How would I get back the ability to screenshot only for errors? \r\n\r\n`live_server` comes from `pytest-flask`\r\n\r\nThanks for clarifying things if this is not a bug!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4031/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1877744106,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4Nzc3NDQxMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1877744106","actor":{"login":"guykisel","id":6760519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NjA1MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6760519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel","html_url":"https://github.com/guykisel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykisel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fca36be21ed3900afd44cb9d5a88665edd08532d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guykisel/inline-plz/commits/fca36be21ed3900afd44cb9d5a88665edd08532d","created_at":"2018-10-01T20:30:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
