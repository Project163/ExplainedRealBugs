8.2.0\n\nreal\t0m32.409s\n...\n```\n\nThis looks somewhat familiar to https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9941, in that it seems to get stuck around this line when running with `PYTEST_DEBUG=1`:\n\n```\n...\n    early skip of rewriting module: sortedcontainers.sorteddict [assertion] # gets stuck here, next line doesn't print for ages\n    early skip of rewriting module: MY_DIR.MY_DMODULE [assertion]  # this comes after, not sure if it's my code that's the culprit\n```\n\nAny idea why this should be so slow?

tell.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13565/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18368790403,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc691mp3zwAAAARG3X-D","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/18368790403","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0294ea40e28801b782d8e86819d87f0f14cecbb8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/0294ea40e28801b782d8e86819d87f0f14cecbb8","created_at":"2025-06-28T13:57:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18368802463,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc691mp3zwAAAARG3a6f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/18368802463","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"450ab4e73dd259cb93c4604191cb94ebdcc7579f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/450ab4e73dd259cb93c4604191cb94ebdcc7579f","created_at":"2025-06-28T14:00:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18368806000,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc691mp3zwAAAARG3bxw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/18368806000","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eaeae9dcde17d16928542779f6d3de4229477095","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/eaeae9dcde17d16928542779f6d3de4229477095","created_at":"2025-06-28T14:01:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18368809295,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc691mp3zwAAAARG3clP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/18368809295","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/o
