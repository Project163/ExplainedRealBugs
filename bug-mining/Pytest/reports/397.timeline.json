iOS as a test and release target for NumPy.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE: 30 July 2025** This PR is almost ready for review. PR body reflects current status. \r\n\r\nIn an environment where:\r\n* Xcode and the iOS SDK is installed, with all licences accepted.\r\n* cibuildwheel 3.1.2 is installed\r\n* ninja is available on the path\r\n\r\nThis branch will build and test accelerated iOS device and simulator wheels:\r\n```\r\nCIBW_PLATFORM=ios CIBW_ENVIRONMENT=\"INSTALL_OPENBLAS=false RUNNER_OS=iOS IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=17.0\" cibuildwheel \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build will also work without the `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` definition, but with an unaccelerated version of blas (this is the analog of the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0` configuration, except that there isn't a pre-compiled openBLAS for iOS to fall back on).\r\n\r\nOther notable details of this PR:\r\n* The pytest version used for testing has been bumped to 8.4.1, to avoid [an issue with getuser() support on 3.13 that impacts iOS](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11874)\r\n* CI workflows have been added to build and test iOS. The workflow is modelled off the Emscripten workflow, and includes triggers for manual dispatch, and publication of nightly wheels to the Scientific Python Nightly package index.\r\n* iOS CI workflows *build* x86_64 iOS simulator wheels - but they aren't tested. Unfortunately, [GitHub is deprecating the `macos-13` runner starting September 1](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-11-upcoming-changes-to-macos-hosted-runners-macos-latest-migration-and-xcode-support-policy-updates/#macos-13-is-closing-down), and the `macos-13` runner is the last x86_64 runner available on GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nFWIW, macos-13 runner issue will also impact the workflows producing x86_64 *macOS* wheels. I don't know what (if any) decisions have been made about NumPy's support for macOS on x86_64, but adding new iOS workflows using macOS-13 a month or two before the runner is deprecated seemed ill-advised.

[x] Explore repository structure and understand the issue\n- [x] Verify that OSError fix is already in place (commit 14d370781)\n- [x] Verify that changelog entry was processed for pytest 8.3.0\n- [x] Add comprehensive test for OSError handling in get_user()\n- [x] Address review feedback: skip on non-Windows platforms and use direct values\n- [x] Run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n\n## Summary\n\nSuccessfully addressed the Python 3.13+/Windows tmpdir crash issue. The code fix was already present in the main branch (added in commit 14d370781 and released in pytest 8.3.0), but was missing comprehensive test coverage.\n\n**Changes Made:**\n- Added `test_get_user_handles_oserror()` in `testing/test_tmpdir.py`\n- Test skips on non-Windows platforms (follows existing pattern)\n- Test removes all four environment variables (LOGNAME, USER, LNAME, USERNAME) directly\n- This properly tests the Python 3.13+ behavior where OSError is raised when these vars are missing\n\n**Review Feedback Addressed:**\n- Updated test to skip on non-affected platforms using `@pytest.mark.skipif(not sys.platform.startswith(\"win\"), reason=\"win only\")`\n- Changed from mocking getpass.getuser() to directly removing environment variables using `monkeypatch.delenv()`\n- Removes all four env vars that Python 3.13's getpass.getuser() checks\n\n**Test Details:**\nThe test validates that when all username environment variables are removed on Windows, `get_user()` returns `None` instead of crashing. On Python 3.13+, this exercises the OSError handling path. On older Python versions, it may use fallback mechanisms but should still return None.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n\n----\n\n*This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n\n<issue_title>Pytest tmpdir crashes on Python 3.13+/Windows when no username env vars are set (getpass.getuser now raises OSError)</issue_title>\n<issue_description>Bug report generated by co-pilot EXCEPT me having to edit a bunch since it was confusing and too much blabbing:\n\n**Summary:** \nOn Python 3.13 and 3.14 (RC) under Windows, pytest fails early with `OSError: No username set in the environment` if none of LOGNAME, USER, LNAME, USERNAME are present. The failure originates in _pytest/tmpdir.get_user(), which only catches ImportError and KeyError, but Python 3.13 changed getpass.getuser() to raise OSError when no username can be derived. This was previously tolerated.\n\n**Environment:**\n- OS: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)\n- Python: 3.13.0 / 3.14.0rc3 (installed via uv python install 3.13 3.14)\n- Pytest: 7.4.3 (also reproduced with latest 7.x)\n - Invocation context: Subprocess without username env vars (custom runner; uv seems to sanitize environment)\n\n**Relevant Python change:** \nPer Python 3.13 getpass.py (getuser docstring): Behavior changed to consistently raise OSError when no environment user identifiers exist and pwd (Unix-only) is not available.\nObserved Error (truncated): OSError: No username set in the environment File .../Lib/getpass.py:236, in getuser raise OSError('No username set in the environment') from e\n\nPytest stack location: _in _pytest/tmpdir.py: get_user() calls getpass.getuser() without handling OSError.\n\n**Minimal Reproduction (Windows, Python 3.13+):**\nCreate a clean directory with a trivial test file: \n\n`echo \"def test_ok(): pass\" > test_sample.py`\n\nLaunch Python with some variables cleared:\n- LOGNAME, USER, LNAME, USERNAME all set to \"\"\n\nExecute:\n`python -c \"import os, subprocess; [os.environ.pop(v,None) for v in ['LOGNAME','USER','LNAME','USERNAME']]; import pytest; raise SystemExit(pytest.main(['-q']))\"`\n\n**Result:** \npytest crashes with OSError before collection finishes.\n\n```\n    def getuser():\n        \"\"\"Get the username from the environment or password database.\n\n        First try various environment variables, then the password\n        database.  This works on Windows as long as USERNAME is set.\n        Any failure to find a username raises OSError.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 3.13\n            Previously, various exceptions beyond just :exc:`OSError`\n            were raised.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        for name in ('LOGNAME', 'USER', 'LNAME', 'USERNAME'):\n            user = os.environ.get(name)\n            if user:\n                return user\n\n        try:\n>           import pwd\nE           ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pwd'\n\nC:\\Users\\shg\\AppData\\Roaming\\uv\\python\\cpython-3.13.5-windows-x86_64-none\\Lib\\getpass.py:172: ModuleNotFoundError\n\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\n\n    def getuser():\n        \"\"\"Get the username from the environment or password database.\n\n        First try various environment variables, then the password\n        database.  This works on Windows as long as USERNAME is set.\n        Any failure to find a username raises OSError.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 3.13\n            Previously, various exceptions beyond just :exc:`OSError`\n            were raised.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        for name in ('LOGNAME', 'USER', 'LNAME', 'USERNAME'):\n            user = os.environ.get(name)\n            if user:\n                return user\n\n        try:\n            import pwd\n            return pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())[0]\n        except (ImportError, KeyError) as e:\n>           raise OSError('No username set in the environment') from e\nE           OSError: No username set in the environment\n```\n\nActual: Session aborts with uncaught OSError.\n\n**Root Cause:** \nPython 3.13 tighten semantics: \ngetpass.getuser() now raises OSError when no identifier found. Pytest’s get_user only catches ImportError and KeyError: except (ImportError, KeyError): return None Missing OSError handling lets the exception propagate.\nProposed Fix: Expand exception clause to include OSError.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nRestores pre-3.13 resilient behavior.\n\nNarrow catch still specific to getpass failure modes; avoids masking unrelated errors.\nWorkaround (for users now): Set an env var before running pytest \n\ne.g. in conftest.py:\n```\nimport os\nif not any(os.environ.get(n) for n in ('LOGNAME','USER','LNAME','USERNAME')): os.environ['USERNAME'] = 'tester'\n```\n\nOr inject in tox.ini: [testenv] setenv = USERNAME = tester\n\n\n**Impact:** \nAny Windows/CI environment invoking pytest under Python 3.13+ without a username env var will fail until patched. Silent in earlier versions because getpass.getuser() returned a fallback or raised only ImportError/KeyError.\nRegression Risk: Low. Adding OSError aligns with documented new behavior. Does not affect normal environments where env vars are present.</issue_description>\n\n<agent_instructions>create the suggested minimal bugfix and accompany it with a minimal unittest and the requ...\n\n</details>\n\nFixes pytest-dev/pytest#13835\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13836/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
