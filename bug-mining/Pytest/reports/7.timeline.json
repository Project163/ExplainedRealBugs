a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.\nYou are currently using **3.2.5**. I have updated it to **3.3.0**\n\n\n\nThese links might come in handy:  <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest\">PyPI</a> | <a href=\"https://pyup.io/changelogs/pytest/\">Changelog</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues\">Repo</a> | <a href=\"http://pytest.org\">Homepage</a> \n\n\n\n### Changelog\n> \n>### 3.3.0\n\n>=========================\n\n>Deprecations and Removals\n>-------------------------\n\n>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions\n>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on\n>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we\n>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users\n>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the\n>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2236\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2236&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken\n>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal\n>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack\n>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it\n>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)\n\n>Features\n>--------\n\n>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``\n>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)\n\n>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available\n>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and\n>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``\n>  declarations on functions. (`2267\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)\n\n>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)\n\n>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The\n>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``\n>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)\n\n>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)\n\n>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.\n>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options\n>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using\n>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test\n>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).\n>  For more information, please see the `logging docs\n>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was\n>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog\n>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch\n>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the\n>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has\n>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the\n>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)\n\n>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)\n\n>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and\n>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from\n>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from\n>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)\n\n>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with\n>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Bug Fixes\n>---------\n\n>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.\n>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now\n>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)\n\n>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the\n>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new\n>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized\n>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an\n>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to\n>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its\n>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``\n>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and\n>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)\n\n>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being\n>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,\n>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation\n>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)\n\n>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from\n>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)\n\n>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which\n>  should not be rewritten. (`2939\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)\n\n>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Trivial/Internal Changes\n>------------------------\n\n>- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal\n>  structures to ease code maintainability.
