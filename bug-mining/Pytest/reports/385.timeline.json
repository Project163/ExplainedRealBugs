all,\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding this issue. Should **config.getini()** return \"None\" irrespective of the \"type\" provided for the configuration? What if the the \"type\" is linelist or pathlist with no default value or \"None\" provided in configuration or while making the call to **parser.addini()**\r\n\r\nPlease look at a test that exists in the current code base that implicitly assumes that the configuration item named \"xy\" has a default value of empty list. I think the correct way to call **parser.addini()** is to always provide a default value if you are expecting it to return an Empty List or any other data type. Which means the call to addini() in the test code below should be:\r\n\r\nparser.addini(\"xy\", \"\", type=\"linelist\", **default=[]**)\r\ninstead of just\r\nparser.addini(\"xy\", \"\", type=\"linelist\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n def test_addinivalue_line_new(self, pytester: Pytester) -> None:\r\n        pytester.makeconftest(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            def

you @RonnyPfannschmidt,\r\n\r\nBut my question was around the expected behavior after making changes for this issue. This issue as raised by @harmin-parra expects config.getini() to return \"None\" if \"None\" is set as the default value while adding the configuration item using parser.addini().\r\n\r\n**Solution 1**\r\nReturn \"None\" as the default value if \"None\" or no default value if provided by the developer. In this approach, existing calls to the config.getini() function would need to check for \"None\" values\r\n\r\n**Solution 2**\r\nReturn a default value based on the \"type\" argument. If no type argument is specified, then it will be treated as a string. But in this approach, \"None\" will never be returned as a default value.\r\n\r\n**Solution 3**\r\nThe default value can have an additional possible option of \"NotSet\" which would mean that the developer did not pass any value for the \"default\" parameter. This will be different from passing \"None\" as default. In this approach, the following behavior will be seen:\r\n\r\n1) If the developer sets \"None\" as the default value for the configuration, then \"None\" will be returned irrespective of the \"type\" parameter.\r\n2) if the developer does not provide any value for the configuration, then it will be treated as \"NotSet\" and an appropriate default value based on the \"type\" argument will be returned. If no \"type\" argument is provided, the an empty string will be returned.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know which approach would be more acceptable?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nSharad\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1740680401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SharadNair7","id":134932980,"node_id":"U_kgDOCArp9A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134932980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7","html_url":"https://github.com/SharadNair7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharadNair7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10509785302,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAjwLdc5tgF31zwAAAAJybpjW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/10509785302","actor":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-29T10:37:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10509785312,"node_id":"SE_lADOAjwLdc5tgF31zwAAAAJybpjg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/10509785312","actor":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-29T10:37:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10509785325,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAjwLdc5tgF31zwAAAAJybpjt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/10509785325","actor":{"login":"harmin-parra","id":16239820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM5ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16239820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra","html_url":"https://github.com/harmin-parra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harmin-parra/received_even

PR fixes #11282. As per the issue, if an option is created with default value as None and a value for the option is not set in the ini file, then trying to get the option value in code with config.getini() returns an empty list [] instead of None as expected.\r\n\r\n**Analysis**\r\nOn investigating it was found that the logic to return a default value for a configuration option is as follows:\r\nif a default value is set during the creation of the option, then the set default value is returned\r\nif a default value is NOT set during the option creation but the type for the option is provided, then return an empty list\r\nif neither a default value nor type is provided while creating the option, then assume its a string type and return an empty string\r\n\r\nThe above logic did not seem right. Also, the logic above did not honor None as an explicit default value to return.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nThe solution provided in this PR will change the behavior in the following way:\r\nif a default value is NOT set during the option creation but the type for the option is provided, then a type specific default will be returned. That is as follows:\r\n\t\"paths\", \"pathlist\", \"args\", \"linelist\" types will have a default empty list [] as these are all lists\r\n\t\"bool\" will have False as default\r\n\t\"string\" will have empty string \"\" as default\r\n\tlogically there can't be any other type as the code checks for valid types before hand. However, just as a fail safe for future,        any other types will have a default of None\r\n\r\nif a default value is set explicitly as **None** during the option creation, then **None** will be returned as the default value irrespective of the type\r\nif neither a default value nor type is provided while creating the option, assume its a string type and return an empty string. (This assumption stays as it is from the existing code)\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [X] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits

am really sorry to say, a subtle bug has been introduced by this commit, and I didn't see it while doing the review 😫 \r\n\r\nAt the moment, `modules` is always `['']` which prevents Redis to start...\r\nI wonder how it could pass all tests ?\r\n\r\nIn anyways, the fix is super easy, in file `pytest_redis/config.py` instead of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (modules := get_conf_option(\"modules\")) is not None:\r\n                                             ^^^^^^^^^^\r\n        modules = modules.split(\",\")\r\nelse:\r\n        modules = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe config key is empty string so it is enough to make the test as: `if (modules := get_conf_option(\"modules\")):`\r\n\r\nAgain, I apologize for not having seen it
