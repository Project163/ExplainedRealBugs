[X] a detailed description of the bug or suggestion\r\n\r\nI have two copies of a package on my computer: one which is installed (at `/storage/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/trtools`) and one which has been cloned from git (at `/tmp/trtools_data_download/trtools`). I'm doing this because I want to test the installed package but some of the test data only exists in the repo and not in the installation.\r\n\r\nI want to test the installed package with pytest, but when I run it it is picking up the python test files from the cloned git repo and not the installation, even though I've cd'd to the root of the installation. Any idea why this is happening?\r\n\r\nHere is the relevant output. Note the location of `test_compareSTR.py` file that is being run is not the copy in my current subdirectory.\r\n\r\nThe `--datadir` argument is something my tests pick up via the instructions [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html#pass-different-values-to-a-test-function-depending-on-command-line-options). It's the only thing I can think of that could be mucking with test discovery.
