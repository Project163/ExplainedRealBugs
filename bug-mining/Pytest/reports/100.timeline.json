@jrbenny35, thanks for reaching out!\r\n\r\nI don't know the intricacies of the assertion rewriting myself, but you can start digging around the `_pytest/assertion` directory. \r\n\r\nFor example currently a warning is issued when an `assert` is used with a `tuple` [here](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/71527072801b6d83db168996529be1e76ce96bc4/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py#L733-L736). \r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to know that an `assert` statement is receiving a tuple at *parsing* time, to realize if an arbitrary expression is returning `None` we need to check this at runtime.\r\n\r\nI would start by adding a breakpoint in `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` while debugging a test like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef x(): return None\r\n\r\ndef test():\r\n    assert x()\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo try to figure out how pytest generates this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_asserts.py:5 (test)\r\ndef test():\r\n>       assert x()\r\nE       assert None\r\nE        +  where None = x()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps! 👍
