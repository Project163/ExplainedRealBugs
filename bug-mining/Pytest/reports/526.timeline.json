sure if I like the additional churn after we already had multiple iterations of strict options changed (even with an alias, it gets confusing if people see/use different things to do the same thing).\n\nNote how `--strict` and `--strict-*` are currently CLI options, but `xfail_strict = True` is an ini option. IMHO naming consistency between the two isn't important, because they're two different things, and already inconsistent anyways.\n\nIf anything, IMHO we should have `strict` / `strict_markers` / `strict_config` / `strict_xfail` as ini options (see https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13823#issuecomment-3422982167) rather than CLI flags, and then it makes sense to make the naming consistent. But if we go there, please let's do it in one step instead of doing the `xfail_strict` rename/alias in one release and the CLI -> INI move of the rest in another.\n\nIf we end up with aliasing options, IMHO there's a discussion to be had whether to deprecate the old way. Yes, it causes churn, but so does having two ways to do the same thing (especially for newcomers which might see both in different tutorials, and then they also need to know about which pytest version they use,
