for suggesting a feature!\r\n\r\nQuick check-list while suggesting features:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What's the problem this feature will solve?\r\n<!-- What are you trying to do, that you are unable to achieve with pytest as it currently stands? -->\r\n\r\nIt's possible to create custom markers like so:\r\n```py\r\n@pytest.mark.my_device_under_test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis marker can the be used to de/select tests via marker expressions, e.g.:\r\n`pytest -m \"not my_device_under_test\"`\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to define keyword arguments for custom markers, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n@pytest.mark.my_device_under_test(with_serial=\"1234\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, it would be amazing to select tests further depending on their keyword arguments + values, e.g.:\r\n\r\n`pytest -m \"my_device_under_test(with_serial=\"1234)\"`\r\n\r\nSo only tests with that specific marker + that specific keyword argument+value would be run.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\nMarker keyword argument selection in pytest's marker expression.\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable and how it solves the problem described above. -->\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Solutions\r\n<!-- Have you tried to workaround the problem using a pytest plugin or other tools? Or a different approach to solving this issue? Please elaborate here. -->\r\n\r\n- There was a `nose` test plugin, which supported something similar [here](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/blob/master/nose/plugins/attrib.py). This could be ported to pytest but comes with it's own `attr` decorator.\r\n\r\n- A pytest plugin could probably do this in an extra step as well, but would somehow need to disable pytest's internal marker selection plugin [here](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py#L261) as it would collide/fail otherwise.\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\nWhen skimming through the code I saw that @bluetech implemented a custom parsers some years ago. I'm not very familiar with the topic, as in how much effort it would be support such feature. I'd be interested to contribute though. \r\n<!-- Add any other context, links, etc. about the feature here. -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
