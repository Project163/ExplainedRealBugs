docs and cli help are a bit confusing around the `--junitxml`/`--junit-xml` cli option (and probably some comparable options).\r\n\r\n\r\n`pytest --help` only mentions `--junit-xml=path` (e.g. also see https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/reference/reference.html#command-line-flags):\r\n```text\r\n  --junit-xml=path      Create junit-xml style report file at given path\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, most examples in the docs (and mosts tests) use `--junitxml`, e.g. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/0ded3297a9749aabad7d3c2447dce98321741dda/doc/en/how-to/output.rst#creating-junitxml-format-files :\r\n\r\n```rst\r\nTo create result files which can be read by Jenkins_ or other Continuous\r\nintegration servers, use this invocation:\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: bash\r\n\r\n    pytest --junitxml=path\r\n\r\nto create an XML file at ``path``.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was quite confusing to me as it seemed there was a typo somewhere and I lost time just to figure out that they are aliases actually:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/0ded3297a9749aabad7d3c2447dce98321741dda/src/_pytest/junitxml.py#L384-L386\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be better to stick to one of the two everywhere or at least more explicitly mention that they are aliases?","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11091/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
