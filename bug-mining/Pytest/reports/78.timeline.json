some usage errors produce very ugly traceback with pytest's internals.

This way we can raise that exception on errors that we know are usage problems and where displaying the entire traceback is not helpful in general. With this PR the error above produces this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n============================================= ERRORS ==============================================\r\n_____________________________ ERROR collecting test-scope-mismatch.py _____________________________\r\nfixture fix from test-scope-mismatch.py has an unsupported scope value 'modu'\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Is this approach sound?\r\n2. Should we use `UsageError` or create a new type of exception? Should it be public so plugins can use it too?\r\n3. Comments about verbosity handling done here?\r\n\r\nRefs: #2293, #3867, #2535, #3332\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nEDIT: in the end we don't need a new exception, we just have to use `pytest.fail(..., pytrace=False)` instead of general exceptions and make sure we also treat `Failed` exceptions during collection.\r\n\r\nFixes #2293, Fixes #3867 \r\n\r\nI will resolve #3332 in a separate PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4077/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1900729408,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5MDA3Mjk0MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1900729408","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8e11fe530487e560ac52f49ec50bda1f49718554","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/8e11fe530487e560ac52f49ec50bda1f49718554","created_at":"2018-10-12T13:20:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-12T13:24:36Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T13:24:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4124","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4124/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4124/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4124/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/4124","id":369550275,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjIyNDY1NDY4","number":4124,"title":"Improve
