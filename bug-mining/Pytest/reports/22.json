Fails!\r\n```\r\n## Suggestion\r\nOne can either add this line into `.clear()`:\r\n```python\r\nself.handler.stream = py.io.TextIO()\r\n```\r\nOR add this one, which will work also for clients holding handler's `stream` property:\r\n```python\r\nself.handler.stream.truncate(0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n```bash\r\npip list |grep pytest\r\npytest (3.4.2)\r\npytest-cov (2.5.1)\r\npytest-cover (3.0.0)\r\npytest-coverage (0.0)\r\npytest-mock (1.7.1)\r\npytest-runner (4.0)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
