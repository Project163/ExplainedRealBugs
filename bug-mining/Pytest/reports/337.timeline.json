first-time contributor here, so I'm very open to any suggestions on any of the following! \r\n\r\n### The Issue\r\n\r\nI've managed to track down this issue to  lines 448 and 449 in the function `_repr_failure_py` in the nodes.py file:\r\n```\r\nif not excinfo.value.pytrace:\r\n    style = \"value\"\r\n```\r\nIt seems that the test case above creates an `excinfo` instance with value.pytrace set to false, which results in an override of  the style to \"value\", even though the style parameter of `_repr_failiure_py` is correctly passed in as \"line\" at the beginning of the function. \r\n\r\nBecause the style is reset to \"value\", the repr_chain is appended to by the following code (Line 953-956 of code.py)\r\n```\r\nif self.style == \"value\":\r\n    repr_chain += [(reprtraceback, None, descr)] # This runs, resulting in the None value for the test\r\nelse:\r\n    repr_chain += [(reprtraceback, reprcrash, descr)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis propagates through a trail of function calls, eventually causing the bug in a call to `_getcrashline` in terminal.py that fails to throw an `AttributeError` here: \r\n```\r\ntry: \r\n    return str(rep.longrepr.reprcrash) # this returns str(None) = \"None\", not the expected AttributeError\r\nexcept AttributeError:\r\n    try:\r\n        return str(rep.longrepr)[:50] # this contains the expected value \"foo\", but doesn't currently run\r\n    except AttributeError:\r\n        return \"\"\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Suggested Fix\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution I could find is to add a simple check in nodes.py that prevents the \"line\" style from being overridden when excinfo.value.pytrace is False, i.e. \r\n```\r\nif not excinfo.value.pytrace and style != \"line\":\r\n    style = \"value\"\r\n```\r\nI'm planning on opening a PR for this issue tomorrow (as soon as I can get a test or two set up to double-check this works) but of course any feedback is welcome in the meantime.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1504381457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"acjreno","id":59836767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODM2NzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59836767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno","html_url":"https://github.com/acjreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acjreno/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1504447643","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10831#issuecomment-1504447643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10831","id":1504447643,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc5ZrAyb","user":{"login":"ikonst","id":1186084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1186084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst","html_url":"https://github.com/ikonst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-12T02:20:48Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T02:20:48Z","body":">
