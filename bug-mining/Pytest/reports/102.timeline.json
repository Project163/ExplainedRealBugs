@rth thanks for the excellent description and examples, they are extremely helpful in making the case about doing something about this matter.\r\n\r\nSo we have two proposals:\r\n\r\n1. Deprecate `message` and use another name. I think using a longer name like `show_failure_message` is perfectly fine, my gut feeling is that this parameter is rarely used (only misused). This option to me is safest.\r\n\r\n2. Removing the parameter altogether (after deprecating it of course). This would make it match (heh) `pytest.warn` signature as well. This is an excellent option in the long term if there are no good use-cases for it.\r\n\r\nI'm writing an e-mail to the mailing list to ask opinions to this, in particular if there are good cases for

for `pytest.raises` is a stumbling block.  Problems:\r\n\r\n~1. The \"message\" kwarg violates principle of least surprise.  User probably expected: simple match on exception message (useful), but it's actually for providing custom failure message (not very useful). Recommend deprecation.~   `message` has now been deprecated.\r\n~2. The \"match\" kwarg violates principle of least surprise.  It will catch substrings, for example. And it's annoying when the error message itself contains regex syntax that you'll need to escape. Could possibly be renamed to \"regexp\" or something?~   ...don't care / don't use it\r\n~3. No easy way to achieve the most simple and basic use-case: assert exact match on an exception instance args with basic types such as strings and/or numbers.~   use the plugin instead: [pytest-raisin](https://github.com/wimglenn/pytest-raisin)\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of problematic usage.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# looks right, but doesn't assert what it seems like it's asserting. trappy for beginners!\r\nwith pytest.raises(Exception, message=\"boom\"):\r\n    Exception(\"boom\")\r\n\r\n# whoops!\r\nwith pytest.raises(Exception, message=\"boom\"):\r\n    Exception(\"bang\")\r\n\r\n# whoops again! still not there yet..\r\nwith pytest.raises(Exception, match=\"boom\"):\r\n    Exception(\"kaboom\")\r\n\r\n# correct usage\r\nwith pytest.raises(Exception, match=\"^boom$\"):\r\n    Exception(\"kaboom\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if the thing you want to match is not really a string?  Can encounter this frequently when testing the CLI parts of code (since `argparse` is gonna raise `SystemExit` with an integer return code).  Problems:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# passes, but not why you thought\r\nwith pytest.raises(SystemExit, match=0):\r\n    sys.exit(0)\r\n\r\n# passes??\r\nwith pytest.raises(SystemExit, match=0):\r\n    sys.exit(1)\r\n\r\n# crashes, but crashes too late (`TypeError` in re compile)\r\nwith pytest.raises(SystemExit, match=1):\r\n    sys.exit(1)\r\n\r\n# correct usage\r\nwith pytest.raises(SystemExit) as cm:\r\n    sys.exit(0)\r\nassert cm.value.args == (0,)\r\n\r\n# another trap! d'oh!\r\nwith pytest.raises(SystemExit) as cm:\r\n    sys.exit(0)\r\n    assert cm.value.args == (0,)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to propose using exception instances to overcome these stumbling blocks. \r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith pytest.raises(SystemExit(2)):\r\n    sys.exit(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[`testfixtures.ShouldRaise`](https://testfixtures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exceptions.html#the-shouldraise-context-manager) is an example of this usage, and I'd love to have that interface in `pytest` directly. The comparison objects which make it work are non-trivial. A much easier to implement alternative, though less beautiful, might be just to support matching the args attribute as tuple. \r\n\r\n```\r\nwith pytest.raises(SomeError, exc_args=(2, \"code two\")):\r\n    raise SomeError(2, \"code two\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdmittedly it won't help people who put too much logic into their custom exception classes, but it should cover majority standard use-cases (where exceptions are dumb subclasses, just with a custom numeric error code or message).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4538/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2022644740,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwMjI2NDQ3NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/2022644740","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9741a8c190098df5ff45caaaeca43922f6c652b9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/9741a8c190098df5ff45caaaeca43922f6c652b9","created_at":"2018-12-12T21:13:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-12T21:13:58Z","updated_at":"2018-12-12T21:13:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4539","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4539/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4539/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4539/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/4539","id":390411352,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjM4MTg0Mjcx","number":4539,"title":"Deprecate
