discussed in #517.\r\n\r\nImplement `setup_*/teardown_*` using fixtures injected during collection. \r\n\r\nDuring collection, `TestCase` subclasses with a `setup_` and/or `teardown_` methods would have this fixture injected in the class:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)\r\ndef _xunit_setup_teardown_function(self):\r\n    if hasattr(self, 'setup_method'):\r\n        self.setup_method(self)\r\n    yield\r\n    if hasattr(self, 'teardown_method'):\r\n        self.teardown_method(self)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf neither method is present, then this fixture is not injected at all.\r\n\r\nThe same would be done for `setUpClass` and `setUpModule`.\r\n\r\nThis would solve the problems mentioned in #517 quite nicely.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~~As discussed, this change might introduce subtle errors so this might be better introduced with an option to revert to the old implementation.~~ \r\n\r\nThis should no longer be a concern, because we will only handle pytest's methods this way.\r\n\r\nEDIT: updated regarding
