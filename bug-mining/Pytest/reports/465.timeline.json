Also I put the option in my `pyproject.toml` file as\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> [tool.pytest]\r\n> disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support = true\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> [...]\r\n> \r\n> but was unable to get any of those variations to display unescaped unicode.\r\n\r\nSo I found that if you're explicitly doing `pytest.param(..., id=\"...\")`, it'll always escape, regardless of configuration:\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/245a8c23dd0ffeb03710f0fbabd1f5e6a56611ab/src/_pytest/mark/structures.py#L95\r\n\r\nAs opposed to when the parameter itself is a string:\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/245a8c23dd0ffeb03710f0fbabd1f5e6a56611ab/src/_pytest/python.py#L1050\r\n\r\nSo perhaps it's a bug in that pytest should use the same logic with both explicit `id=\"...\"` and implicit ids. But personally, I would suggest that **explicitly set ids should not be escaped**. I would also accept the solution of _add a `escape=False` argument to `pytest.param` to turn off escaping_, if pytest devs want to avoid breaking backwards compat. My reasoning is that I don't want to enable this unsupported feature for the entire project, just for this specific test I need to test unicode for.\r\n\r\nI also want to echo other sentiments that this shouldn't be hidden in a flag, unicode should be the default everywhere, and OSes that have issues with pytest showing unicode should be updated (or perhaps a flag to enable unicode escaping in pytest).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1234838662/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brandonchinn178","id":6827922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mjc5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6827922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178","html_url":"https://github.com/brandonchinn178","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonchinn178/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1235045108","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9037#issuecomment-1235045108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9037","id":1235045108,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc5JnUr0","user":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-02T04:06:29Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T04:06:29Z","body":"My
