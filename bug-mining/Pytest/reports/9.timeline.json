Indeed `writer` was removed by accident while trying to revert 05cfdcc which rendered `_tw` read-only while preparing for 3.3 in #2945. The reason for that revert is because `pytest-instafail` plugin attempts to set `_tw` to something else. 😞 \r\n\r\nNot sure how to proceed here to be honest. Removing `writer` was a mistake, but I'm thinking re-adding `TerminalReporter.writer` only to deprecate it in the next release will only add to the confusion further.

pytest from 3.5.1 to 3.6.0 for scipy test suite brought up some test failures. An INTERNALERROR appears in the middle of the test run, when running some tests (that use pytest.mark), apparently related to a deprecation message emitted \"_pytest.deprecated.RemovedInPytest4Warning: MarkInfo objects are deprecated\".
