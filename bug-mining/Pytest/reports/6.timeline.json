Digging deeper, it appears that the immediate reason for this error is this commit that indicates that ascii escaping is no longer necessary because it is sanitized during the parametrization process.\r\n\r\nStrangely, that commit is available since `3.2.1` as shown by the tags in the commit page.\r\n\r\nWe already have a test in place which uses null bytes during parametrization and
