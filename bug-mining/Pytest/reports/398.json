It uses --doctest-modules and relies on some module-global setup/teardown specified in a `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)`.\r\n\r\nThis [broke](https://github.com/mgedmin/pyspacewar/issues/19) with the pytest 8.0.0 release.  If I run\r\n\r\n    pytest src/pyspacewar/tests/ --setup-show\r\n\r\nI can see that the autouse fixtures defined in my conftest.py are being called, but the autouse fixture in [src/pyspacewar/tests/test_main.py](https://github.com/mgedmin/pyspacewar/blob/5bbae0d47876e614c15a180dc7d9cb8f1940a2c6/src/pyspacewar/tests/test_main.py#L47-L50) (fake_game_ui) is not.
