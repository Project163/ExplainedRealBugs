this seems a fundamental change in behavior in how `testpaths` config is treated.  It's an optional fallback only used for test collection when no file paths are provided. But. it now always forces the pytest to load conftests pointed to by the root-level configured `testpaths`even when a specific file or directory of tests is provided. This breaks a paradigm where separate apps or integration tests versus unittests in a single project may have a different set of test dependencies pulled in by their `conftest`s.\r\n\r\nIs it desirable that the solution in #10988 should also treat `testpaths` only as an optional fallback value when namespace.file_or_dir is unset in ` _set_initial_conftests` [instead of always appending the value](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/10988/files#diff-df52f8f6a3544754cc8ebdf903594738e68a18dc9ac3c959f646cf4705a9afedR549)?\r\n\r\nWhat do we think of something like

Bug report\r\n\r\npytest 7.3.2 changed treatment of testpaths to now always load `conftest` from the tox configured testpaths. this breaks our integration-tests because our configured `testpaths` in `tox.ini` points to `tests/unittests` which carries with it a dependency on `responses` that is unneeded for our integration-tests target. This behavior breaks all of our jenkins test runners which don't need to express `responses` as a dependency.\r\n\r\nThis issue is known in [pytest issue: #11104](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11104) and will likely be reverted in the coming week and introduced as a separate config feature in a major release.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the problem\r\n```\r\ntox -e integration-test  # results in a traceback module not found `reponses`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment details\r\n\r\n## cloud-init logs\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide either the applicable excerpt of /var/log/cloud-init.log representing the failure or attach cloud-init-logs.tar.gz obtained by running `sudo cloud-init collect-logs`.
