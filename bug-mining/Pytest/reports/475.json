Only when we `print(fixt)` it becomes clear that this is a function object and what the mistake was.\r\n\r\nThis is due to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/cdddd6d69533c07092c64445a0d42d1fc75c8299/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py#L459-L461\r\n\r\nwhich was originally introduced in 65edf87.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for it can be found in the related issue:\r\n\r\n- #171 \r\n\r\nand it boils down to:\r\n\r\n> I think in some cases it can result in too verbose output, especially when using builtins where you don't really want to have extra information on \"len\", \"callable\" etc.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n> Another reason for this heuristic occurred to me: Many commonly used global names like classes and modules are more nicely displayed by their name rather than their repr.\r\n\r\nI believe this is useful in cases like `assert len(values) == 2` where we really don't need to drill down into what `len` is. However, it hides vital information in the case that one side of the `==` is a global callable directly, rather than it being used as a part of a bigger expression.","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11525/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
