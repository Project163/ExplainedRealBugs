Running `pytest` in a directory without a config file (or in one of the parents) means `config.inipath` is None.\r\n2. `-o pythonpath` uses a `type=\"paths\"` ini option.\r\n3. `type=\"paths\"` ini options are defined to take paths relative to `inipath`.\r\n4. The code does not handle 1 + 3 at the same time:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/73d754bd74ae8ddf86eb90cda29545cef495e927/src/_pytest/config/__init__.py#L1544-L1545\r\n\r\n    (note: similar assert is in legacypath plugin for `type=\"pathlist\"` options)\r\n\r\n### Possible solutions\r\n\r\nOption 1: raise an error in case of trying to use a `type=\"paths\"` option without an ini file.\r\n\r\nOption 1': same as 1 but only for relative paths, so absolute paths are OK.\r\n\r\nOption 2: use some other path instead if the inipath is not defined, most likely the current working directory/invocation path.\r\n\r\nSince this basically can only happen when using `-o` on the command line, I think Option 2 is sensible, but would be interested in other's opinion.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1679410908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10100193202,"node_id":"LE_lADOAjwLdc5uQV5KzwAAAAJaBLey","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/10100193202","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-15T18:33:59Z","label":{"name":"type:

see: I made the wrong assumption that `PYTHONPATH=src pytest` and `pytest -o pythonpath=src` should *always* be equivalent, but from your discussion I undestand now that the second one has a different meaning!\r\n\r\nSo I would suggest option 1 in order to enforce the *override ini* meaning of `-o`\r\n\r\n## Brief explanation of the cognitive pitfall\r\n\r\nProbably I didn't read the docs with sufficent attention, but my error here was to assume that every variable in the pytest [configuration options](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/reference/reference.html#configuration-options) *has* a default value, and thus *can* be overridden. But when a config file is missing, some variables are undefined, and there is no meaningful way to override them.\r\n\r\nAnother not so easy fact to undestand was that a `pyproject.toml` file defines the `self.inipath` only if it contains a possibly empty `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` table. I was confused from this fact, not being able to undestand why sometimes the `-o pythontpath=src` option didn't trigger an error.\r\n\r\nAs what regards option 2, I would therefore suggest to consider also the directory containing `pyproject.toml` etc. as the `self.inipath`, even if the file does not contain any pytest
