pull request addresses issue #13384, where time.time() was causing pytest to report negative durations due to its susceptibility to system clock adjustments.\r\n\r\nThe following changes were made:\r\n\r\n- Replaced all occurrences of time.time() with _pytest.timing.perf_counter() for more reliable and monotonic timing.\r\n-  Updated the relevant tests to use _pytest.timing.perf_counter() where applicable.\r\n- Added a changelog entry (13384.bugfix.rst) to document the fix.\r\n- Added myself to the AUTHORS file in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n- Closes #13384\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [X ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number).
