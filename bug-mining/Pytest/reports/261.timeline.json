to reproduce the bug: https://github.com/Wescoeur/pyfakefs-pytest-bug\r\nUse directly `pytest tests/` in the root folder of this repo.\r\nNote: If `log_cli` is disabled in `pytest.ini`, the assertion of the stacktrace is always true and we don't have the issue. The issue is triggered when `log_cli` is true and when the `fs` fixture is used in a test like in:\r\n```python\r\n    def test_bad(self, fs):\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your environment**\r\nLinux-5.16.1-arch1-1-x86_64-with-glibc2.33\r\nPython 3.10.1 (main, Dec 18 2021, 23:53:45) [GCC 11.1.0]\r\npyfakefs
