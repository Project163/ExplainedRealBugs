The test inside `test_wo_number` incorrectly passes only on the cases (test_1.py and test_2.py) where a failing test that uses `NUMBER` (test_w_off_by_2_number) also exists in the same module.   This leakage does not occur when there are tests that pass that utilize `NUMBER` (test_3.py)\r\n\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# test_1.py\r\ndef test_w_number():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Correctly Passes\r\n\r\n    Examples\r\n    --------\r\n    >>> 1.  # doctest: +NUMBER\r\n    0.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\ndef test_w_off_by_2_number():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Correctly Fails\r\n\r\n    Examples\r\n    --------\r\n    >>> 0.  # doctest: +NUMBER\r\n    2.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\ndef test_wo_number():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Incorrectly Passes\r\n\r\n    Examples\r\n    --------\r\n    >>> 1.\r\n    0.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# test_2.py\r\ndef test_w_off_by_2_number():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Correctly Fails\r\n\r\n    Examples\r\n    --------\r\n    >>> 0.  # doctest: +NUMBER\r\n    2.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_wo_number():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Incorrectly Passes\r\n\r\n    Examples\r\n    --------\r\n    >>> 1.\r\n    0.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# test_3.py\r\ndef test_w_number():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Correctly Passes\r\n\r\n    Examples\r\n    --------\r\n    >>> 1.  # doctest: +NUMBER\r\n    0.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\ndef test_wo_number():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Correctly Fails\r\n\r\n    Examples\r\n    --------\r\n    >>> 1.\r\n    0.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### pip list\r\n```txt\r\nPackage    Version\r\n---------- -------\r\nattrs      21.4.0\r\niniconfig  1.1.1\r\nnumpy      1.22.3\r\npackaging  21.3\r\npip        22.0.4\r\npluggy     1.0.0\r\npy         1.11.0\r\npyparsing  3.0.8\r\npytest     7.1.2\r\nsetuptools 41.2.0\r\ntomli      2.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### system version\r\n\r\nCentOS 7.9","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9924/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1120113528","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9892#issuecomment-1120113528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9892","id":1120113528,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc5Cw5N4","user":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-07T02:23:23Z","updated_at":"2022-05-07T02:23:23Z","body":"Ahh got it.
