detailed description of the bug or problem you are having, MWE**\n\nI have parametrized tests that take input data from a config, e.g., a list of matrices. It may happen that there is no input parameter at all, i.e., empty list of parameters, see below\n\n```# dev.py\nimport pytest\n\nparameters = []\n\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\n    \"matrix\",\n    parameters,\n    ids=lambda matrix: matrix.id,\n)\ndef test_foo(matrix):\n    return True\n```\n\nNow, I'd like to just collect matrices there are, i.e.\n` pytest dev.py --collect-only`\nbut it fails as it tries to create at least a single instance for `test_foo`. The reason is that `ids` is a callable and it's called with `NotSetType`. \n```\n===================================================================================================================================================== test session starts =====================================================================================================================================================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.11.3, pytest-8.3.3, pluggy-1.5.0\nbenchmark: 5.1.0 (defaults: timer=time.perf_counter disable_gc=False min_rounds=5 min_time=0.000005 max_time=1.0 calibration_precision=10 warmup=False warmup_iterations=100000)\nrootdir: ...\nconfigfile: ...\nplugins: monitor-1.6.1, benchmark-5.1.0\ncollected 0 items / 1 error                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n=========================================================================================================================================================== ERRORS ============================================================================================================================================================\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ERROR collecting dev.py ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\ndev.py:9: in <lambda>\n    ids=lambda matrix: matrix.id,\nE   AttributeError: 'NotSetType' object has no attribute 'id'\n\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pluggy/_hooks.py:513: in __call__\n    return self._hookexec(self.name, self._hookimpls.copy(), kwargs, firstresult)\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pluggy/_manager.py:120: in _hookexec\n    return self._inner_hookexec(hook_name, methods, kwargs, firstresult)\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:245: in pytest_pycollect_makeitem\n    return list(collector._genfunctions(name, obj))\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:462: in _genfunctions\n    self.ihook.pytest_generate_tests.call_extra(methods, dict(metafunc=metafunc))\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pluggy/_hooks.py:574: in call_extra\n    return self._hookexec(self.name, hookimpls, kwargs, firstresult)\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pluggy/_manager.py:120: in _hookexec\n    return self._inner_hookexec(hook_name, methods, kwargs, firstresult)\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:115: in pytest_generate_tests\n    metafunc.parametrize(*marker.args, **marker.kwargs, _param_mark=marker)\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:1236: in parametrize\n    ids = self._resolve_parameter_set_ids(\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:1355: in _resolve_parameter_set_ids\n    return id_maker.make_unique_parameterset_ids()\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:897: in make_unique_parameterset_ids\n    resolved_ids = list(self._resolve_ids())\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:932: in _resolve_ids\n    yield \"-\".join(\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:933: in <genexpr>\n    self._idval(val, argname, idx)\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:939: in _idval\n    idval = self._idval_from_function(val, argname, idx)\n.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_pytest/python.py:961: in _idval_from_function\n    raise ValueError(msg) from e\nE   ValueError: dev.py::test_foo: error raised while trying to determine id of parameter 'matrix' at position 0\n=================================================================================================================================================== short test summary info ===================================================================================================================================================\nERROR dev.py -

I have no control on what data are in the config, I just need to test the thing without failures. The workaround is doable but I would don't like writing these for each single case, and frankly, don't understand why `ids` are invoked at all.\n\n**output of `pip list` from the virtual environment

Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a pytest fixture with an empty `params` list and an `ids` function that references an attribute of the param, e.g.:\n```python\n@pytest.fixture(params=[], ids=lambda x: x.id)\ndef empty_param(request):\n    return request.param\n```\n\n2.Write a test function that uses this fixture:\n```python\ndef test_empty_param(empty_param):\n    pass\n```\n\n3.Run the test using the pytest command:\n```\npytest test_foo.py::test_empty_param\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior:\nThe test should either be skipped or provide a more informative error message indicating that the params list is empty.\n\n### Actual Behavior:\nThe test raises an AttributeError: 'NotSetType' object has no attribute 'id' error.\n\n### Error Output\n```\ntests/test_foo.py:None (tests/test_foo.py)\ntest_foo.py:163: in <lambda>\n    @pytest.fixture(params=[], ids=lambda x: x.id)\nE   AttributeError: 'NotSetType' object has no attribute 'id'\n\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\n../venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pluggy/_hooks.py:513: in __call__\n    return self._hookexec(self.name, self._hookimpls.copy(), kwargs, firstresult)\n...\nE   ValueError: tests/test_foo.py::test_empty_param: error raised while trying to determine id of parameter 'empty_param' at position 0\ncollected 0 items / 1 error\n```\n\n### Environment:\npytest version: 8.3.4\nPython version: 3.12\nOperating System: macOS\n\n### Possible Solution:\nProvide a more informative error message or skip the test when the params list is empty. Alternatively, document the expected behavior when using an empty params list with a custom ids function.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
