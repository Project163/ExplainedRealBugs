just tried to parse an junit-xml file, which was created by pytest.\r\nThe parser and also my IDE (PyCharm) claim about not escaped chars.\r\n \r\nHere is an example, which was generated by  `pytest --junitxml`:\r\n```\r\n<testsuite errors=\"0\" failures=\"0\" name=\"pytest\" skips=\"10\" tests=\"10\" time=\"0.054\">\r\n    <testcase classname=\"setup\" file=\"setup.py\" line=\"-1\" name=\"FLAKE8\" time=\"0.000252246856689\">\r\n        <skipped message=\"file(s) previously passed FLAKE8 checks\" type=\"pytest.skip\">\r\n        /some/folders/python2.7/site-packages/pytest_flake8.py:106: <py._xmlgen.raw object at 0x7fd5a8a0e950>\r\n        </skipped>\r\n    </testcase>\r\n</testsuite>\r\n```\r\nThe problem is inside the text of the `skipped` node.\r\nThere is a not escaped `<` (after the path):\r\n`/some/folders/python2.7/site-packages/pytest_flake8.py:106: <py._xmlgen...`\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, if this bug affects skipped tests only or if `<` is the only problematic char.\r\n\r\nIf you are not so familiar with allowed chars in xml (like me), here is a nice SO answer:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/1091953\r\n\r\nFinally some details about my installed versions:\r\n```\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.5.2, pytest-3.6.0, py-1.5.3, pluggy-0.6.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"crazymerlyn","id":6919679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTk2Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6919679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn","html_url":"https://github.com/crazymerlyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazymerlyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3533/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
