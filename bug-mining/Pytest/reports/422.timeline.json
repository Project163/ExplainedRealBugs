confirmed that the cause is as described in my previous comment https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7166#issuecomment-873917140.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions I can think of:\r\n\r\nSolution 1: Change pytest-xdist to not intermix hook calls for different item's runtestprotocol hooks.\r\nI didn't assess this, seems desirable in some respects (probably there are other plugins which get confused by this), but probably has some ill effects as well, with respect to \"lying\" about the ordering and delaying.\r\n\r\nSolution 2: change pytest to not have this split printing between logreport and logfinish. So either: do everything in logfinish, but then printing the `.` is delayed waiting for teardown; or do everything in `logreport`, but then we print `100%` and then seem \"stuck\" waiting for possibly-lengthy session teardown (instead of the `100%` not showing until teardown is complete).\r\n\r\nSolution 3: *always* display the progress at the end of the line (updated on each `.`), not just when *reaching* the end of the line, then there is no question of when to show it. The `TerminalReporter`/`TerminalWriter` are currently \"append only\" and not really built for this as far as I can see, so will need some reworking.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking the 2nd solution with moving the progress reporting to `logreport` + a special case for the 100%.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2046091591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12633207021,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc4khWR1zwAAAALw_3Dt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/12633207021","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3a5c08a7e073e14f156aa6dfaee51610f831136d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bluetech/pytest/commits/3a5c08a7e073e14f156aa6dfaee51610f831136d","created_at":"2024-04-27T22:03:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-27T22:08:48Z","updated_at":"2024-04-27T22:08:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12258","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12258/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12258/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12258/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/12258","id":2267212680,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAjwLdc5t6uYV","number":12258,"title":"terminal:
