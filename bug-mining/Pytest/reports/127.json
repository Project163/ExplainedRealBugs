To avoid\r\n                        loading of plugins, use the `no:` prefix, e.g.\r\n                        `no:doctest`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hoped to use this to early-load the code coverage plugin `pytest-cov`. (The motivation is that `pytest-cov` should be loaded before any other plugins, but on some of our machines `pytest-django` is loading first, resulting in about a 15% coverage difference, which causes tests to fail on those machines because we have `--fail-under` set for enforcement of code coverage.) However, as discussed in #935, `-p` is broken and no longer works. Here are all the different approaches I tried:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# disables plugin\r\n$ pytest -p pytest_cov\r\nusage: pytest [options] [file_or_dir] [file_or_dir] [...]\r\npytest: error: unrecognized arguments: --cov-report --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=90 --cov=.......\r\n\r\n# does not recognize it\r\n$ pytest -p pytest-cov\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/_pytest/config/__init__.py\", line 530, in import_plugin\r\n    __import__(importspec)\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytest-cov'\r\n\r\n# does not recognize it\r\n$ pytest -p cov\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/_pytest/config/__init__.py\", line 530, in import_plugin\r\n    __import__(importspec)\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cov'\r\n\r\n# finally no error, but does not load it early\r\n$ pytest -p coverage\r\n================= test session starts =================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.7.1, pytest-4.1.1, py-1.7.0, pluggy-0.8.1\r\nDjango settings: xxxx.settings.dev_local (from environment variable)\r\nrootdir: /srv/xxxx, inifile: setup.cfg\r\nplugins: django-3.4.6, cov-2.6.1, pysoa-0.56.0\r\ncollected 256 items\r\n...\r\nxxxx/settings/__init__.py                           36     36      0      0     0.0%   1-135\r\nxxxx/settings/dev_local.py                          33     33      6      0     0.0%   1-125\r\nxxxx/settings/jenkins_test.py                       24     24      4      0     0.0%   1-131\r\nxxxx/settings/production_docker.py                  23     23      9      0     0.0%   1-125\r\n...\r\n\r\n# gives an error about its already being loaded\r\n$ pytest -p pytest_cov.plugin\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/pytest\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(main())\r\n...\r\nValueError: Plugin already registered: pytest_cov=<module 'pytest_cov.plugin' from '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytest_cov/plugin.py'>\r\n{'140434823318496': <_pytest.config.PytestPluginManager object at 0x7fb987c20be0>, 'pytestconfig': <_pytest.config.Config object at 0x7fb98498c5c0> ......\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a regression or if this command-line argument has always been mis-documented and wasn't actually intended for early-loading plugins. Either way, it's a bug. The `-p` argument conflicts with the entrypoints plugin loading system and there is no way to early-load a plugin unless it doesn't have an entrypoint.","closed_by":{"login":"blueyed","id":9766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed","html_url":"https://github.com/blueyed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
