   logger.info(\"Normal\")\r\n    logger.info(\"\\u251c\")\r\n    logger.info(\"Also normal\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when I run it using `--log-cli-level=INFO` then I get this terminal output, which is fine:\r\n```\r\n============================= test session starts =============================\r\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.6.3, pytest-3.6.2, py-1.5.4, pluggy-0.6.0 --
