@sbouchut, thanks for the report.\r\n\r\n@RonnyPfannschmidt is right, this is related to #3390: we are now using [atomicwrites](https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites) to write rewritten `.pyc` files because they might be corrupted on Windows otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe snippet showing the problem is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/48215fdcb90baf9abc1f83661d9d8be3e72a4b22/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py#L263-L271\r\n\r\nI'm surprised `fp.file` somehow is not a file, given that all our `py27` suite works with that code.\r\n\r\n@sbouchut could you please run your code with pytest from `nicoddemus/temp-check-atomicwrite-file`? I added a temporary check and better error message to that branch.\r\n\r\nI see you are using tox, so this would be a matter of changing this in your `tox.ini`:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\ndeps = \r\n    pytest     \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo this:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\ndeps = \r\n    git+https://github.com/nicoddemus/pytest@temp-check-atomicwrite-file\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould you then post the output?
