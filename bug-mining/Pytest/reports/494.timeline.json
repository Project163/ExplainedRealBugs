new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved
