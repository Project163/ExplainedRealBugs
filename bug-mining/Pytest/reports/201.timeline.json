assert False\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat happens is this:\r\n\r\n- At startup, the root logger is not configured with any handlers.\r\n- At collection, the root logger is still not configured, so the `logging.warning` call triggers a `logging.basicConfig()` call, which adds a `StreamHandler` to the root logger.\r\n- The logging plugin respects existing handlers if they exist.\r\n\r\nSo the log messages end up printed to stdout.\r\n\r\nThe proper way to fix this issue depends on the answer to the question: what should pytest do with logs emitted during collection?\r\n\r\nPR #6283 answer is to throw them away. \r\n\r\nAnother option is to capture and them display them in some manner.\r\n\r\nI think throwing them away is the way to go, by analogy with what capture does with prints during
