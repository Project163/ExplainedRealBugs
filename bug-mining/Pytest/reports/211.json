So things like this are possible:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport sys, py\r\nassert sys.platform == \"win32\"\r\n\r\na = py.path.local(\"/some/path\")\r\nb = py.path.local(\"/some/PATH\")\r\nassert a == b  # Passes\r\nassert a in {b}  # Fails\r\nassert a in {b: 'b'}  # Fails\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis probably causes some subtle bugs in pytest, which uses several dicts & sets of `py.path.local`s. Since `py` is frozen, it's not possible to fix there.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked it yet, but wanted to make a note for later.","closed_by":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7357/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
