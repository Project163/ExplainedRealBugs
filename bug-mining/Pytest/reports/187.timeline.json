For a review, please follow the commit series and messages.\r\n\r\n**Situation**: Both `reorder_items` and `FixtureDef.execute` must decide and agree about whether fixture instances can be reused. The obvious is to decide by comparing parameter values. Sadly none of `prm1 == prm2`, `prm1 is prm2` or `hash(prm1) == hash(prm2)` is generally suited to decide about \"are parameters the same?\":\r\n- `dict`s are not hashable\r\n- numpy arrays don't compare to bool, and are not hashable either\r\n- `object`s compare and hash by identity, but a user may expect reuse only if it's equal by value\r\n\r\nUsing the parameter index instead of value doesn't work either, because, well, see #8914.\r\n\r\n**Idea**: Give users the option to explicitly control equality of parameters by leveraging [parameter ids](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/reference.html#pytest.python.Metafunc.parametrize). Under the hood we introduce a `param_key` to support fixture reordering and caching. The key is built according to the following rules\r\n1. If parameter ids have been passed via API, use that parameter id as key.\r\n1. Else, if a parameter value is hashable, use that parameter value as key.\r\n2. Else, fallback to a parameter values identity.\r\n\r\n**Example 1**: Use `id=` to control equality of the unhashable `dict` parameters (rule 1 applies).\r\n```python\r\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\r\ndef foo(request.param):\r\n    pass  # goal: minimize nrof setup/teardown\r\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [pytest.param({\"data\": \"a\"}, id=\"0\"), pytest.param({\"data\": \"b\"}, id=\"1\")], indirect=True)\r\ndef test1(foo):\r\n    pass\r\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [pytest.param({\"data\": \"b\"}, id=\"1\"), pytest.param({\"data\": \"a\"}, id=\"0\")], indirect=True)\r\ndef test2(foo):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example 2**: No need to use `id=` or `ids=` if the parameter is hashable by value (rule 2 applies).\r\n```python\r\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\r\ndef foo(request.param):\r\n    pass  # goal: minimize nrof setup/teardown\r\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [\"a\", \"b\"], indirect=True)\r\ndef test1(foo):\r\n    pass\r\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [\"b\", \"a\"], indirect=True)\r\ndef test2(foo):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso related: #244, #5693, #6497, #6541.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9420/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
