notes:\r\n\r\n- On my use case there are many imports (around 3000 imports) and there are many entries in `sys.path` (67 to be more exact) -- this makes `imp.find_import` very slow (it does way too many calls to `os.stat` in the scenario) -- on my use case imports are around 30% faster with my patch in place in Py 2 and 40% faster on Py 3 on my measurements (granted my case is probably an edge case for `imp.find_import`).\r\n\r\n- I took a look at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/ and it says the following:\r\n\r\n    The following set of methods may be implemented if support for (for example) Freeze-like tools is desirable. It consists of three additional methods which, to make it easier for the caller, each of which should be implemented, or none at all:\r\n\r\n    loader.is_package(fullname)\r\n    loader.get_code(fullname)\r\n    loader.get_source(fullname)\r\n\r\n\r\n    So, as the loader had `is_package` and not the others I simply removed `is_package` and things still seem to be working -- which is good because it was also calling `imp.find_module` (only on Python 3, it seems it was unused on Python 2 -- which also means imports were slower on Python 3 than on Python 2).\r\n\r\nFix
