common debugging strategy is to study the logs.\r\nBut sometimes the program issues excessive logging messages, \r\nnecessitating the selective disabling of babbler loggers.\r\n\r\nThis SO captures the crux & solution of this Request For Enhancement:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/57002853/548792\r\n\r\nAlthough the proposed SO solution of a new ``--disable-log`` option works perfectly fine, \r\nit is annoying to have to patch every new project,\r\nplus, it does not support auto-completion e.g. on bash.\r\n\r\n- Would it make sense to include such capability into core code?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm suggesting the new option to be called ``--logger-disabled``,\r\nto fit with the existing option names starting with  ``--log-...``.","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7431/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
