The issue was introduced by PR #9354, which enforced strict equality for boolean values in pytest.approx.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nModify the __eq__ method in the ApproxScalar class to handle numpy booleans appropriately.\r\nThis ensures that comparisons between numpy booleans and regular booleans work as expected.\r\n\r\nIssue Link:
