This causes the call to `len` to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will take a shot at fixing this.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1117691581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ZachOBrien","id":20273689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjczNjg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20273689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien","html_url":"https://github.com/ZachOBrien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"ZachOBrien","id":20273689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjczNjg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20273689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien","html_url":"https://github.com/ZachOBrien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZachOBrien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-06T05:40:34Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T05:40:34Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9921","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9921/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9921/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9921/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/9921","id":1227441889,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAjwLdc43ZMWt","number":9921,"title":"Fix
