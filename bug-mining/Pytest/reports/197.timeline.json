Previously, it would just point one failing test, the one with a failing assertion. All others would run without any transaction errors.\r\n\r\nTo test this, I fresh installed our env, without pin-pointing `pytest`'s version and it installs version 5.4.1.\r\nThen I modified a working test so that it fails, and got many failing tests, one with the assertion and all others with `TransactionManagementError`.\r\nThan ran `pip install pytest=5.3.5.` manually, ran the suite again, and only one test was failing - the one with the wrong assertion.   \r\n\r\n**I can't show code, nor the tests, nor the environment because this is still a closed-source application and I don't want to

no longer contains error data since pytest 5.4.0\r\n\r\nMy test framework uses pytest to run tests that use a unittest.TestCase structure, and in the tearDown() method I was able to get error output from failing tests by using:\r\n``self._outcome.errors``\r\nThis was working fine with pytest 5.3.5, but stopped working with pytest 5.4.0\r\n\r\nThis technique was made possible by this very popular solution on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39606065\r\n\r\nHere's a code snippet that uses this technique to get the error from the tearDown() step when a test fails an assertion:\r\n```python\r\nimport unittest\r\n\r\nclass MyTest(unittest.TestCase):\r\n\r\n    def tearDown(self):\r\n        if hasattr(self, '_outcome'):\r\n            errors = self._outcome.errors\r\n            ...\r\n```\r\nI would like pytest to restore the use of ``self._outcome.errors`` so that tearDown() methods can easily access the error output of tests.\r\nThe test framework that I'm using (which I've built) is called SeleniumBase => https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase\r\nMy workaround for now has been to hard-code ``pytest 5.3.5`` into the requirements file for SeleniumBase. Given the large number of companies using SeleniumBase for test automation, I have to keep things working while waiting for a fix to arrive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7000/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3195325829,"node_id":"MDExOlBpbm5lZEV2ZW50MzE5NTMyNTgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/3195325829","actor":{"login":"blueyed","id":9766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed","html_url":"https://github.com/blueyed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueyed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"pinned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-03T08:13:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/608577628","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6947#issuecomment-608577628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6947","id":608577628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwODU3NzYyOA==","user":{"login":"mdmintz","id":6788579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODg1Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6788579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz","html_url":"https://github.com/mdmintz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmintz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-03T17:53:06Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T17:53:06Z","body":"Here's a unit test to add to https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/testing/test_unittest.py when the fix is ready.
