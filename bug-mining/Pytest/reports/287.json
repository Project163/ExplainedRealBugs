This is a great work done by Pytest maintainers, and pushes the community towards a better future.\r\n\r\nHowever, after informing plugin maintainers about the upcoming changes, I would like to silence these warnings so I can focus in fixing the errors detected on the tests (otherwise the output is too big and difficult to scroll through to find useful information).\r\n\r\nTo solve this, I naturally tried to modify my `pytest.ini` file with a `ignore` filter for these warnings, however Pytest is still printing some of them even after I added the warning filters.\r\n\r\n### Example for reproduction\r\n\r\nThe following script can be used to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject.git\r\ncd sampleproject\r\nsed -i '/^\\s*pytest$/a \\    pytest-flake8' tox.ini\r\nsed -i '/^\\s*pytest$/a \\    pytest-black' tox.ini\r\nsed -i 's/py.test tests/py.test tests --black --flake8/' tox.ini\r\ncat << _STR > pytest.ini\r\n[pytest]\r\nfilterwarnings=\r\n    #
