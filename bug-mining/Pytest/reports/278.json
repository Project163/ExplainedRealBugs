another subtle API break I discovered in 7.0.0 (sorry...):\r\n\r\nBefore #9277, `Module` and `Class` nodes had a `instance` attribute from `PyobjMixin` (via `PyCollector`). With that change, that attribute now is only available on `Function` nodes.\r\n\r\nThis affected [pytest-randomly](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-randomly/pull/423/files#diff-1d0b9be406e1b73152251fd7671c81e1d93adb58ce9ae93a14daf147e0ef85d7L706) - I don't see a good way to find out how much more it affects (can't really search for `.instance`, and there are lots of ways to get to those nodes).\r\n\r\nI doubt it will affect much more, but we should either re-add the attribute (probably just set to `None` plus a deprecation warning?), or if we decide to remove it without a deprecation (fine by me), at least document the removal as usual.\r\n\r\ncc @bluetech ","closed_by":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9486/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
