The code that triggers the error is the `_get_plugin_specs_as_list` function that receives a module object instead of a list or a string.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is OS-independent as far as I can tell, but affects only pytest 3.7+ ; pytest 3.6.4 works fine. Also note that the error is *only* triggered when doc-testing the specific subpackage that contains the plugin.\r\n\r\nFor proper context, we have the following directory structure:\r\n```\r\nodl\r\n |\r\n |- util --\r\n |        |- pytest_plugins.py\r\n |        |- ...\r\n | - ...\r\n```\r\nThe error is triggered by `pytest --doctest-modules odl/util`.\r\n\r\nThe full backtrace is [here](https://gist.github.com/kohr-h/0899f6e87262de1f16e409e46f46c1e2).\r\nLink to the subpackage: https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/util\r\n\r\nEdit: Updated pytest versions affected","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3899/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
