What does this do?\r\nThis PR adds a Cloudwatch Target to simplify the usage of [Cloudwatch datasource](https://grafana.com/docs/features/datasources/cloudwatch/).\r\n.\r\n## Why is it a good idea?\r\nThis allows users to use Cloudwatch datasource with specific target (limiting and simplifiying the call) and doesn't interferes with anything else on grafanalib. \r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n- There is no test for this set, I will start working on it ASAP.\r\n- I feel that  hardcoding here the  `validNamespaces` and `validRegions` is not the best approach, but I haven't been able to find any AWS API to gather this information without registering in AWS :( so that's why exists the `checkParams`, with false this will not be updated.\r\n\r\n## Usage example\r\n```\r\nfrom grafanalib.core

However if I use 'Run All Tests' in VSCode, I get the following warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n============================== warnings summary ===============================\r\npythonpracticevenv\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\junitxml.py:436\r\n  c:\\Users\\bjl\\Workspace\\pythonpractice\\pythonpracticevenv\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\junitxml.py:436: PytestDeprecationWarning: The 'junit_family' default value will change to 'xunit2' in pytest 6.0.\r\n  Add 'junit_family=xunit1' to your pytest.ini file to keep the current format in future versions of pytest and silence this warning.\r\n    _issue_warning_captured(deprecated.JUNIT_XML_DEFAULT_FAMILY, config.hook, 2)\r\n\r\n-- Docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html\r\n- generated xml file: C:\\Users\\bjl\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp-18456cj6q2xypP4yi.xml -\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce:\r\n[**NOTE**: Self-contained, minimal reproducing code samples are **extremely** helpful and will expedite addressing your issue]\r\n\r\n1. My file is just test_helloworld.py with following contents:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef helloworld(name='World'):\r\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\r\n\r\n####################################################\r\n\r\ndef test_helloworld_default():\r\n    assert helloworld() == \"Hello, World\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Logs\r\nOutput for `Python` in the `Output` panel (`View`→`Output`, change the drop-down the upper-right of the `Output` panel to `Python`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n> c:\\Users\\bjl\\Workspace\\pythonpractice\\pythonpracticevenv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest --rootdir c:\\Users\\bjl\\Workspace\\pythonpractice --junitxml=C:\\Users\\bjl\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp-18456cj6q2xypP4yi.xml tests\r\ncwd: c:\\Users\\bjl\\Workspace\\pythonpractice\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput from `Console` under the `Developer Tools` panel (toggle Developer Tools on under `Help`; turn on source maps to make any tracebacks be useful by running `Enable source map support for extension debugging`)\r\n\r\n\r\n* This instruction doesn't make sense to me, nonetheless the source of the error is pretty obvious. VSCode is adding the --junitxml flag for its own purposes, it should also supply a value for junit_family in some unobtrusive way. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I will add` junit_family=legacy` in my own pytest.ini to silence the warning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/9709/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/9709/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4607485840,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ2MDc0ODU4NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/4607485840","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"15ba8e89b43c66049ee1da2e09d2d4d81bdcee0f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aragilar/spaceplot/commits/15ba8e89b43c66049ee1da2e09d2d4d81bdcee0f","created_at":"2021-04-17T03:24:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4607544968,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ2MDc1NDQ5Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/4607544968","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6be55b1d4841059b38d9c9110385f84b3c803024","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aragilar/spaceplot/commits/6be55b1d4841059b38d9c9110385f84b3c803024","created_at":"2021-04-17T04:54:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5122738486,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUxMjI3Mzg0ODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/5122738486","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c35cd67e53fb36949b2228a91ed81a6aa5758277","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aragilar/spaceplot/commits/c35cd67e53fb36949b2228a91ed81a6aa5758277","created_at":"2021-08-06T12:52:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
