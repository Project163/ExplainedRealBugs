Documentation\r\n\r\nSome change in Python 3.13 (maybe 5f3433f210d25d366fcebfb40adf444c8f46cd59 or related) allows `pdb.post_mortem()` to accept an exception object, as well as a traceback object. This could be useful to use for chained exception access, for example in Django’s test runner where [a traceback is currently passed](https://github.com/django/django/blob/8d9901c961bf9d5cfa6bddddbbcebfbf487a5125/django/test/runner.py#L124-L129), but the exception with chained causes is available.\r\n\r\nTested

Support changes made in pytest 8.4.0+ for Python 3.13+\n\n`pytest` `8.4.0`, (which shipped on June 2, 2025) included this major change: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12707 - (https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/3cc88d980166e0741f69c00bd7acbb0a245dcaec), which takes advantage of a new feature in Python 3.13 where the `pdb` debugger `interaction` method now accepts both a traceback and an exception (not just the traceback anymore). This has led to an issue with `pdbp`, which hasn't yet made the necessary updates, causing exceptions like the below to occur when running `pytest --pdb` (and there's an exception):\n\n```python\nAttributeError: 'NoSuchElementException' object has no attribute 'tb_frame'\n```\n\nTraceback:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...\n  File \"/Users/michael/.virtualenvs/python_3_13/lib/python3.13/site-packages/_pytest/debugging.py\", line 405, in post_mortem\n    p.interaction(None, tb_or_exc)\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/Users/michael/github/pdbp/src/pdbp.py\", line 297, in interaction\n    ret = self.setup(frame, traceback)\n  File \"/Users/michael/.virtualenvs/python_3_13/lib/python3.13/site-packages/_pytest/debugging.py\", line 221, in setup\n    ret = super().setup(f, tb)\n  File \"/Users/michael/github/pdbp/src/pdbp.py\", line 349, in setup\n    ret = super().setup(frame, tb)\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/pdb.py\", line 391, in setup\n    self.stack, self.curindex = self.get_stack(f, tb)\n                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^\n  File \"/Users/michael/.virtualenvs/python_3_13/lib/python3.13/site-packages/_pytest/debugging.py\", line 230, in get_stack\n    stack, i = super().get_stack(f, t)\n               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^\n  File \"/Users/michael/github/pdbp/src/pdbp.py\", line 377, in get_stack\n    fullstack, idx = super().get_stack(f, t)\n                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/bdb.py\", line 601, in get_stack\n    if t and t.tb_frame is f:\n             ^^^^^^^^^^\nAttributeError: 'AttributeError' object has no attribute 'tb_frame'\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mdmintz/pdbp/issues/77/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mdmintz/pdbp/issues/77/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
