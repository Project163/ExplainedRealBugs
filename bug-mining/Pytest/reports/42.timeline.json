everyone!\r\n\r\nI am experiencing inconsistent behaviour when using async/sync fixtures. Our tests using `pyppeteer` (Python wrapper around Google's Puppeteer library). Almost all `pyppeteer` methods are async. A common code will look like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyppeteer import launch\r\n\r\nbrowser = await launch()\r\npage = await browser.newPage()\r\nawait page.goto('http://example.com')\r\nawait page.screenshot({'path': 'example.png'})\r\nawait browser.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in order to be able to run async tests, I'm using `pytest-asyncio` (and there actually an integration bug between `pytest-asyncio` and `pyppeteer`. A bug was [opened](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/91) on the `pytest-asyncio` that explains the issue). The above share a common code that should get executed before every test:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrowser = await launch()\r\npage = await browser.newPage()\r\n```\r\n\r\nand at the end of each test:\r\n\r\n`await browser.close()`\r\n\r\nSo obviously, a fixture is needed here.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@pytest.fixture()\r\nasync def page():\r\n    browser = await launch()\r\n    page = await browser.newPage()\r\n    yield page\r\n    await browser.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above will work properly if using a normal fixture (like seen in the sftp client example on the official documentation), and while it's a bit confusing yield returns a value and not an iterator - there no problem with using the fixture. But unlike `yield `in a non-async fixture, the yield here will not return the value of `page`, but instead will return an async-generator. So the following test will fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@pytest.mark.asyncio\r\nasync def test_some_test(page)\r\n    await page.goto('http://example.com')\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the following error: `AttributeError: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'goto'`. The only way around it is to manually iterate over async generator so the test will look like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@pytest.mark.asyncio\r\nasync def test_some_test(page)\r\n    async for x in page:\r\n        await page.goto('http://example.com')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt that the right way of doing it? because it seems a bit cumbersome and contradict how yield works on non-async methods.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1796218757,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3OTYyMTg3NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1796218757","actor":{"login":"sfdye","id":1016390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTYzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1016390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye","html_url":"https://github.com/sfdye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfdye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eb8e2a33c8df870cdb8ca19cdd16d7d94831fe20","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django/commits/eb8e2a33c8df870cdb8ca19cdd16d7d94831fe20","created_at":"2018-08-19T05:19:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1797564083,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3OTc1NjQwODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1797564083","actor":{"login":"cmccandless","id":7275238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzUyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccandless","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dfd899a1ef7a8bc03732ca12e4b42d268276ed90","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cmccandless/tools/commits/dfd899a1ef7a8bc03732ca12e4b42d268276ed90","created_at":"2018-08-20T12:44:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1797566779,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3OTc1NjY3Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1797566779","actor":{"login":"cmccandless","id":7275238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzUyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccandless","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccandless/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e319da2068e8f275e1d175b8a4fe23c6b1090495","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cmccandless/multisite/commits/e319da2068e8f275e1d175b8a4fe23c6b1090495","created_at":"2018-08-20T12:45:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1797738117,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3OTc3MzgxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1797738117","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%
