feature request makes sense to me, I think it would be great to allow matching on mark arguments (there are two kinds -- positional and keyword arguments), and something like the function call syntax seems natural for this.\r\n\r\nFor the match expression grammar, it shouldn't pose a big challenge to add. We would need to decide whether the argument values (the `1234` in your example) can be just idents (simple), or more complex, e.g. to support `my_device_under_test(with_serial=1234 or 5678)` etc., which would be more complex.\r\n\r\nThe bigger implementation issue would be the evaluation of the expression. Currently, to optimize the evaluation, we compile the expression to a python AST, then `eval` the AST with an environment (\"locals\") where every ident returns either True (if matches) or False. This will need to be extended to support the function-call syntax. As a quick thought, we could replace the `locals` hack with injecting some `$match` symbol into the `eval` environment which has the form `matcher(name, *args: str, **kwargs: str)` (assuming we only allow idents).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2090713315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2091168835","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281#issuecomment-2091168835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281","id":2091168835,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc58pLRD","user":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-02T17:53:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T17:53:12Z","body":"If

can see the appeal of this, and I agree in theory it makes sense to keep things close to a Python-like syntax.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the same time, I'm also worried this might be a bottomless pit. Where do we stop in terms of types of arguments we support? Allowing `my_device_under_test(with_serial=1234)` or `use_case(\"ABC-1234\")` seems obvious (and would indeed cover things I've seen various companies implement custom arguments/filtering via plugin hooks for).\r\n\r\nHowever, what about, say, enums? Surely there's an argument to be made for enums, as in `size(Size.end2end)`. But then where is `Size` coming from? I'm playing devil's advocate here, but if we allow enums, why wouldn't we also allow, I don't know, custom dataclass instances (in the sense of `device(Multimeter(...))`)? Etc. etc., and then at some point we're back to essentially reimplementing the `eval()` solution we had at some point.\r\n\r\nMaybe though, we could limit this to `int` / `str` / `bool` / `None` or somesuch, or perhaps what [`ast.literal_eval`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval) supports.

cases.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2135186234/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ckutlu","id":6081525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODE1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6081525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu","html_url":"https://github.com/ckutlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckutlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12957476685,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAjwLdc6HmZZDzwAAAAMEU2dN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/12957476685","actor":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-28T13:12:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12957476705,"node_id":"SE_lADOAjwLdc6HmZZDzwAAAAMEU2dh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/12957476705","actor":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-28T13:12:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14886934074,"node_id":"ATPVTE_lADOAjwLdc6HmZZDzwAAAAN3VJY6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/14886934074","actor":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project_v2","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-17T11:20:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15093864587,"n
