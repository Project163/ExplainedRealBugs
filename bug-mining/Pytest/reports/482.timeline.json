for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCloses #12713. \r\n\r\nThe fix for issue #11777 removed any output shortening in the test summary output when `-vv` is used, leading to potentially long/redundant summary messages. The issue in #11777 is also now fully fixed, as series were still condensed in output even with full verbosity.\r\n\r\nSince the removal of the summary shortening has been in place for a while, the addition of a new runtime option seemed to be the best way to address #12713 without changes to existing functionality. `--force-short-summary` was added to always show a shortened summary message regardless of the verbosity setting. Additionally, when using `-vv`, `saferepr_unlimited` is now called to fully resolve #11777.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13061/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16069875366,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc6S8BD8zwAAAAO91tam","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/16069875366","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6c9939b08b23b29da93854b4412ae4e5a17faaf1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kenny-y-dev/pytest/commits/6c9939b08b23b29da93854b4412ae4e5a17faaf1","created_at":"2025-01-26T12:30:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16069943030,"node_id":"CE_lADOAjwLdc6S8BD8zwAAAAO91972","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/16069943030","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-26T12:57:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16069943033,"node_id":"CE_lADOAjwLdc6S8BD8zwAAAAO91975","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/16069943033","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"6c9939b08b23b29da93854b4412ae4e5a17faaf1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/commits/6c9939b08b23b29da93854b4412ae4e5a17faaf1","created_at":"2025-01-26T12:57:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2614439385","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12713#issuecomment-2614439385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12713","id":2614439385,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc6b1S3Z","user":{"login":"ewjoachim","id":1457576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTc1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1457576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewjoachim","html_url":"https://github.com/ewjoachim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewjoachim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.co
