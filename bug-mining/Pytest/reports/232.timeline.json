@atzannes!\r\n\r\nThis was probably introduced in https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/7990, https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/7931, and https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/7929.\r\n\r\nThe fix should be simple: add a `_` in each of the generated fixtures names. \r\n\r\nI did a quick change locally, and it fixes that first case reported:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/_pytest/unittest.py b/src/_pytest/unittest.py\r\nindex 719eb4e88..3f88d7a9e 100644\r\n--- a/src/_pytest/unittest.py\r\n+++ b/src/_pytest/unittest.py\r\n@@

a proper PR, but I'm leaving this in case someone wants to step up. 👍

for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [X] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\n### Problem\r\nThe problem was that the fixtures generated for unittest/xunit/nose were no longer starting with an underscore, and were always listed with `--fixtures`. This broke a unit-test that checked that all the fixtures we wrote have a docstring (because the auto-genned fixtures do not). See #8394 .\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Followed the approach suggested by @nicoddemus in #8394 of just adding an underscore to the name templates where I found them: one for unittest and four for xunit/nose.\r\n\r\n- I wrote a bunch of tests for each case separately and committed the (failing) tests first, followed by the commit that fixes them.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4410233825,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQxMDIzMzgyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/4410233825","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"19a2f7425ddec3b614da7c915e0cf8bb24b6906f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/commits/19a2f7425ddec3b614da7c915e0cf8bb24b6906f","created_at":"2021-03-04T20:45:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6013712086,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc4w-RoozwAAAAFmcfbW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/6013712086","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c8406cdd453e86d45fe5219d2fc311844cbdb9f1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aragilar/stringtopy/commits/c8406cdd453e86d45fe5219d2fc311844cbdb9f1","created_at":"2022-02-05T11:31:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6326311373,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc4w-RoozwAAAAF5E9nN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/6326311373","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8c128a0e0ec702c7742c17fab9b7cbbea108426c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aragilar/pytest-info-collector/commits/8c128a0e0ec702c7742c17fab9b7cbbea108426c","created_at":"2022-03-29T12:44:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6326369016,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc4w-RoozwAAAAF5FLr4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/6326369016","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"http
