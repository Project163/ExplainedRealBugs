(I'm not using a virtual environment.) The application I am testing makes extensive use of gevent. This has worked well until now but today, when refactoring my tests to move the startup/teardown code to a module, I'm getting seg faults.\r\n\r\nI've tried to isolate the issue, and it seems to be something around pytest teardown after the last test in a collection, ie\r\n- running one test by name works\r\n- running all the tests in a file seg faults (after successful completion of all tests)\r\n- running one test by mark also seg faults (after successful completion of that test).\r\n\r\nie\r\n```\r\n$ pytest-3 test_app_cancel_upload.py -m crash_when_marked -v\r\n===================================================================== test session starts ======================================================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.6.5, pytest-3.3.2, py-1.5.2, pluggy-0.6.0 -- /usr/bin/python3\r\ncachedir: ../../.cache\r\nrootdir: /home/mark/dbl-uploader-clients/dbl_dot_local, inifile: pytest.ini\r\nplugins: faulthandler-1.5.0, cov-2.5.1\r\ncollected 5 items                                                                                                                                              \r\n\r\ntest_app_cancel_upload.py::test_cancel_upload_jobs PASSED                                                                                                [100%]\r\n\r\n====================================================================== 4 tests deselected ======================================================================\r\n=========================================================== 1 passed, 4 deselected in 10.47 seconds ============================================================\r\nFatal Python error: Segmentation fault\r\n\r\nCurrent thread 0x00007fe73c7eb740 (most recent call first):\r\nErreur de segmentation (core dumped)\r\n$ pytest-3 test_app_cancel_upload.py::test_cancel_upload_jobs -v\r\n===================================================================== test session starts ======================================================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.6.5, pytest-3.3.2, py-1.5.2, pluggy-0.6.0 -- /usr/bin/python3\r\ncachedir: ../../.cache\r\nrootdir: /home/mark/dbl-uploader-clients/dbl_dot_local, inifile: pytest.ini\r\nplugins: faulthandler-1.5.0, cov-2.5.1\r\ncollected 1 item                                                                                                                                               \r\n\r\ntest_app_cancel_upload.py::test_cancel_upload_jobs PASSED                                                                                                [100%]\r\n\r\n=================================================================== 1 passed in 8.83 seconds ===================================================================\r\n$ \r\n```\r\nThe test above looks like this:\r\n```\r\n@pytest.mark.crash_when_marked\r\n@pytest.mark.cancelUploadJobs\r\ndef test_cancel_upload_jobs(temp_config_path):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Test cancelUploadJobs for host bundle\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    config_ob = Config(prepend_real(temp_config_path))\r\n    du_app = DownUpApp(config_ob, verbose=True)\r\n    #

deprecated.\r\n* Terminal still captures the old `pytest_logwarning` hook to keep displaying warnings issued by `Config.warn` and `Node.warn`. When we remove `Config.warn` and `Node.warn` we are free to mark `pytest_logwarning` for deprecation.\r\n* Due to #2891, I needed to implement a small hack in order to show warnings during the
