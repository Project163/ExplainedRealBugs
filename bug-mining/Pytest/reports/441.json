Ideally, that would only be required if there are conflicts to be solved.\r\n\r\nWould be cool to have a script to prepare a backport PR. Then, as a next step, that could be integrated into GitHub Actions so that the \"needs backport\" label automatically causes a bot to backport the PR to the newest maintenance branch (either when a closed PR is labelled, or when a labelled PR is merged).\r\n\r\nMaybe something suitable exists already, I can't imagine us being the only project who needs something like that. I know the Qt Company has something very similar (after I suggested it to them, though I didn't implement it). Theirs is based on their own CI and Gerrit, though.","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9385/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
