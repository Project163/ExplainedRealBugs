is an initial report of an issue I observed when updating xdoctest to support pytest 8.0. \r\n\r\nWhat I found is that when I ran a test effectivly using the invocation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\Python\\3.12.1\\x64\\python.exe -m pytest C:\\Users\\RUNNER~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpcttcs8zz\r\n```\r\n\r\nPytest would collect 0 tests even though there was a python file with a test in that directory. \r\n\r\nBy adding this code to convert the short path to a long path, the xdoctest failure went away, and things seem to be working now. \r\n\r\n```python\r\ndpath = tempfile.mkdtemp()\r\n# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11420689/how-to-get-long-file-system-path-from-python-on-windows\r\nfrom ctypes import create_unicode_buffer, windll\r\nBUFFER_SIZE = 500\r\nbuffer = create_unicode_buffer(BUFFER_SIZE)\r\nget_long_path_name = windll.kernel32.GetLongPathNameW\r\nget_long_path_name(dpath, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE)\r\ndpath = buffer.value\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've documented more of the problem here https://github.com/Erotemic/xdoctest/issues/151\r\n\r\nI don't have a MWE as I don't have a windows machine, but I'm reasonably confident that something in pytest 8 broke short path recognition on windows. I'll leave it to other devs to test further.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11895/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
