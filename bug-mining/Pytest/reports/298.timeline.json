I appreciate where you are coming from, but I don't think this is a good idea:\r\n\r\n* It is somewhat implicit to me that returning `False` from a test function would cause the test to fail. Also, it would fail with what message? `assert` statements are the bread and butter of tests in pytest after all.\r\n* I've seen many times users using plain `return` to stop a test in the middle of the execution (for example, in a parametrized test one of the parameters only goes through the middle of the test). This would cause those test suites to fail.\r\n\r\nSo while I see that a few users might get confused by that, I don't think it is common enough to create a special case for it and also possibly breaking backward compatibility, so 👎 from me.\r\n\r\nThis is also a good opportunity to advocate users to see their tests fail first before fixing code, to ensure they are not testing a false positive.\r\n\r\nBut again, thanks for the suggestion and taking the time to write about it.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/640819782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3421620863,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQyMTYyMDg2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/3421620863","actor":{"login":"maxrothman","id":2607086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDcwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2607086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman","html_url":"https://github.com/maxrothman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-08T19:15:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3421620867,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0MjE2MjA4Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/3421620867","actor":{"login":"maxrothman","id":2607086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDcwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2607086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman","html_url":"https://github.com/maxrothman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-08T19:15:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/640903636","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7337#issuecomment-640903636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7337","id":640903636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDkwMzYzNg==","user":{"login":"maxrothman","id":2607086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDcwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2607086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman","html_url":"https://github.com/maxrothman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxrothman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"crea

+1 on this - in fact Hypothesis already makes non-`None` returns from wrapped tests into errors.\r\n\r\n- it catches some trivial user errors, as noted in the OP\r\n- more importantly, it also catches problems like definining generators as tests (or async test functions), where calling the function doesn't actually execute the test body.  On this basis we could e.g. explicitly recommend `pytest-asyncio` or `pytest-trio` if an awaitable object is returned.\r\n\r\nI'd probably do this as a warning to start with, have an option to disable the warning, and then upgrade it to an error (still disabled by the same option) in pytest
