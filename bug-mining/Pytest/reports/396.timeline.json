This is correct in the sense that each test **function** is associated by a single unique temporary directory.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not correct when considering running **the same test function concurrently** by distinct pytest invocations. We are doing this all the time using Tox where tests are executed from multiple virtualenvs (different Python versions), concurrently.\r\n\r\nIn that scenario, the `tmp_path` generated directory is shared/clashes between multiple invocations.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that the solution is to uniqueify the temp path prefix, similar to what the `pytest-xdist` extension does. With Tox, that is trivial to achieve.
