`request.cached_setup` and `Metafunc.addcall`.\r\n\r\nFix #4489, #3083\r\n\r\nA note: I had to remove some tests because `Metafunc.addcall` can combine arguments in multiple levels of `pytest_generate_tests` hooks, while `Metafunc.parametrize` specifically has a check against that. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def test_generate_plugin_and_module(self, testdir):\r\n        testdir.makeconftest(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n                assert \"arg1\" in metafunc.fixturenames\r\n                metafunc.addcall(id=\"world\", param=(2,100))\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        )\r\n        p = testdir.makepyfile(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n                metafunc.addcall(param=(1,1), id=\"hello\")\r\n\r\n            import pytest\r\n            @pytest.fixture\r\n            def arg1(request):\r\n                return request.param[0]\r\n            @pytest.fixture\r\n            def arg2(request):\r\n                return request.param[1]\r\n\r\n            class TestClass(object):\r\n                def test_myfunc(self, arg1, arg2):\r\n                    assert arg1 == arg2\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        )\r\n        result = testdir.runpytest(\"-v\", p, SHOW_PYTEST_WARNINGS_ARG)\r\n        result.stdout.fnmatch_lines(\r\n            [\r\n                \"*test_myfunc*hello*PASS*\",\r\n                \"*test_myfunc*world*FAIL*\",\r\n                \"*1 failed, 1 passed*\",\r\n            ]\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen converted to use `metafunc.parametrize`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def test_generate_plugin_and_module(self, testdir):\r\n        testdir.makeconftest(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n                assert \"arg1\" in metafunc.fixturenames\r\n                metafunc.parametrize('arg1, arg2', [(2, 100)], ids=[\"world\"])\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        )\r\n        p = testdir.makepyfile(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n                metafunc.parametrize('arg1, arg2', [(1, 1)], ids=[\"hello\"])    \r\n\r\n            class TestClass(object):\r\n                def test_myfunc(self, arg1, arg2):\r\n                    assert arg1 == arg2\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        )\r\n        result = testdir.runpytest(\"-v\", p, SHOW_PYTEST_WARNINGS_ARG)\r\n        result.stdout.fnmatch_lines(\r\n            [\r\n                \"*test_myfunc*hello*PASS*\",\r\n                \"*test_myfunc*world*FAIL*\",\r\n                \"*1 failed, 1 passed*\",\r\n            ]\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe get this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: duplicate 'arg1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is fine, as users who might still rely on `cached_setup`'s behavior would have probably complain by now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/443482048","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4489#issuecomment-443482048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4489","id":443482048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzQ4MjA0OA==","user":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-02T05:04:24Z","updated_at":"2018-12-02T05:04:24Z","body":"via
