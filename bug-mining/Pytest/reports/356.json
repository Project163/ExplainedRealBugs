To do so, I've needed to switch to `importlib` for the `import-mode` and re-organize the tests to avoid import errors on the tests.\r\n\r\nYet even after working around these issues, the tests are failing when the effect of `core.initialize()` doesn't seem to have had any effect.\r\n\r\nInvestigating deeper, I see that initializer is executed and performs its actions (setting a class variable `pmxbot.logging.Logger.store`), but when that happens, there are two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` present, one in `sys.modules` and another found in `tests.unit.test_commands.logging`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n=========================================================================== test session starts ===========================================================================\r\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.11.1, pytest-7.2.0, pluggy-1.0.0\r\ncachedir: .tox/python/.pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: /Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot, configfile: pytest.ini\r\nplugins: black-0.3.12, mypy-0.10.3, jaraco.test-5.3.0, checkdocs-2.9.0, flake8-1.1.1, enabler-2.0.0, jaraco.mongodb-11.2.1, pmxbot-1122.14.3.dev13+g7f189ad\r\ncollected 421 items / 180 deselected / 241 selected                                                                                                                       \r\nrun-last-failure: rerun previous 240 failures (skipped 14 files)\r\n\r\ntests/unit/test_commands.py E\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> traceback >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\ncls = <class 'tests.unit.test_commands.TestCommands'>\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def setup_class(cls):\r\n        path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\r\n        configfile = os.path.join(path, 'testconf.yaml')\r\n        config = pmxbot.dictlib.ConfigDict.from_yaml(configfile)\r\n        cls.bot = core.initialize(config)\r\n>       logging.Logger.store.message(\"logged\", \"testrunner\", \"some text\")\r\nE       AttributeError: type object 'Logger' has no attribute 'store'\r\n\r\ntests/unit/test_commands.py:37: AttributeError\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> entering PDB >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> PDB post_mortem (IO-capturing turned off) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n> /Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/tests/unit/test_commands.py(37)setup_class()\r\n-> logging.Logger.store.message(\"logged\", \"testrunner\", \"some text\")\r\n(Pdb) logging.Logger\r\n<class 'pmxbot.logging.Logger'>\r\n(Pdb) logging\r\n<module 'pmxbot.logging' from '/Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/pmxbot/logging.py'>\r\n(Pdb) import sys\r\n(Pdb) sys.modules['pmxbot.logging']\r\n<module 'pmxbot.logging' from '/Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/pmxbot/logging.py'>\r\n(Pdb) sys.modules['pmxbot.logging'] is logging\r\nFalse\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't yet made a minimal reproducer, but I wanted to first capture this condition.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
