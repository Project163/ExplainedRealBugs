Mainly this is because subscripted generic types (see PEP 484 for definition of terms used in this PEP) are class objects (see also [1])\r\n\r\nSo much that they have made it [7 times faster](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html) in Python 3.7:\r\n\r\n> As a result of PEP 560 work, the import time of typing has been reduced by a factor of 7, and many typing operations are now faster.\r\n\r\nI would rather use just the comments instead of adding yet another dependency which slows down pytest startup.
