`Token.Text.Whitespace`, and seems to be adjusting lexers to emit those rather than just `Text`:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/pygments/pygments/issues/1905\r\n\r\nNot sure why our style/formatter then decides to highlight that in \"bright black\" since it's space anyways, but from what I understand, Pygments isn't doing anything wrong here and we probably just need to adjust our expected

Since parameter values do not always speak for themselves, the test function + test ID are often not descriptive/expressive.\r\n\r\nAllowing parameter name=value pairs in the test ID optionally to get an idea what parameters a test gets passed is beneficial. So add a kwarg `id_names` to `@pytest.mark.parametrize()` / `pytest.Metafunc.parametrize()`. It defaults to `False` to keep the auto-generated ID as before.
