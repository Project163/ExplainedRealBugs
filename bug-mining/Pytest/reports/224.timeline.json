@PhilippSelenium,\r\n\r\nThat's due to https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/7854: we introduced `Pytester`, and because `Testdir` and `Pytester` both have the same interface, we decided to show the members of `Pytester` in the docs only: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#pytest.pytester.Pytester. \r\n\r\nHowever thinking about this a bit more I'm not sure this is ideal: `Pytester` now will tend to gain extra functionality which we don't plan to backport to `Testdir` (I think at least), so we really should show members of both classes in the docs.\r\n\r\nAlso notice that your link points to the \"latest\" docs, which are actually `master`, for version 6.1.1 you should use https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/objects.inv instead, which still contain the intersphinx docs for `Testdir`.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/707770354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3871604167,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg3MTYwNDE2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/3871604167","actor":{"login":"PhilippSelenium","id":31542906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTQyOTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31542906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippSelenium","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-13T14:17:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3871604173,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4NzE2MDQxNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/3871604173","actor":{"login":"PhilippSelenium","id":31542906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTQyOTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31542906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippSelenium","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSelenium/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-13T14:17:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3871605195,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM4NzE2MDUxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/3871605195","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":n
