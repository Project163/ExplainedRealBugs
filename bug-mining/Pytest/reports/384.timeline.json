Problem Statement\r\n\r\n**What's the problem this feature will solve?**\r\nThe current behavior of pytest in handling duplicated values in parametrize can lead to confusion regarding the actual parameter values used in tests. This PR aims to address this issue by providing clear and unambiguous parameter identifiers.\r\n\r\n[maintainer edit to [link the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue): fixes #11456]\r\n\r\n## Solution Description\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution involves modifying the `make_unique_parameterset_ids` method in the `Python.py` class. This change will ensure that unique identifiers are generated for ParameterSets, eliminating any confusion caused by duplicated values.\r\n\r\n- When a parameter identifier ends in a digit, a new identifier will be generated in the format `\"{id}_{suffix}\"`, where `suffix` is a numeric counter.\r\n- If the new identifier is already present in the set of resolved identifiers, the counter will be incremented until a unique identifier is obtained.\r\n- This approach guarantees the uniqueness of identifiers, even when the original identifiers have digit endings.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pllim","id":2090236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTAyMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2090236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim","html_url":"https://github.com/pllim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pllim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-27T20:04:33Z","updated_at":"2023-10-27T20:04:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astropy/astropy/issues/15548","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astropy/astropy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astropy/astropy/issues/15548/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astropy/astropy/issues/15548/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astropy/astropy/issues/15548/events","html_url":"https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/15548","id":1966041591,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAB_CCc5eAC9-","number":15548,"title":"pytest
