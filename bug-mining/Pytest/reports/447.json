For fixtures that are parametrized using strings (and potentially other parameter types) this has caused strange (read: unexpected) behavior where fixtures are recreated when the user would expect them to be cached and re-used. Since re-use of expensive-to-set-up fixtures is precisely why fixtures exists, I believe this is bug and that the change above should be reverted or at least adapted.\r\n\r\nThis bug obviously doesn't affect pytest versions without the commit d282424589772905426529e79fb653044b6152fb; i.e. pytest < 5.4.0.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\nThe behavior described above can be illustrated by the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\n\r\ndef pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n\tif \"my_fixture\" in metafunc.fixturenames:\r\n\t\tparam = \"d%s\" % \"1\"\r\n\t\tprint(\"\\nparam id=%d\" % id(param), flush=True)\r\n\t\tmetafunc.parametrize(\"my_fixture\", [param, \"d2\"], indirect=True)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@pytest.fixture(scope='session')\r\ndef my_fixture(request):\r\n\tprint(\"Setting up fixture scope=session \", end='')\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test1(my_fixture):\r\n\tpass\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test2(my_fixture):\r\n\tpass\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of running this with pyrest 5.4.1 is:\r\n```\r\n$ pytest -v -s test_pytest.py\r\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.6.8, pytest-5.4.1, py-1.8.1, pluggy-0.13.1 -- <redacted path>\r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: <redacted path>\r\nplugins: testinfra-3.2.0, custom-exit-code-0.3.0, flaky-3.6.1, ordering-0.6, container-tests-1.0\r\ncollecting ...\r\nparam id=4409052776\r\n\r\nparam id=4408955544\r\ncollected 4 items\r\n\r\ntest_pytest.py::test1[d1] Setting up fixture scope=session PASSED\r\ntest_pytest.py::test2[d1] Setting up fixture scope=session PASSED\r\ntest_pytest.py::test1[d2] Setting up fixture scope=session PASSED\r\ntest_pytest.py::test2[d2] PASSED\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how the fixture is created 3 times and not 2 times.\r\n\r\nNow compare this with the following slightly modified code (the only difference is the way the value of `param` is created in `pytest_generate_tests `):\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\n\r\ndef pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n\tif \"my_fixture\" in metafunc.fixturenames:\r\n\t\tparam = \"d1\"\r\n\t\tprint(\"\\nparam id=%d\" % id(param), flush=True)\r\n\t\tmetafunc.parametrize(\"my_fixture\", [param, \"d2\"], indirect=True)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@pytest.fixture(scope='session')\r\ndef my_fixture(request):\r\n\tprint(\"Setting up fixture scope=session \", end='')\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test1(my_fixture):\r\n\tpass\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test2(my_fixture):\r\n\tpass\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npytest -v -s  test_pytest.py\r\n================================================================================================ test session starts =================================================================================================\r\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.6.8, pytest-5.4.1, py-1.8.1, pluggy-0.13.1 -- <redacted path>\r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: <redacted path>\r\nplugins: testinfra-3.2.0, custom-exit-code-0.3.0, flaky-3.6.1, ordering-0.6, container-tests-1.0\r\ncollecting ...\r\nparam id=4583559776\r\n\r\nparam id=4583559776\r\ncollected 4 items\r\n\r\ntest_pytest.py::test1[d1] Setting up fixture scope=session PASSED\r\ntest_pytest.py::test2[d1] PASSED\r\ntest_pytest.py::test1[d2] Setting up fixture scope=session PASSED\r\ntest_pytest.py::test2[d2] PASSED\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how the fixture is now, as one would expected, instantiated only twice.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nI think it's dangerous to use `is` to compare the values of objects since it compares addresses, as illustrated above. Using `is` might be the right thing to do for Numpy arrays but not for the general case. As a result I suggest reverting the change https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/d282424589772905426529e79fb653044b6152fb, maybe using `is` to compare Numpy arrays specifically and continuing to use `__eq__` for all other objects.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6962/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
