However, there is another one: [`FutureWarning`][FutureWarning]. This particular warning is used by packages such as [`pydeprecate`][pydeprecate] as the default warning for any functions that will be removed in the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I write a function that raises the [`FutureWarning`][FutureWarning] (or use the [`@deprecated`][pydeprecate] decorator), then [`deprecated_call()`][deprecated_call] currently does not catch the test successfully.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'd like to add [`FutureWarning`][FutureWarning] to the list of warnings which are captured by [`deprecated_call()`][deprecated_call].\r\n\r\nThis is the current behaviour:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom warnings import warn\r\nfrom pytest import deprecated_call\r\n\r\ndef deprecated_func():\r\n    warn(\"This function is deprecated\", DeprecationWarning)\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ndef future_deprecation_func():\r\n    warn(\"This function will be deprecated in the future\", FutureWarning)\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ndef test_deprecated():\r\n    \"\"\"Expected to pass\"\"\"\r\n    with deprecated_call():\r\n        deprecated_func()\r\n\r\ndef test_futures():\r\n    \"\"\"Expected to fail\"\"\"\r\n    with deprecated_call():\r\n        future_deprecation_func()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour would be for both of these two test cases to pass successfully.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Solutions\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n[DeprecationWarning]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning\r\n[PendingDeprecationWarning]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PendingDeprecationWarning\r\n[FutureWarning]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FutureWarning\r\n[pydeprecate]: https://borda.github.io/pyDeprecate/\r\n[deprecated_call]: https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/reference/reference.html#pytest.deprecated_call","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
