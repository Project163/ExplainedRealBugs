@cjw296!\r\n\r\nThe problem was introduced by fixing #2127: to obtain the correct \"hook proxy\" to call `pytest_fixture_setup` and `pytest_fixture_post_finalizer` we need to access `request.node.fpsath`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/88ed1ab64857c42a2509ed1eea1bf3f13ebd797e/_pytest/fixtures.py#L787-L791\r\n\r\nPreviously it would always access the global hook (skipping trying to access `request.node`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/a220a40350a8a81c0f0e1986aa184e4c33da29d6/_pytest/fixtures.py#L788-L792\r\n\r\n The problem is that `request.node` explodes because `SybilItem.getparent` returns `None` when passed a `Session` class (currently it only handles `Module`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cjw296/sybil/blob/ec1572d36ea65a1320277107ad9a583bd259ba95/sybil/integration/pytest.py#L56-L58\r\n\r\nI opened cjw296/sybil#5 with a quick fix for this.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nThis demonstrates how hard is to extend the pytest internals because we don't have clear interfaces and documentation to what's needed to extend the internal classes properly.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, it seems harsh that we have an `assert node` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/88ed1ab64857c42a2509ed1eea1bf3f13ebd797e/_pytest/fixtures.py#L548-L557\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better to raise an exception explaining the problem?\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems to me that this code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nhook = self._fixturemanager.session.gethookproxy(request.node.fspath)\r\nreturn hook.pytest_fixture_setup(fixturedef=self, request=request)\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould use `request.fspath` instead of `request.node.fspath`, but then it gives this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest setup failed\r\nself = <SubRequest 'fix' for <Function 'test_fo'>>\r\n\r\n    def provide(self):\r\n        if func.__name__ in scope2props[self.scope]:\r\n            return func(self)\r\n        raise AttributeError(\"%s not available in %s-scoped context\" % (\r\n>           scopename, self.scope))\r\nE       AttributeError: fspath not available in session-scoped context\r\n\r\n..\\_pytest\\fixtures.py:57: AttributeError\r\n```\r\n\r\nShouldn't `request.fspath` be essentially the same as `request.node.fspath`? What do you think
