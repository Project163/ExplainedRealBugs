`--strict-marks` in the documentation and examples;\r\n* Remove the various marks that are used through testing: `foo`, `bar`, multiple spellings of parametrize, etc.\r\n* After the above, we should try to get rid of `UnknownMarksWarning` in favor of `PytestWarning`; if not, we should then create more subclasses of `PytestWarning` for the other warnings emitted by pytest.\r\n* Add integration
