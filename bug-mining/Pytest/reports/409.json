The next \"category\" that seems to stand out based on the [current behavior](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11387#issuecomment-1729291056) is how `pytest` displays test cases are it executes them. By this I mean the distinction between:\r\n\r\n\r\n`--quiet`\r\n```\r\n.................................................................................
