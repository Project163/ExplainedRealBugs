At the same time, other log file messages not generated by pytest print sub-second datetimestamps, e.g. `2023-05-11T13:45:34.123`.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the various logs, there are many message from other system components that are printing many log messages per second. Because pytest log messages are lacking sub-second precision, I am unable to align pytest log messages within other system log messages.\r\n\r\n#### contrived example\r\n\r\nFor example, the system-under-test generates a log file like:\r\n```text\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.001 starting the frobulator\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.100 wiggling the waggulator\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.200 stopping the frobulator\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.301 starting the frobulator\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.400 poking the prokulator\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.450 prokulator response ERROR_NOT_ONLINE\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.500 stopping the frobulator\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.600 starting the frobulator\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.700 juggling some bowling pins\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.750 DROPPED A PIN!\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.800 stopping the frobulator\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34.839 ERROR 0x0F009001 STOPPING THE frobulator\r\n```\r\nand the driver of tests, pytest, generates a log file like:\r\n```text\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34 checking device\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34 ping device\r\n2023-05-11T13:45:34 device error!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe pytest log messages cannot be precisely ordered among the other log messages that occurred during the datetime second `2023-05-11T13:45:34`, there were many things that occurred in the other system components within that second.\r\n\r\n#### current confusion\r\n\r\nGiven the following pytest code\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport logging\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\nlogging.basicConfig()\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\r\n\r\ndef test_logger():\r\n    logger.error(\"test_logger()ERROR\")\r\n    logger.warning(\"test_logger()WARNING\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo add sub-second granularity, it seems sensible to add `%f` within the `--log-cli-date-format`\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ python -m pytest \\\r\n         -v -v \\\r\n         --log-cli-date-format=\"%Y%m%dT%H%M%S.%f\" \\\r\n         --capture=tee-sys \\\r\n         -k \"test_logger\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut then I see the confusing output of\r\n\r\n```text\r\n20230511T181007.%f: ERROR : [test_main.py:27 - test_logger()] : test_logger()ERROR\r\n20230511T181007.%f: WARNING : [test_main.py:28 - test_logger()] : test_logger()WARNING\r\n```\r\n\r\npytest logging is ignoring the strftime `%f` specifier!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### pytest feature request\r\n\r\nI want pytest log messages to print sub-second granularity, e.g. process strftime `%f` within `--log-date-format=\"...%f...\"` settings.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\nSupport strftime `%f` specifier in the various settings for _date-format_, e.g. `--log-date-format`, `--log-cli-date-format`, `--log-file-date-format`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable and how it solves the problem described above. -->\r\n\r\nIn my complex testing system, this means _all_ log messages would be printed to millisecond precision. This allows engineers investigating issues to more accurately merge disparate testing system logs by their natural ordering mechanism of a datetimestamp.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Alternative Solutions\r\n\r\n<!-- Have you tried to workaround the problem using a pytest plugin or other tools? Or a different approach to solving this issue? Please elaborate here. -->\r\n\r\nI can set the `logging` format to include `%(msecs)03d`.\r\nHowever, it's a little confusing to have to manipulate log datetimestamps by two different mechanisms, `--log-cli-format` and `--log-cli-date-format`.\r\n\r\n#### example workaround\r\n\r\nOn the command-line run:\r\n```text\r\n$ python -m pytest \\\r\n         -v -v \\\r\n         --log-cli-date-format=\"%Y%m%dT%H%M%S.\" \\\r\n         --log-cli-format=\"%(asctime)s%(msecs)03d: %(levelname)s : [%(filename)s:%(lineno)s - %(funcName)s()] : %(message)s\" \\\r\n         --capture=tee-sys \\\r\n         -k \"test_logger\"\r\n```\r\nThis prints datetimestamps with millisecond precision\r\n```text\r\n20230511T180748.192: ERROR : [test_main.py:27 - test_logger()] : test_logger()ERROR\r\n20230511T180748.195: WARNING : [test_main.py:28 - test_logger()] : test_logger()WARNING\r\n```\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nIt is more intuitive for pytest to process the Python strftime `%f` specifier within all `--*-date-format` options.","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
