Both the [how-to](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/how-to/capture-warnings.html#warns) and the [reference](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/reference/reference.html#pytest.warns) say:\r\n\r\n> [...] the keyword argument `match` to assert that the warning matches a text or regex:\r\n\r\nand show a rather confusing example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith warns(UserWarning, match='must be 0 or None'):\r\n    warnings.warn(\"value must be 0 or None\", UserWarning)\r\n\r\nwith warns(UserWarning, match=r'must be \\d+$'):\r\n    warnings.warn(\"value must be 42\", UserWarning)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been fixed for `pytest.raises` in 8b34d981fc378f06b65d0866e6bd2c66d29680b3 for #5208, looks like we should do a very similar change for `pytest.warns` as well.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1361283378/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8087074849,"node_id":"LE_lADOAjwLdc5ZwAiUzwAAAAHiBvgh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/8087074849","actor":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-21T12:59:27Z","label":{"name":"type:
