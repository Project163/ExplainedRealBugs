Problem\r\n\r\n- When running `pytest a/b/c.py`, the `.`, `a` and `a/b` directories or packages are collected as part of building the collection tree.\r\n- When a directory is collected, it collects all files/dirs in it, including ones that will be filtered out, e.g. `a/mysecretdir` (the filtering happens separately later).\r\n- In the python.py plugin's `pytest_collect_directory` hookimpl, we are checking if `a/mysecretdir` is a `Package` by checking whether it contains an `__init__.py` file.\r\n- If the user doesn't have rx permission on `a/mysecretdir`, the collection fails, even though the user didn't select this directory at all.\r\n\r\nWe've had a bunch of issues about this, as far as I can see the issue mainly comes up in these two scenarios:\r\n\r\n- Users collecting a test in `/tmp`, which often has non-user-owned dirs. I think doing this is a bad idea -- some other user can drop a conftest.py file and execute stuff as the pytest user -- but who am I to judge.\r\n\r\n- Some Docker or such tool leaving root or service-user owned files in the project directory.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nI don't have a great proper solution, so for now I suggest we catch `PermissionError` in the `pytest_collect_directory` for `Package`s, and say it's not a package if so. This means it will be collected as a `Dir`. I think this is fine:\r\n\r\n- If the directory is selected, it will still fail a bit later when trying to run `collect()` on the `Dir` node. This is good, we want it to fail if it's actually selected.\r\n- If the directory is not selected, then it doesn't matter anyway.\r\n\r\nOK, so the last point is not 100% right, it might matter if a plugin hooks into the right place etc. That's why I'm not intellectually satisfied with this solution. But practicality beats purity, and practically I don't think anyone will ever notice.\r\n\r\n### Rejected Solution\r\n\r\nBefore pytest 8, the problem didn't happen because directory collection was \"centralized\" in `Session` which did the filtering *during* the collection. In pytest 8 we delegated the collection to the `Directory` nodes (`Dir`/`Package` are the built-in concrete ones).\r\n\r\nThe new scheme is IMO simpler and more pytest-y, and it unlocked further simplifications and optimizations (mostly around conftest loading), and also custom directory node support. So I don't think we want to go back.\r\n\r\nPossibly there's a way to keep the new scheme but also delegate the filtering, thus fixing the problem properly. If a future human or machine reads this and comes up with a proposal to do this, that'd be cool

collection.</li>\n<li>[#12300](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12300): Fixed handling of 'Function not implemented' error under squashfuse_ll, which is a different way to say that the mountpoint is read-only.</li>\n<li>[#12308](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12308): Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where the permissions of automatically-created <code>.pytest_cache</code> directories became <code>rwx------</code> instead of the expected <code>rwxr-xr-x</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Trivial/Internal Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[#12333](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12333): pytest releases are now attested using the recent [Artifact

artifacts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>8.2.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.2.0 (2024-04-27)</h1>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#12069](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069): A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated <code>py.path.local</code> parameter instead of the <code>pathlib.Path</code> parameter which replaced it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pytest_ignore_collect</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>collection_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_collect_file</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>file_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_pycollect_makemodule</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>module_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_header</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_collectionfinish</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.\nThe old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.</p>\n<p>See <code>legacy-path-hooks-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#11871](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871): Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character <code>@</code>, like e.g.: <code>pytest @tests.txt</code>.
