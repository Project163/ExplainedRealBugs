This is sometimes undesirable with projects that have a lot of xfail-ing tests. For example, with pandas outputting XFAIL tracebacks takes a few minutes and results in 80M of output.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI think the cleanest solution would be to have another option to control whether tracebacks are displayed for XFAILs. This would make it possible to retain XFAIL in summary output (via `-rx` or `-ra`), without the extra overhead of printing all the tracebacks.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Solutions\r\nWe could avoid passing `-rx`, but then we'd lose the list of XFAILs from test summary, and that one is actually desirable.\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\nn/a","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
