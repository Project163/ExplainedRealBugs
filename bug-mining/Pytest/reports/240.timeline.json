@elbehery95, \r\n\r\nSorry for the delay, and thanks for the report!\r\n\r\nWe can reproduce this even without a second config file, we get the same (incorrect) behavior with these invocations:\r\n\r\n* `pytest tests/`  (works)\r\n* `pytest tests/ -c pytest.ini`  (fails)\r\n\r\nOf course the two runs should be identical.\r\n\r\nThe problem is in the `determine_setup` function:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/41a90cd9fef26a5d7bcd89990dd0594b0d3f6a14/src/_pytest/config/findpaths.py#L166-L171\r\n\r\nIt should return the same results if `inifile` is `None` or `\"pytest.ini\"`, but currently it returns a different `rootdir` in the latter case.\r\n\r\nThis should be simple to fix, as you can easily unittest `determine_setup`.\r\n\r\n> Was wondering if anyone is working on this and if someone found a cause for this?\r\n\r\nNobody seems to be working on this currently, feel free to tackle it. 👍
