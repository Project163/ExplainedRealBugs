I like `TopRequest`, it is easy to explain its meaning when in conjunction with `SubRequest`. \r\n\r\n> As an initial way to clarify things a bit, I propose making FixtureRequest itself abstract, and add a new TopRequest subclass for the test-function request.\r\n\r\nAnd `SubRequest` would no longer subclass `FixtureRequest`/`TopRequest`, just implement the abstract class?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just saw
