for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [X] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [X] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs described in #12300 , pytest crashes with `OSError: [Errno 38] Function not implemented` when it's run under a squashfuse_ll mountpoint. the exception comes from within\r\n```\r\n_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py:1102: in try_makedirs\r\n    os.makedirs(cache_dir, exist_ok=True)\r\n```\r\nthis is because squashfuse_ll returns `ENOSYS` instead of `EROFS` for a read-only filesystem, which pytest doesn't know how to handle.  This change adds handling of the error code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses #12300

[pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) from 8.1.1 to 8.2.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from [pytest's

Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[#12120](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12120): Fix [PermissionError]{.title-ref} crashes arising from directories which are not selected on the

collection.</li>\n<li>[#12300](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12300): Fixed handling of 'Function not implemented' error under squashfuse_ll, which is a different way to say that the mountpoint is read-only.</li>\n<li>[#12308](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12308): Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where the permissions of automatically-created <code>.pytest_cache</code> directories became <code>rwx------</code> instead of the expected <code>rwxr-xr-x</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Trivial/Internal Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[#12333](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12333): pytest releases are now attested using the recent [Artifact Attestation](https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/) support from GitHub, allowing users to verify the provenance of pytest's sdist and wheel artifacts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>8.2.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.2.0 (2024-04-27)</h1>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#12069](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069): A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated <code>py.path.local</code> parameter instead of the <code>pathlib.Path</code> parameter which replaced it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pytest_ignore_collect</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>collection_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_collect_file</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>file_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_pycollect_makemodule</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>module_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_header</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_collectionfinish</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.\nThe old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.</p>\n<p>See <code>legacy-path-hooks-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#11871](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871): Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character <code>@</code>, like e.g.: <code>pytest @tests.txt</code>. The file must have one argument per line.</p>\n<p>See <code>Read arguments from file &lt;args-from-file&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Improvements</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
