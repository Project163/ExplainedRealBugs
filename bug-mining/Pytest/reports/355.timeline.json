initial implementation (in #7246) introduced the `importlib` mode, which never added the imported module to `sys.modules`, so it included a test to ensure calling `import_path` twice would yield different modules.\r\n\r\nNot adding modules to `sys.modules` proved problematic, so we began to add the imported module to `sys.modules` in #7870, but failed to realize that given we are now changing `sys.modules`, we might as well avoid importing it more than once.\r\n\r\nThen #10088 came along, passing `importlib` also when importing application modules to collect docstrings (as opposed to only test modules before), which caused problems due to imports having side-effects and the expectation being that they are imported only once.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, `import_path` returns the module
