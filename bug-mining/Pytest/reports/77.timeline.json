some usage errors produce very ugly traceback with pytest's internals. For example, mistyping the `scope` of a fixture produces this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n============================================= ERRORS ==============================================\r\n_____________________________ ERROR collecting test-scope-mismatch.py _____________________________\r\nsrc\\_pytest\\fixtures.py:699: in scope2index\r\n    return scopes.index(scope)\r\nE   ValueError: 'modu' is not in list\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\nsrc\\_pytest\\runner.py:201: in __init__\r\n    self.result = func()\r\nsrc\\_pytest\\runner.py:265: in <lambda>\r\n    call = CallInfo(lambda: list(collector.collect()), \"collect\")\r\nsrc\\_pytest\\python.py:475: in collect\r\n    self.session._fixturemanager.parsefactories(self)\r\nsrc\\_pytest\\fixtures.py:1321: in parsefactories\r\n    ids=marker.ids,\r\nsrc\\_pytest\\fixtures.py:837: in __init__\r\n    scope or \"function\", descr=\"fixture {}\".format(func.__name__), where=baseid\r\nsrc\\_pytest\\fixtures.py:703: in scope2index\r\n    descr, \"from {} \".format(where) if where else \"\", scope\r\nE   ValueError: fixture fix from test-scope-mismatch.py has an unsupported scope value 'modu'\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This way we can raise that exception on errors that we know are usage problems and where displaying the entire traceback is not helpful in general. With this PR the error above produces this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n============================================= ERRORS ==============================================\r\n_____________________________ ERROR collecting test-scope-mismatch.py _____________________________\r\nfixture fix from test-scope-mismatch.py has an unsupported scope value 'modu'\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Is this approach sound?\r\n2. Should we use `UsageError` or create a new type of exception? Should it be public so plugins can use it too?\r\n3.
