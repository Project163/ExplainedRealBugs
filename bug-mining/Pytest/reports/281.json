I could swear I also saw another project in #9415 fail after fixing the initial issue it had, but then Christmas and stuff came along and now I don't remember which one it was, and of course can't find it anymore.\r\n\r\nA (quite) [rough search](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+%28testdir%7Cpytester%29%5C..*-k+lang:python+-file:.*/%3Ftesting/%28test_terminal%7Cacceptance_test%7Ctest_runner%7Ctest_collection%7Ctest_pytester%7Ctest_debugging%7Ctest_mark%7Cdeprecated_test%7Ctest_terminal%7Cpython/%29.*+-repo:pytest-dev/pytest-bdd&patternType=regexp) reveals that more projects might be affected by this (excludes to avoid matches in copies of pytest's source code).\r\n\r\nSome examples I could dig up (but haven't verified):\r\n\r\n- [test_parametrization.py - schemathesis/schemathesis - Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/-/blob/test/test_parametrization.py?L445:14)\r\n- [test_ipa_run_tests.py - freeipa/freeipa - Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/freeipa/freeipa/-/blob/ipatests/test_ipatests_plugins/test_ipa_run_tests.py?L117:17) (maybe)\r\n- [test_parametrized.py - pytest-dev/pytest-play - Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-play/-/blob/tests/test_parametrized.py?L94:14)\r\n\r\nI think the change in itself makes sense, but at the same time fixes like https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/470 are a bit cumbersome.\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n\r\n- What should we do about this for 7.0? (even if the answer just is \"live with it and document it as backwards-incompatible in the changelog)\r\n- What (if anything) should we do about this so that it doesn't happen again for future releases? I guess not much we can do, as long as we want to assume 0 for outcomes which have not been given...","closed_by":{"login":"The-Compiler","id":625793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Compiler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Compiler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
