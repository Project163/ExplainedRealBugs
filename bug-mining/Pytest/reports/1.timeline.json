I guess that's a little harsh, perhaps the ideal would be to make the `<1.5` restriction valid only for `py26` and `py33` I guess. This can still cause havoc on those platforms, but I'm sure the affected users will be much fewer.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we might remove the restriction in `pytest` completely and let `py` declare `python_requires` instead.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/344440576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1342029269,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTM0MjAyOTI2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1342029269","actor":{"login":"uSpike","id":5686650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODY2NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5686650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike","html_url":"https://github.com/uSpike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-14T23:57:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1342029271,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzNDIwMjkyNzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1342029271","actor":{"login":"uSpike","id":5686650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODY2NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5686650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike","html_url":"https://github.com/uSpike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uSpike/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-14T23:57:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1342029436,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEzNDIwMjk0MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/1342029436","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-14T23:57:50Z","label":{"name":"status:
