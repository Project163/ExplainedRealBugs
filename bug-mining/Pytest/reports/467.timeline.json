Specification of Issue\r\n## The definition of \"option existence\"\r\nBefore talking about the issue it is important to well define the term of an option existing vs not existing, as the docs distinguish between the two when defining its expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nAs we have observed, an option \"exists\" if the parser has been taught to expect it using `parser.addoption` (in `pytest_addoption` hook).\r\nOtherwise, the option is considered as a \"non-existent\".\r\n\r\n## Docs vs Observed Behaviour\r\nBelow, we present our observation of `getoption` behaviour under all possible circumstances, partitioned by the option's existence. Each table's cell represents `getoption` behaviour under a certain combination of `getoption`'s parameters `skip`, `default`, and option-existence of the given `name` parameter.\r\n\r\nIf we have observed a mismatch between the expected behaviour as documented (to the best of our ability) and how the code actually behaves, we have added such mention (in bold at the relevant cell) by mentioning \"doc:\" to signal that this is how we understand the documented behaviour, and \"code:\" to signal that this is the behaviour observed by running the method.\r\n\r\n`skip` means that `pytest.skip` is invoked.\r\n`ValueError` means it was raised.\r\n`{}` means that the default value was returned.\r\n`value` means that the option's value as specified by the user was returned.\r\n`None` means that `None` was returned.\r\n\r\n## option doesn't exist\r\n| `getoption`        | `skip=True`    |  `skip=False`   |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\r\n| `default={}` | **doc: Ambiguous if should `skip` or `{}`<br />code: `{}`** | `{}` |\r\n| `default=<NOTSET>` | `skip` | `ValueError` |\r\n\r\n## option exists and is None (value not provided in command line)\r\n| `getoption`        | `skip=True`    |  `skip=False`   |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\r\n| `default={}` | **doc: `skip`<br />code: `{}`** | `None` |\r\n| `default=<NOTSET>` | `skip` | `None` |\r\n\r\n## option exists and is not None (value provided by in command line)\r\n|  `getoption`       | `skip=True`    |  `skip=False`   |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\r\n| `default={}` | `value` | `value` |\r\n| `default=<NOTSET>` | `value` | `value` |\r\n\r\n## Oddity of the `default`  param of `getoption`\r\n\r\nAs we understand, the key problem is the ambiguity of how to handle both `default` and `skip` params being set.\r\n\r\nFrom our understanding, the `default` value is only relevant given that the option specified for `getoption` is non-existent. In this case, the \"added value\" of the `default` param is that it allows you to not care if it exists or not, just use the given `default` value. \r\n\r\nHowever, if an option is non-existent, then it is probably a programming error to ask for that option's value from `getoption` in the first place, hence it is probably better to skip \\ raise to let the user know that something is wrong.\r\n\r\nIn a case where a user wishes for a default value for his option, we believe it would be best to use `parser.addoption`'s `default` param, as it is a single-source of authority, whereas each caller of `getoption` might use it's own `default` causing chaos.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we believe that the `default` parameter of `getoption` is better off not existing in the first place. However, we are ignorant of the impact of breaking such interface. And perhaps there are legitimate usecases that we have not thought off, any insight is welcomed. \r\n\r\n## Possible Resolutions\r\n\r\nFor the first mismatch, we offer that the documentation will be amended to remove the ambiguity in the non-existent + skip + default being set usecase. In that case, we observed the default being returned, so it could be documented that the `default` it given priority over `skip`, or do not allow both being set.\r\n\r\nAs for the second mismatch, it is documented that the `default` is only relevant when the option doesn't exist. So in this case, we'd expect a `skip`.  We could amend the implementation to skip.\r\nAlso, we could amend the documentation instead, to explicitly let the user know `default` will be used even when the option does exist but is `None`, but only if `skip` is set.\r\nThis is very weird and we do not recommend this since the documentation gives the impression that the `default` parameter is only used when the option doesn't exist. It would also mean that we keep this confusing behaviour that when `skip=False` you get `None` and with `skip=True`  you get the `default`. \r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe ask that a maintainer will verify our understanding, and let us know how we should proceed with this, as some paths are ambiguous.

This function has been existed since forever, so it probably has grown organically.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts:\r\n\r\n* `skip` seems a really weird parameter; trying to get an undefined option should be a matter of explicitly getting an error. The fact that it treats `None` specially is also confusing (`None` can be a valid value for an option after all).\r\n* `default` also seems strange, as you mention, you should define `default` during `addoption` to have a single source of truth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we would do better to deprecate `getoption` altogether, and introduce a new variant (`get` or `get_option`) which more sane semantics. I propose:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get(self, name: str) -> Any:\r\n    \"\"\"\"\r\n    Gets the option named ``name`` (you can also use the user facing variant ``--name``), or raises \r\n    `OptionNotDefinedError`.\r\n    \"\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that the API is very straightforward for the user to use, and they can catch the `OptionNotDefinedError` and call `pytest.skip` if they really want pytest to stop if an option is not defined (which should be really rare).\r\n\r\nLet's see what others think.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1482893573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8839415105,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAjwLdc5X1xQizwAAAAIO3sVB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/8839415105","actor":{"login":"sus-pe","id":96086668,"node_id":"U_kgDOBboqjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96086668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe","html_url":"https://github.com/sus-pe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-24T14:27:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8839415138,"node_id":"SE_lADOAjwLdc5X1xQizwAAAAIO3sVi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/8839415138","actor":{"login":"sus-pe","id":96086668,"node_id":"U_kgDOBboqjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96086668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe","html_url":"https://github.com/sus-pe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-24T14:27:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1484165625","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10558#issuecomment-1484165625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10558","id":1484165625,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc5YdpH5","user":{"login":"sus-pe","id":96086668,"node_id":"U_kgDOBboqjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96086668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe","html_url":"https://github.com/sus-pe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-26T17:30:24Z","updated_at":"2023-03-26T17:30:24Z","body":"I

Either choose option (1) or (3) and let everything else be consistent with the chosen approach. \r\n\r\nSomething that I notice is that both (1) and (3) are dynamic bindings, as `config.option.foobar` would only be generated at runtime, and `config.get(\"foobar\")` is also dynamic in nature as I am passing a string to represent a config option. Could we find a static solution? Perhaps a way for the developer to define options in typed way, something like \r\n```py\r\nclass MySpecialOptions(PytestOption):\r\n      FOOBAR = ...\r\n      KISHKEBAB = ...\r\n\r\ndef test_foobar(config):\r\n     config.get(MySpecialOptions.FOOBAR)\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe `config.get` would be defined to accept any `PytestOption`\r\n```py\r\ndef get(self, name: PytestOption) -> Any:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/1501827756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sus-pe","id":96086668,"node_id":"U_kgDOBboqjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96086668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe","html_url":"https://github.com/sus-pe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sus-pe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8963894276,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAjwLdc5X1xQizwAAAAIWSiwE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/8963894276","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-10T13:43:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
