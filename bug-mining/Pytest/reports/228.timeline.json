pytest 4.5.0 (May 2019), we introduced `--strict-markers` as a replacement for `--strict`, and [said](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/changelog.html#pytest-4-5-0-2019-05-11):\r\n\r\n> The existing `--strict` option has the same behavior currently, but can be augmented in the future for additional checks.\r\n\r\nWith #7286, now we also have `--strict-config`. Yet, `--strict` is still an alias for `--strict-markers`. \r\n\r\nGiven that pytest 6 is allowed to do breaking changes, wouldn't it make sense for `--strict` to imply both `--strict-markers` and `--strict-config` now?\r\n\r\n(Though, on a second thought: Do we actually need `--strict-markers` in pytest 6 still, given the warning system? Probably still useful as a convenient way to turn those warnings into errors?)\r\n\r\nThis would also make pytest more in line with other tools with a `--strict` flag - mypy and tsc (the typescript compiler) come to mind, where `--strict` implies various different strict flags.\r\n\r\ncc @gnikonorov (who added `--strict-config`), @webknjaz and @DahlitzFlorian (some existing discussion in #7233),
