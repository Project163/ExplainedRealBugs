Thank you for your contribution! -->\r\n<!-- Unless your change is trivial, please create an issue to discuss the change before creating a PR -->\r\n<!-- We're currently in the process of rewriting pydantic in preparation for V2, see https://docs.pydantic.dev/blog/pydantic-v2/. -->\r\n<!-- **Note:** if you're making a pull request to fix pydantic v1.10, please make it against the `1.10.X-fixes` branch. -->\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short summary of the changes. -->\r\nI decided to try to run the pydantic test suite against current Python 3.12 to look for issues in typing. I had to ignore these warnings (already tracked in pytest-dev/pytest#10977) first to get the tests to run at all.\r\n\r\nNow a lot of tests fail for me locally with errors like\r\n\r\n```\r\nE               pytest.PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning: Exception ignored in: None\r\nE               \r\nE               Traceback (most recent call last):\r\nE                 File \"/Users/jelle/py/pydantic/pydantic/_internal/_core_utils.py\", line 247, in walk\r\nE                   return f(schema.copy(), self._walk)\r\nE                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nE               ResourceWarning: Object of type pydantic_core._pydantic_core.SchemaValidator is not untracked before destruction\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat might be a bug in `pydantic_core` but I haven't investigated further. Still, this PR at least enables running the test suite.\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\n<!-- Are there any issues opened that will be resolved by merging this change? -->\r\n<!-- WARNING: please use \"fix #123\" style references so the issue is closed when this PR is merged. -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [ ] Unit tests for the changes exist\r\n* [ ] Tests pass on CI and coverage remains at

Changes\r\n- Enable new tarfile extraction protections in Python 3.12\r\n  - https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#other-language-changes\r\n  - This applies the new [\"data\" filter](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.data_filter) to unpacking tar files\r\n  - This prevents the unpacked files from using absolute filepaths or symlinks from referencing absolute filepaths or filepaths outside of the target directory\r\n  - Additionally, the permissions are sanitized to basically ensure they are sane; e.g. world execute permissions are removed if the owner doesn't have execute permissions.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- `DeprecationWarning` from pytest for `ast` constants\r\n  - https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10977\r\n- `DeprecationWarning` from dateutil for `datetime.utcfromtimestamp()` usage\r\n  - https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/issues/1284\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all

Did you mean: 'zipimporter'?\r\n  ```\r\n  * There was additional upstream breakage that has now been fixed [in `aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/7229) (fixed on develop, should be included in 3.9) and [in `frozenlist`](https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/433) (released in [1.4.0](https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/releases/tag/v1.4.0))\r\n* [x] Update CI to run with 3.12 (done in #2516)\r\n  * Looks like the `python-versions` Action is [capable of providing the 3.12.0b1 pre-release](https://github.com/actions/python-versions/blob/7693cef3461cf6902845be55593a2328fef3bea3/versions-manifest.json#L3), so we could run against the beta version(s) before the official release ([scheduled](https://peps.python.org/pep-0693/) for 2 October 2023).\r\n* [x] Update classifiers list in `pyproject.toml` (done in #2516)\r\n* ~~[ ] Check on 3.12 support concerns for official non-core plugins~~ Not core's problem —

ast.Constant instead\r\n  ret[-1] = ast.Str(ret[-1].s + p.s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/blob/76b049dd45fd072fb62a54bccc0e8d513b03f4d8/src/werkzeug/routing/rules.py#L757\r\n\r\nThe documentation states \"Changed in version 3.8: Class [ast.Constant](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.Constant) is now used for all constants.\" so I don't know if the `ast.Str` conditions are even working in versions 3.8+.\r\n\r\nConsidering Werkzeug just dropped support for Python 3.7, the rules code could be refactored to use the new type without breaking compatibility\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n- Python version: 3.12a1\r\n- Werkzeug version: 2.2.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/werkzeug/issues/2704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/werkzeug/issues/2704/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9396246155,"node_id":"SE_lADOAjwLdc5leEsTzwAAAAIwD1aL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/9396246155","actor":{"login":"aj-white","id":72359843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMzU5ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72359843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white","html_url":"https://github.com/aj-white","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aj-white/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-31T22:49:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"s-hertel","id":19572925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTcyOTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19572925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel","html_url":"https://github.com/s-hertel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-hertel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-05T13:38:58Z","updated_at":"2023-06-05T13:38:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/issues/80968","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/issues/80968/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/issues/80968/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/issues/80968/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/80968","id":1741776051,"node_id":"PR_kwDOADeGtM5SMdbK","number":80968,"title":"replace

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWe're using yarl in https://github.com/python/blurb_it and are testing against `3.12-dev` on GitHub Actions to help find problems early so they can be fixed before the full release.\r\n\r\nWith Python 3.12.0a4, yarl-1.8.2.tar.gz installed fine.\r\n\r\nWith the newest Python 3.12.0a5, yarl-1.8.2.tar.gz fails to install (on Ubuntu). For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarl/_quoting_c.c:10674:53: error: ‘PyLongObject’ {aka ‘struct _longobject’} has no member named ‘ob_digit’\r\n10674 |             const digit* digits = ((PyLongObject*)x)->ob_digit;\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like this is the cause: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/101292 / https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101291\r\n\r\nHere's a similar report for Cython: https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5238\r\n\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. With Ubuntu 22.04 (or macOS Ventura 13.2.1) and Python 3.12.0a5\r\n2. `python3.12 -m pip install yarl`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nyarl installs.\r\n\r\n###
