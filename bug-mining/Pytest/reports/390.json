Node class hierarchy has some classes which are only meant to be used as base classes, never instantiated directly. These are `Node`, `Collector`, `Item`, `File`, `FSCollector`, `PyCollector`.\r\n\r\nI propose we mark them as abstract i.e. inherit from `abc.ABC`. Reasons:\r\n\r\n- Trying to instantiate fails quickly at runtime\r\n- Type checkers issue an error if trying to instantiate\r\n- The docs will show `abstractmethod` on the abstract methods that need to be implemented (`collect` or `runtest`), and show inheritance from `ABC` making it clear it's a base class\r\n\r\nIt seems somewhat hard to deprecate, and it will only cause errors when the code is already very wrong. So I propose to do it in pytest 8.0 without deprecation.","closed_by":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11676/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
