to know Hypothesis is also on Tidelift! 😁)\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing this. I've had a brief conversation with @jaraco in https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.tidelift/issues/1, which has started `jaraco.tidelift` for this purpose. \r\n\r\nI believe the hardest part of a general \"upload release notes\" process is *getting* the release notes, as projects use wildly different approaches to that.\r\n\r\nAnyway the work you already done is definitely great already, and can be used as basis for a more general project, or something that works with `towncrier`. 👍 \r\n\r\nThis thread also gives me the idea of writing a generic \"changelog uploader to Tidelift and GH release notes\", based on towncrier (at least initially).\r\n\r\nAhh so many interesting projects to tackle, so little time. 😁
