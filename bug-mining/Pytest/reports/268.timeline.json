entirely sure. This will delay things a bit further I assume, but it would be a cleaner way forward, and also fit in nicely with e.g. `tmpdir` -> `tmp_path` as you say.\r\n\r\nHowever, so far I'm still not convinced if we can come up with sensible new names really. Not sure about `file_sys_path` mostly, I don't understand `sys` in that context. `file_sys` as in filesystem? Seems to confusing due to the `sys` module and `sys.path` IMHO.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can keep `path` for the `Node` argument and attribute though, and only find something new for hooks, like proposed by @bluetech earlier?\r\n\r\nBy all means, if the consensus is \"let's stop bikeshedding this and go with #9341\", that's fine by me too.
