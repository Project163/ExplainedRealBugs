The idea is that we current display 6 different texts on a single line without any visual help to make it easier to read\r\n```\r\n<MARKER> <file-path>::<test_function[parameter]><optional message/error>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\n\r\nAttention should be taken to not over-do-it, too much coloring would also make reading harder.\r\n\r\nPS.
