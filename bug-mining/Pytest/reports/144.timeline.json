`comtypes`ers,\r\n\r\nAs `comtypes` is currently experiencing a new lease of life (thanks particularly to the efforts of @junkmd), I wanted to gauge the level of interest from contributors in adding in new tooling to support the development process. There is now such a rich ecosystem of packaging tools including things like `tox`/`nox` for isolating and automating test builds, formatters like `black` (that can be run with `pre-commit`), linters like `pylint` or `ruff`, `setuptools_scm` for version management, and `towncrier` for generating the changelog.\r\n\r\nWhile I am not suggesting the immediate or wholesale adoption of all these options, I think that incorporating some of these tools could make the development process easier for new contributors to get started with, and probably simplify things for everybody. However, I realise that this would also require a certain amount of work, and also some discussion to try and achieve consensus on what tools to use, and that may not appeal to everyone involved. So I decided to open this issue to see whether I get enthusiastic support, naked hostility, or studied indifference. Let me know what you all think...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enthought/comtypes/issues/480/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enthought/comtypes/issues/480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
