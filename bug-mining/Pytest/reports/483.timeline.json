(2024-04-27)</h1>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#12069](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069): A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated <code>py.path.local</code> parameter instead of the <code>pathlib.Path</code> parameter which replaced it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pytest_ignore_collect</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>collection_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_collect_file</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>file_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_pycollect_makemodule</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>module_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_header</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_collectionfinish</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.\nThe old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.</p>\n<p>See <code>legacy-path-hooks-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#11871](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871): Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character <code>@</code>, like e.g.: <code>pytest @tests.txt</code>. The file must have one argument per line.</p>\n<p>See <code>Read arguments from file &lt;args-from-file&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#11523](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11523): <code>pytest.importorskip</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} will now issue a warning if the module could be found, but raised <code>ImportError</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} instead of <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}.</p>\n<p>The warning can be suppressed by passing <code>exc_type=ImportError</code> to <code>pytest.importorskip</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}.</p>\n<p>See <code>import-or-skip-import-error</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[#11728](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11728): For <code>unittest</code>-based tests, exceptions during class cleanup (as raised by functions registered with <code>TestCase.addClassCleanup &lt;unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;meth&quot;}) are now reported instead of silently failing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[#11777](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11777): Text is no longer truncated in the <code>short test summary info</code> section when <code>-vv</code> is given.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[#12112](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12112): Improved namespace packages detection when <code>consider_namespace_packages</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;confval&quot;} is enabled, covering more situations (like editable installs).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[#9502](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9502): Added <code>PYTEST_VERSION</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;envvar&quot;} environment variable which is defined at the start of the pytest session and undefined afterwards. It contains the value of <code>pytest.**version**</code>, and among other things can be used to easily check if code is running from within a pytest run.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[#12065](https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12065): Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where test classes containing <code>setup_method</code> and tests using <code>@staticmethod</code> or <code>@classmethod</code> would crash with <code>AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'setup_method'</code>.</p>\n<p>Now the <code>request.instance &lt;pytest.FixtureRequest.instance&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;attr&quot;} attribute of tests using <code>@staticmethod</code> and <code>@classmethod</code> is no longer <code>None</code>, but a fresh instance of the class, like in non-static methods.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

a detailed description of the bug or problem you are having\r\n\r\n(I've done my best to try and see if this is a duplicate and I'm sorry if it is, but it seems it's not)\r\n\r\nFollowing #11777 (8.2.0) | changelog:\r\n> Text is no longer truncated in the short test summary info section when -vv is given.\r\n\r\nThe short summary can become completely impractical with `-vv` because each failure message could be hundreds of lines long.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a strange choice given #11777 is about the text being truncated in:\r\n```\r\nE       assert 50 == 49\r\nE        +  where 50 = len({0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, ...})\r\n```\r\nand I don't see the original poster complaining about the short summary, but both were changed?\r\n\r\nWas it the intended change ? Is there something we can do to keep the original -vv behaviour for the test output, and keep the \"short test summary\" short ? It's actually quite useful in CI that the last thing printed is the list of tests that failed and not why each of them failed: it's a summary and the full output is available above anyway.\r\n\r\nI think the decision a lot of versions ago to add an excerpt of the failure reason to the short summary was a good compromise: it used otherwise unused space to add more useful info. But if that excerpt start taking more screen real estate space (potentially 100x more) than the summary itself, I'm not sure I understand why we would want that?\r\n\r\nMaybe we could introduce a different \"letter\" (or a different option or something) to `-r` to get the list of tests without any kind of explanation of why they failed? Maybe the fix for #11777 should have affected the \"failure explanation\" and not the short summary?\r\n\r\n### output of `pip list` from the virtual environment you are using\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$

for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCloses #12713. \r\n\r\nThe fix for issue #11777 removed any output shortening in the test summary output when `-vv` is used, leading to potentially long/redundant summary messages. The issue in #11777 is also now fully fixed, as series were still condensed in output even with full verbosity.\r\n\r\nSince the removal of the summary shortening has been in place for a while, the addition of a new runtime option seemed to be the best way to address #12713 without changes to existing functionality. `--force-short-summary` was added to always show a shortened summary message regardless of the verbosity setting. Additionally, when using `-vv`, `saferepr_unlimited` is now called to fully resolve #11777.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13061/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16069875468,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc57QPgZzwAAAAO91tcM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/16069875468","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d471aef98473523f400f092071dadc7f745c7196","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kenny-y-dev/pytest/commits/d471aef98473523f400f092071dadc7f745c7196","created_at":"2025-01-26T12:30:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16069949122,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc57QPgZzwAAAAO91_bC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/16069949122","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"576ed15e839823ccfbec0733127596543ca4562e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicoddemus/pytest/commits/576ed15e839823ccfbec0733127596543ca4562e","created_at":"2025-01-26T12:58:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-26T12:59:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-26T12:59:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13163","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13163/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13163/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13163/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/13163","id":2811546195,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAjwLdc6JAgae","number":13163,"title":"[8.3.x]
