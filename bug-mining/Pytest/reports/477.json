Sometimes this list is empty, which disables some tests as a result. However, I would expect the `ids` callback that I provide to not be called at all in that case, but it is actually called with the private `NOTSET` sentinel. As this is not exported, I can't easily check for it in my `ids` function and return a useless value to match it.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction:\r\n\r\n`conftest.py`\r\n```python\r\nimport logging\r\n\r\ndef idmap(obj):\r\n    logging.info(obj)\r\n\r\ndef pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):\r\n    if \"arg\" in metafunc.fixturenames:\r\n        metafunc.parametrize(\r\n            \"arg\", [], ids=idmap\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\n`test_demo.py`\r\n```python\r\ndef test_demo(arg):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$: pytest --collect-only --log-cli-level=DEBUG\r\n...\r\nINFO     root:conftest.py:4 NotSetType.token\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython: 3.10.15\r\npytest: 8.3.4\r\nOS: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1","closed_by":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13031/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
