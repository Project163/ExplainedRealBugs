You cannot hop between exceptions in the chain\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nPython 3.13.0a1 added support for jumping between chained exception in Pdb (https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/f75cefd402c4c830228d85ca3442377ebaf09454). `pdb.post_mortem` and `pdb.Pdb.interaction` must be passed an exception object for this to work. These functions used to accept only a traceback, so that's what pytest is passing currently. If pytest passes an exception instead then exception chains can be navigated.
