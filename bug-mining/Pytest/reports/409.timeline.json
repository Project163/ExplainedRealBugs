for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [X] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [X] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [X] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in alphabetical order.\r\n-->\r\nAllow for the output of test case execution to be controlled independently from the application verbosity level. `verbosity_test_case` is the new ini setting to adjust this functionality.\r\n\r\nAddresses

This allows me to see at a glance if any tests have failed, and if so, in which group there is a problem. In verbose mode, this is not the case, since the tests scroll too fast on the screen, and there is no global view. Yet, the `-vv` option is essential to see other useful information and avoid output to be truncated in case of failure.\r\n\r\nHence my question: do you think it would make sense to add an option to force the display using dots regardless of the level of verbosity?\r\n\r\nI can definitively implement this and open a PR if you find it interesting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6292/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
