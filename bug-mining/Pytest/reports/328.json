I was very confused to see that pytest wasn't raising any errors. After some digging, I found that the `message` and `module` components of the warnings filter are [interpreted differently](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#the-warnings-filter) for the python argument `-W` (outside of the pytest context), and that \r\n\r\n>  message is a literal string that the start of the warning message must contain (case-insensitively), ignoring any whitespace at the start or end of message\r\n\r\nI tried `\"-W error:Only:UserWarning\"` and that finally matched the warning. I have two complaints:\r\n\r\n- pytest documentation should warn that when using `-W` instead of `filterwarnings`, the `message` and `module` params are interpreted differently\r\n- Is there any reason that pytest `-W` has to follow the convention of the [generic python command-line option](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-W) `-W`? Message pattern matching for `-W` is not as powerful. In this example, I only care about the `client_row_transfer_limit` part which appears at the beginning of  my message.\r\n\r\n- [x] a detailed description of the bug or problem you are having\r\n- [ ] output of `pip list` from the virtual environment you are using\r\n- [x] pytest and operating system versions\r\n- [ ] minimal example if possible\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10687/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
