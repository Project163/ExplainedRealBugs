know that is is changed recently and as I said, I agree using exact comparisons for Boolean is reasonable (I think its borderline unacceptable to do so in a patch release or even a minor release but that’s a different issue).\n\nHowever, type exact comparisons is way more strict than exact equality which I believe was what the original issue was asking about. This introduce a significant inconsistency between Boolean type and other types that’s way more significant their corresponding value range would suggest. It’s unclear where this should end. Should integer get the same treatment? After all, they also take discrete values and not continuous ones.\n\nThe argument that raising more error is good also doesn’t make any sense. If raising more error / returning false is seen as a benefit, then why not make everything that’s not floating point fail when using approx. After all, someone calling approx on integer or boolean may be doing so unintentionally so the safe thing to do here should be simply erroring out for all cases there any non floating point values and just require the user to do something about it instead. Also note that the “do something” could involve replicating approx’s logic with nested data structures e.g. for comparing [True] and [1].\n\nAnd fwiw, the fix https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/13132 for the linked issue shows how wrong the exact type comparison is. Unless there’s a standard way to query if a type should be treated as bool, adding special cases for third party types simply doesn’t make sense. I’m sure there are other libraries that implement such types (numba seems to have it previously). Are those types going to be added as special cases as well? If not, I don’t see why numpy should be singled out if it was not a direct dependency.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2709055344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yuyichao","id":712232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjIzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/712232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao","html_url":"https://github.com/yuyichao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuyichao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16755654342,"node_id":"SE_lADOAjwLdc6pstylzwAAAAPmtv7G","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/16755654342","actor":{"login":"VictorWTang","id":33789988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzg5OTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33789988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorWTang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorWTang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-14T04:26:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2731121338","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13218#issuecomment-2731121338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13218","id":2731121338,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjwLdc6iyZq6","user":{"login":"TTsangSC","id":147423890,"node_id":"U_kgDOCMmCkg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147423890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC","html_url":"https://github.com/TTsangSC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TTsangSC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-17T22:46:09Z","updated_at":"2025-03-17T22:46:09Z","body":"Hi, sorry for barging in, but here's my two cents as a fellow user.\n\n- Another somewhat counterintuitive edge case is how\n  ```python\n  >>> 1 == pytest.approx(True)\n  False\n  >>> True == pytest.approx(1)\n  True\n  ```\n  Approximate equality being in a sense not commutative sounds a bit wrong to me.\n- On the topic of booleans, I've done this in a personal project:\n  ```python\n  def is_bool(x) -> bool:\n      \"\"\"Test boolean-like-ness via `str()` round-tripping.\"\"\"\n      as_str = str(x)\n      values = {'True': True, 'False': False}\n      try:\n          return bool(x == values[as_str])\n      except Exception:\n          return False\n  ```\n  which does catch both `builtins.bool` and `numpy.bool_` in a *kinda* logically consistent and dependency-agnostic way. (Of course it falls apart if someone implemented their booleans like `def __str__(self) -> str: return 'T' if self else 'F'`, but still.)\n- While I do agree *on principle* that it doesn't make sense for `numpy` booleans to receive special treatment as a non-direct dep, FWIW the ship has sailed and much of `pytest.approx` is already engineered specifically with `numpy` compatibility in mind (e.g. `_pytest.python_api.ApproxNumpy`). So *maybe* special-casing `numpy.bool_` isn't as bad (nor as much of) a precedent as it sounds, but a more general implementation (that is also more robust than what I have above) would be much welcome.

was looking at this for a first issue and went to just change the docs but after reading them it seems already evident, although somewhat tucked away, that the approach that has been taken here --as

With that being said, I really don't see how that can be reconciled with @TTsangSC's edge case of\n```\n>>> True == pytest.approx(1)\nTrue\n```\nor likewise\n```\n>>> False == pytest.approx(0)\nTrue\n```\nIt seems to me that this is actually a bug and warrants new tests.

I've found out that tests have in fact already been added already in the previously mentioned pull request under the `test_expecting_bool` function, except that they've all been `# noqa : E712` tagged.  I think raising a separate issue for that matter is probably a good idea, which can improve on the changes in that aforementioned pr by just fixing the `__eq__` method for `ApproxScalar` to account for its asymmetry.\n\nAs for the issue initially raised here, @natmokval I think it's still just a matter of changing the docs.

checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits. Please uncheck this if you prefer to squash the commits yourself.\r\n\r\nIf this change fixes an issue, please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add text like ``closes #XYZW`` to the PR description and/or commits (where ``XYZW`` is the issue number). See the [github docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.\r\n\r\nUnless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a new changelog file in the `changelog` folder, with a name like `<ISSUE NUMBER>.<TYPE>.rst`. See [changelog/README.rst](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/changelog/README.rst) for details.\r\n\r\n  Write sentences in the **past or present tense**, examples:\r\n\r\n  * *Improved verbose diff output with sequences.*\r\n  * *Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.*\r\n\r\n  Also make sure to end the sentence with a `.`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS` in
