commit is a cleanup commit (no functional changes intended).\r\n\r\nThe second commit fixes #12355.\r\n\r\nIn the issue, it was reported that the `reorder_items` has quadratic (or worse...) behavior with certain simple parametrizations. After some debugging I found that the problem happens because the \"Fix items_by_argkey order\" loop keeps adding the same item to the deque, and it reaches epic sizes which causes the slowdown.\r\n\r\nI don't claim to understand how the `reorder_items` algorithm works, but if as far as I understand, if an item already exists in the deque, the correct thing to do is to move it to the front. Since a deque doesn't have such an (efficient) operation, this switches to `OrderedDict` which can efficiently append from both sides, deduplicate and move to front.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13031282106,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc6JvS_7zwAAAAMIuZW6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/13031282106","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e89d23b24741c001e8651a77303992cfa41c1664","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bluetech/pytest/commits/e89d23b24741c001e8651a77303992cfa41c1664","created_at":"2024-06-04T07:15:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13031286886,"node_id":"CE_lADOAjwLdc6JvS_7zwAAAAMIuahm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/13031286886","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-04T07:16:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13031560997,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc6JvS_7zwAAAAMIvdcl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/13031560997","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"153a436bc40c9e89d90d62255ef5a89e9a762dca","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bluetech/pytest/commits/153a436bc40c9e89d90d62255ef5a89e9a762dca","created_at":"2024-06-04T07:35:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"luke-chapman","id":59296898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Mjk2ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59296898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-chapman","html_url":"https://github.com/luke-chapman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-chapman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-chapman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-chapman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-chapman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-chapman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-chapman/orgs","repos_url":"https://ap
