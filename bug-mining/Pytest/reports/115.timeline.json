\n\n```\n#!python\n\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.yield_fixture(scope=\"session\", autouse=True)\ndef print_session():\n    print \"session fixture\"\n    yield\n    print \"session teardown\"\n\n\nclass

      print \"test method\"\n```\n\n`pytest --capture=no test_file.py` will generate the following output:\n\n```\n#!bash\n\n==================== test session starts ====================\nplatform darwin -- Python 2.7.5 -- py-1.4.20 -- pytest-2.5.2\ncollected 1 items\n\ntests/test_ordering.py method setup\nsession fixture\ntest method\n.method teardown\nsession teardown\n\n\n================= 1 passed in 0.01 seconds =================\n```\n\nit looks like all `setup_*` methods are invoked before any fixtures are processed, but the `teardown_*` methods are called in the order you'd expect:\n- method_fixture post-yield\n- method_teardown\n- class_fixture post-yield\n- class_teardown\n- module_fixture post-yield\n- module_teardown\n\netc, etc.\n\nthat doesn't seem right, especially since the teardowns are in the correct order. In fact it's pretty bad, because you might (I would think rightly) depend on the session having been set up already in your `setup_method`.\n\n---\n- Bitbucket:

for #3094.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'm not able to get this to work with yield tests, their expectations about when `setup_*` functions are called break when we move the `setup_*` call to fixtures.\r\n\r\nConsider this test (simplified from `test_runner_xunit.py::test_func_generator_setup`):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\ndef setup_module(mod):\r\n    mod.x = []\r\n\r\ndef test_one():\r\n    assert x == []\r\n    def check():\r\n        assert True\r\n    yield check\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what happens on `master`: during collection, `setup_module` is called (by `Node.setup()`), then `test_one` is called to generate the internal yield test function `check`. For this reason, the `assert x == []` line at the beginning of `test_one` works.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does is to inject an autouse module-scoped fixture which calls `setup_module`. The problem is that this changes the semantics of yield-tests: `test_one` is still called during collection to generate the `check` test, but `setup_module` has not been called yet because it will be called by a fixture later during the runtest phase, so the line `assert x == []` fails.\r\n\r\nI don't see a way around this, so I'm afraid we will have to post-pone this for pytest 4.1, when we finally remove yield-tests.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4091/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/428003246","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3094#issuecomment-428003246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3094","id":428003246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODAwMzI0Ng==","user":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T22:46:55Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T22:46:55Z","body":"As
