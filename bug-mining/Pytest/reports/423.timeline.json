But with `--tb=native` can see the same thing for Exception as well.\r\n\r\nSo what happens is, when the session fixture is first requested by the first test, it is executed, raises, and the exception is cached as the result of the fixture. When the next test requests the fixture, we see the cached exception and re-raise it.\r\n\r\nBut in python, exception objects are mutable; whenever you `raise` an exception, it appends entries to the traceback. So on every `raise` of the cached exception, the traceback gets longer and longer...\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Example</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport traceback\r\n\r\ndef bad():\r\n    1 / 0\r\n\r\ncache = None\r\ndef foo():\r\n    global cache\r\n    if cache is not None:\r\n        raise cache\r\n    try:\r\n        bad()\r\n    except Exception as exc:\r\n        cache = exc\r\n        raise\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    foo()\r\nexcept Exception:\r\n    traceback.print_exc()\r\n\r\nprint('\\n')\r\ntry:\r\n    foo()\r\nexcept Exception:\r\n    traceback.print_exc()\r\n\r\nprint('\\n')\r\ntry:\r\n    foo()\r\nexcept Exception:\r\n    traceback.print_exc()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 18, in <module>\r\n    foo()\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 12, in foo\r\n    bad()\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 4, in bad\r\n    1 / 0\r\n    ~~^~~\r\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\r\n\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 24, in <module>\r\n    foo()\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 10, in foo\r\n    raise cache\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 18, in <module>\r\n    foo()\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 12, in foo\r\n    bad()\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 4, in bad\r\n    1 / 0\r\n    ~~^~~\r\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\r\n\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 30, in <module>\r\n    foo()\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 10, in foo\r\n    raise cache\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 24, in <module>\r\n    foo()\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 10, in foo\r\n    raise cache\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 18, in <module>\r\n    foo()\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 12, in foo\r\n    bad()\r\n  File \"/home/ran/src/pytest/yy.py\", line 4, in bad\r\n    1 / 0\r\n    ~~^~~\r\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is to keep the original traceback, and re-raise with it.\r\n\r\nTurns out, this is how it was done in pytest < 8.0, before I mindlessly broke it in #11208 / 9d0ddb462517fc6c4f6dc7e0f1e14af2e08aeed9. So I need to revert this.\r\n\r\nBTW, there is another place where we do this raising of cached exception thing, in `SetupState.setup()`. This one I also broke, but a few years earlier, in 978b315861c553618fd7ec813e21f3e3916f0d09. I will fix this as well.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/2081239376/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12634433014,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc6FO81dzwAAAALxEiX2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/12634433014","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0b91d5e3e869d00c01c614d827745a9ed4cddb43","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bluetech/pytest/commits/0b91d5e3e869d00c01c614d827745a9ed4cddb43","created_at":"2024-04-28T10:30:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12634433016,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjwLdc6FO81dzwAAAALxEiX4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/12634433016","actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3e81cb2f455fa091bc5a78742d190437f8281c68","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bluetech/pytest/commits/3e81cb2f455fa091bc5a78742d190437f8281c68","created_at":"2024-04-28T10:30:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-28T10:32:18Z","updated_at":"2024-04-28T10:32:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-de
