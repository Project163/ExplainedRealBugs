an upgrade to Pytest 8, we are seeing a change in the way duplicate items are handled, which does not seem logical/expected to me.\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\n\r\nLet's assume we have the following directory structure:\r\n\r\n```plain\r\n> tree tests\r\ntests\r\n├── subdirectory\r\n│   └── test_two.py\r\n└── test_one.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith Pytest 7, if we call `pytest test_one.py tests --collect-only`, it returns 3\r\ntests:\r\n\r\n```plain\r\n============================= test session starts ==============================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.12.2, pytest-7.0.0, pluggy-1.4.0\r\nrootdir: /home\r\ncollected 3 items\r\n\r\n<Module tests/test_one.py>\r\n  <Function test_one>\r\n<Module tests/test_one.py>\r\n  <Function test_one>\r\n<Module tests/subdirectory/test_two.py>\r\n  <Function test_two>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith Pytest 8, we get only one:\r\n\r\n```plain\r\n============================= test session starts ==============================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.12.2, pytest-8.0.2, pluggy-1.4.0\r\nrootdir: /home\r\ncollected 1 item\r\n\r\n<Dir home>\r\n  <Dir tests>\r\n    <Module test_one.py>\r\n      <Function test_one>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter looking a bit at Pytest's internals, the change looks related to the refactoring done in #11646, where the duplicates handling logic was moved away from the former `_collectfile` method (which, I guess, operate on a file-per-file basis), to be consolidated in `genitems()` (in which a single duplicate in a *node* will result in the complete node being ignored).\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect `test_one.py` not to prevent the further collection of tests in `subdirectory`, even though it's a duplicate.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm also a bit puzzled by the previous behavior in Pytest 7, as I wouldn't have expected to see `tests/test_one.py` twice (as I didn't pass the `--keep-duplicates` option).\r\n\r\nAre my expectations correct in the first place, or did I misunderstand the changes to the test collection and the behavior is expected?\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\n- With a bit of guidance, I would be willing to provide a patch (if it's a real bug of course 🙂)\r\n- Reproduced on Pytest 8.0.2 / Linux & macOS\r\n- **I made [a repository](https://github.com/nonatomiclabs/2024-03-06-pytest-8-duplicate-tests-issue?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-reproduce) that contains a Dockerfile to reproduce the issue easily, please let me know
