@alfredodeza,\r\n\r\nFair question.\r\n\r\n`setup` and `teardown` work because of the nose-style support.\r\n\r\nFor example, the example below works when executing `pytest`, but fails with `pytest -p no:nose`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Test:\r\n\r\n    def setup(self):\r\n        self.x = 1\r\n\r\n    def test_foo(self):\r\n        assert self.x == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this is a nose-idiom, not a pytest-idiom.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we need to document `setup()` and `teardown()` more explicitly in the [nose page](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/nose.html)? 🤔

point @nicoddemus .
