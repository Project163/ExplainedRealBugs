pytest _always_ truncates any output string when displaying assertion errors to 240 characters (it is hardcoded in `saferepr`). This is often a problem, specially in CI (#6682).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/8391 changes how verbosity affects truncation of assertion output, like this:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>Verbosity\r\n\t<td>Max chars\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>0\r\n\t<td>240\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>1\r\n\t<td>240\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>2\r\n\t<td>240\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>3\r\n\t<td>2400\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>4+\r\n\t<td>No limit\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nThe intent here was to keep the normal `-v` and `-vv` (the more common verbosity levels) unchanged, however I have been thinking that perhaps it makes more sense to increase the threshold starting right with `-v`, like this:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>Verbosity\r\n\t<td>Max chars\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>0\r\n\t<td>240\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>1\r\n\t<td>2400\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>2+\r\n\t<td>No limit\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nThe logic is that one who is increasing verbosity already expects more output anyway, so it makes sense to increase the threshold limit as well.\r\n\r\ncc

think that we need to make these values configurable regardless of the verbosity level, especially as we know that changing general verbosity level has other side effects.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that most people would want to run in minimal verbosity level (especially) on ci but have verbose errors for failed tests.\r\n\r\nIf I run in verbose by default displaying the console log in the browser
