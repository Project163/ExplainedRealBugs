the [PRs by @evildmp](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aevildmp+is%3Aclosed) on this - I think it was mostly #8433, but probably others as well.\r\n\r\nHaving a list of how the documentation moved certainly would be a good starting point, then we could also add redirects to fix existing links (see #8471).\r\n\r\nHowever, I suppose it's not always that easy, as one page (in the old docs) typically got split into three (in the new docs). For example, should the old [fixture docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html) now redirect to:\r\n\r\n- [The fixtures how-to](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html)\r\n- [The fixtures explanation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/fixtures.html)\r\n- [The fixtures reference](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/fixtures.html)\r\n\r\nIt's tricky, and I wish we'd have given this more consideration when restructuring those docs...\r\n\r\nI'm also wondering if changing all those links is really the right approach, or we should go for a different solution. I'll post over in #8471 about that one. Let's try to get to a consensus there, and then maybe you can help with that, if that works for

I think there are two ways to go about that:\r\n\r\n1. HTTP redirects - requires server configuration. Looks like ReadTheDocs [can do it](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-defined-redirects.html).\r\n2. HTML redirects - requires placeholder pages with `<meta refresh>`. Can use a [sphinx plugin](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-reredirects/) to do it or implement one ourselves. \r\n\r\nI think server redirects are easier and more recommended.
