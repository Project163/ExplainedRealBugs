releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>8.2.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.2.0 (2024-04-27)</h1>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069\">#12069</a>: A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated <code>py.path.local</code> parameter instead of the <code>pathlib.Path</code> parameter which replaced it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pytest_ignore_collect</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>collection_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_collect_file</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>file_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_pycollect_makemodule</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>module_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_header</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_collectionfinish</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.\nThe old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.</p>\n<p>See <code>legacy-path-hooks-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871\">#11871</a>: Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character <code>@</code>, like e.g.: <code>pytest @tests.txt</code>. The file must have one argument per line.</p>\n<p>See <code>Read arguments from file &lt;args-from-file&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11523\">#11523</a>: <code>pytest.importorskip</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} will now issue a warning if the module could be found, but raised <code>ImportError</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} instead of <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}.</p>\n<p>The warning can be suppressed by passing <code>exc_type=ImportError</code> to <code>pytest.importorskip</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}.</p>\n<p>See <code>import-or-skip-import-error</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11728\">#11728</a>: For <code>unittest</code>-based tests, exceptions during class cleanup (as raised by functions registered with <code>TestCase.addClassCleanup &lt;unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;meth&quot;}) are now reported instead of silently failing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11777\">#11777</a>: Text is no longer truncated in the <code>short test summary info</code> section when <code>-vv</code> is given.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12112\">#12112</a>: Improved namespace packages detection when <code>consider_namespace_packages</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;confval&quot;} is enabled, covering more situations (like editable installs).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9502\">#9502</a>: Added <code>PYTEST_VERSION</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;envvar&quot;} environment variable which is defined at the start of the pytest session and undefined afterwards. It contains the value of <code>pytest.__version__</code>, and among other things can be used to easily check if code is running from within a pytest run.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12065\">#12065</a>: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where test classes containing <code>setup_method</code> and tests using <code>@staticmethod</code> or <code>@classmethod</code> would crash with <code>AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'setup_method'</code>.</p>\n<p>Now the <code>request.instance &lt;pytest.FixtureRequest.instance&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;attr&quot;} attribute of tests using <code>@staticmethod</code> and <code>@classmethod</code> is no longer <code>None</code>, but a fresh instance of the class, like in non-static methods.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

context\r\n\r\nDiscovered as a result of `nwg-panel`'s dependency on the package\r\n\r\n### Notify maintainers\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease @ people who are in the `meta.maintainers` list of the offending package or module.\r\nIf in doubt, check `git blame` for whoever last touched something.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n@moni-dz\r\n\r\n### Metadata\r\n\r\nPlease run `nix-shell -p nix-info --run \"nix-info -m\"` and paste the result.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n[user@system:~]$ nix-shell -p nix-info --run \"nix-info -m\"\r\n - system: `\"x86_64-linux\"`\r\n - host os: `Linux 6.6.33, NixOS, 24.11 (Vicuna), 24.11.20240709.feb2849`\r\n - multi-user?: `yes`\r\n - sandbox: `yes`\r\n - version: `nix-env (Nix) 2.18.4`\r\n - nixpkgs: `/nix/store/5w7nhyvrgsa81h0kyifmbl6j97hvlzh5-source`\r\n```\r\n\r\n^^ But this is misleading because the nixpkgs version I am trying to build from is not that version since this happened after I updated my flake.lock so the new version hasn't been pinned yet for me\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdd a :+1: [reaction] to [issues you find important].\r\n\r\n[reaction]: https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/\r\n[issues you find
