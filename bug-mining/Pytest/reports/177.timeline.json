for submitting an issue!\r\n\r\nHere's a quick checklist for what to provide:\r\n-->\r\nPrior to #5686 (I think) one could provide absolute paths to `tmpdir_factory`. I understand the security issues this brings. However, I had a `conftest.py` implementation which used `tmpdir_factory.getbasetemp()` and it self created full paths with the base being `getbasetemp()`.\r\n\r\nI think in such cases `pytest` should not fail since the directory is valid and could easily be checked against.\r\n\r\nI.e. the directory/file passed should be resolved and if it is prefixed with `getbasetemp` then all is good, else fails.\r\n\r\nI am only now encountering these problems in Travis, pytest version 5.4.1 (not on my local box, since I haven't updated pytest, I am still on 5.0.1).\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://travis-ci.org/github/zerothi/sisl/jobs/663854528?utm_medium=notification&utm_source=email) for the output which creates the fails.\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/zerothi/sisl/blob/987edeff2242792e7a4aa9d66a868fa621fb99d3/sisl/conftest.py#L34) for the implementation which itself collects the directories and files that are created.\r\n\r\nIf anymore information is required, feel free to contact me.
