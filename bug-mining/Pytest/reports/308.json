I'm now getting:\r\n\r\n```\r\npytest.PytestDeprecationWarning: The hookimpl pytest_configure uses old-style configuration options (marks or attributes).\r\nPlease use the pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True) decorator instead\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith no easy way to figure out what the problem is. I have 12 plugins installed, all of which might have a `pytest_configure`, and I'd rather not have to find out manually which one is the culprit. The error message should show either the plugin that's coming from, or at least the Python file it's in.","closed_by":{"login":"RonnyPfannschmidt","id":156838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt","html_url":"https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonnyPfannschmidt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
