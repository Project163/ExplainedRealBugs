in https://github.com/ClearcodeHQ/pytest-postgresql/issues/533#issuecomment-999567968 via #9415:\r\n\r\nDoing e.g. `python3 -c \"import pytest; pytest.TempdirFactory\"` fails since  5e883f51959f900fcf985493ce2d09e07bad7e00. This is a bit similar to #9396, but #9400 won't help with this one.\r\n\r\nTest modules often use `pytest.TempdirFactory` for type annotations - in fact, that's why [that was added](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html#improvements) in 6.2.0.\r\n\r\nHowever, it being set from a plugin means that:\r\n\r\na) Test modules aren't even importable anymore outside of pytest - in case of `pytest-postgresql`, this [breaks an importability check](https://github.com/ClearcodeHQ/pytest-postgresql/runs/4607221002?check_suite_focus=true), but I can imagine various other things breaking...\r\nb) Perhaps more importantly, static analysis in IDEs or tools like mypy [aren't aware anymore](https://github.com/ClearcodeHQ/pytest-postgresql/runs/4607221090?check_suite_focus=true) that the attribute exists - however, after all, that's *the whole point* of it existing, and [lots of projects use it that way](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+:%5C+*%28pytest%5C.%29%3FTempdirFactory+lang:python+-file:pytester.py&patternType=regexp). (Some import it from `_pytest.tmpdir`, probably because they did that before 6.2.0 - I'm not too worried about those, they knew what they're in for)\r\n\r\nReproducer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pytest import TempdirFactory\r\n\r\ndef test_nothing(tmpdir: TempdirFactory):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nFails with mypy:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_x.py:1: error: Module \"pytest\" has no attribute \"TempdirFactory\"; maybe \"TempPathFactory\"?\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat to do? I suppose as a stop-gap until we want to distribute the plugin independently from pytest, we could import the class from the plugin or
