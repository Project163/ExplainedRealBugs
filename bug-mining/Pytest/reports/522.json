Knowing this beforehand would have spared me a lot of ugly `assert np.isallclose(a,b)`. I don't think me not knowing about the existence of this function beforehand is my fault because I read the [Get Started](https://web.archive.org/web/20250729202655/https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html), [How to write and report assertions in tests](https://web.archive.org/web/20250717083245/https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html), and [How to use fixtures](https://web.archive.org/web/20250728201605/https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/fixtures.html) pages, which I feel like should be enough to start writing tests and have a general idea of what the package is capable of.\n\nSince so many people use Python for scientific computing, I reckon it would be good to at least mention the existence of `pytest.approx()` in the \"How to write and report assertions in tests\" guide. Honestly, the fact that it works so well with numpy arrays, even those including `NaN`s, makes this function a selling point of `pytest` in my books, so I would argue it could even be included in the \"Get Started\" page.\n\nIf you agree with me that a reference to `pytest.approx()` should be added to the \"How to write and report assertions\" guide and/or the \"Get Started\" page (and you tell me which of these 2 pages should be modified), I'd be more than happy to change the doc myself.\n\nWhat do you all think about it?","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13662/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
