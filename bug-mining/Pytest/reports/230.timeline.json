@htgoebel,\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay.\r\n\r\n> You can actually use the setup provided by PyInstaller\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the detailed and reproducible example, however I'm having trouble with Vagrant on my computer so those steps are not working for me right now (it gives an error trying to rsync the internal paths).\r\n\r\nLooking at the error message, the cause of the problem is the `os.path.samefile` call in this block:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/634cde9506eb1f48dec3ec77974ee8dc952207c6/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L523-L537\r\n\r\nSo can you please try:\r\n\r\n1. Set `PY_IGNORE_IMPORTMISMATCH=1`. This is a escape hatch of this mismatch mechanism, this should make the problem go away.\r\n\r\n2. Can you try this branch: https://github.com/nicoddemus/pytest/tree/same-path-unc-7678? Installing it directly together with the editable install should do the trick:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   pip install -e . git+https://github.com/nicoddemus/pytest@same-path-unc-7678\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   If this works, I will introduce that fix into pytest itself.\r\n\r\nThanks!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/691483602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3759321944,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc1OTMyMTk0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/3759321944","actor":{"login":"htgoebel","id":784161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDE2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/784161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel","html_url":"https://github.com/htgoebel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-12T12:53:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3759321946,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3NTkzMjE5NDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/events/3759321946","actor":{"login":"htgoebel","id":784161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDE2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/784161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel","html_url":"https://github.com/htgoebel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htgoebel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-12T12:53:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/comments/691483628","html_url":"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7678#issuecomment-691483628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7678","id":691483628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MTQ4MzYyOA==","user":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-12T12:54:10Z","u
