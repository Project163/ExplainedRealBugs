when running pytest:\r\n`PytestAssertRewriteWarning: Module already imported so cannot be rewritten: plugin`\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Create a local plugin, e.g. empty `plugin.py` file.\r\n- Create a test that includes the plugin via `pytest_plugins` and also imports the plugin:\r\n```python\r\nimport plugin\r\npytest_plugins = (\"plugin\",)\r\n```\r\n- Run the tests:\r\n```\r\n$pytest test.py\r\n=============================================== test session starts ================================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.8.10, pytest-7.4.0, pluggy-1.2.0\r\nrootdir: /home/legaul/tmp/pytest-issue\r\ncollected 0 items\r\n\r\n================================================= warnings summary

================================================\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Extra information\r\n\r\nObviously this is a contrived minimal example; a more realistic scenario is:\r\n- `conftest.py` contains `pytest_plugins = (...)`\r\n- Some indirect import of the plugin, e.g. for the purpose of type annotations\r\n\r\nThis is not seen when loading the plugin using `pytest -p plugin` instead (since the import happens earlier?).\r\n\r\nPerhaps related to
