What's the problem this feature will solve?\r\nWhen running large test suites like `pyca/cryptography` we see significant (up to 40%!) slowdown on some jobs when capturing is enabled. However, enabling capture disables \"progress\" , which in turn results in extraordinarily long lines on GitHub Actions, which breaks browsers' ability to load CI output.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIn #3038 the \"progress\" output was disabled when capture=no (defaulting back to classic) because any extraneous stdout/stderr from the tests will mess up the output. However, for users who are willing to risk accidentally leaving code that might write to stdout/stderr it would be great to support a flag that would re-enable progress info.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Solutions\r\n* Capturing could possibly be made (much) faster, thus negating the desire to disable it to gain performance.\r\n* A new output style could exist which limits line lengths but does not attempt to do \"progress\" style fancy output.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10737/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
