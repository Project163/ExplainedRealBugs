So the open question is, when should ``tracemalloc.start()`` be called and how to pass the size of the stack trace to it, as the default of ``1`` is often too small (I needed 20 to find the source of an unclosed requests Response). I propose three possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Document running pytest like this: ``python -X tracemalloc=20 -m pytest ...``\r\n2. Add a command line option to enable ``tracemalloc`` with the limit as parameter.\r\n3. Enable tracing when warnings for ``ResourceWarning`` are set to ``once`` or ``always`` and always use a stack trace limit of ``3``.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicoddemus","id":1085180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODUxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoddemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoddemus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
