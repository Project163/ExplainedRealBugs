can not understand the solution proposed by @untitaker. In my opinion, the purpose of test inheritance is that the new test class will contain all tests from parent classes.

In my opinion, every test in the new class is separate and should be explicitly marked by the user.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\n@pytest.mark.mark1\r\nclass Test1:\r\n    @pytest.mark.mark2\r\n
