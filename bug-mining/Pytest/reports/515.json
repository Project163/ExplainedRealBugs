This is probably a cpython bug.\r\n\r\nNoticed on both `windows-py35` and `windows-py37` jobs at least. (Update: also on `pypy3-ubuntu`).\r\n\r\nFor now I think we should just skip it on Windows, unless anyone has better ideas or ability to investigate. I'll send a PR doing that.","closed_by":{"login":"bluetech","id":1223550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech","html_url":"https://github.com/bluetech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluetech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7022/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
