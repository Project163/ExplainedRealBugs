I understand the arguments for not extending `pytest.raises` to automatically unwrap `ExceptionGroups`as discussed in https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11538 I've tried to use the `ExceptionInfo.group_contains()` method which works well enough for the runtime parts.\n\nHowever since the return value of `raises()` ( `ExceptionInfo`) is generic in the exception type, the stricter type-checkers will complain about the unknown type-argument of the `ExceptionGroup`.\n\n```python\n# pyright: strict\n\nimport pytest\nimport sys\nfrom typing import cast\n\nif sys.version_info < (3, 11):\n    from exceptiongroup import ExceptionGroup\n\nclass FooError(Exception):\n    pass\n\n# Pyright will report an error for the code below as:\n# Type of \"exc_group_info\" is partially unknown\n#   Type of \"exc_group_info\" is \"ExceptionInfo[ExceptionGroup]\"PylancereportUnknownVariableType\nwith pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup) as exc_group_info:\n    raise ExceptionGroup(\"Some error occured\", [FooError(\"Error\")])\n\nassert exc_group_info.group_contains(FooError)\n```\n\nIf trying to rectify this by supplying the type-argument  it fails various checks in `raises` that checks that the argument is an instance of `type` which `GenericAlias` (that you get when indexing a  generic class) is not.\n\n```python\n# If the type is added pyright is ok but the runtime is not:\n# Traceback (most recent call last):\n#  File \".../test.py\", line 21, in <module>\n#    with pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup[ExceptionGroup[FooError]]) as exc_group_info:\n#         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n#  File \".../.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/_pytest/python_api.py\", line 959, in raises\n#    raise TypeError(msg.format(not_a))\n# TypeError: expected exception must be a BaseException type, not GenericAlias\nwith pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup[ExceptionGroup[FooError]]) as exc_group_info:\n    raise ExceptionGroup(\"Some error occured\", [FooError(\"Error\")])\n\nassert exc_group_info.group_contains(FooError)\n```\n\nThe correct casting that is required to get this correct would have to be something like below.\n```python\n# With the cast we can get it to work but that is quite verbose and doesn't\n# catch errors of BaseExceptionGroup  vs ExceptionGroup in the cast for example.\nwith pytest.raises(cast(type[ExceptionGroup[FooError]], ExceptionGroup)) as exc_group_info:\n    raise ExceptionGroup(\"Some error occured\", [FooError(\"Error\")])\n\nassert exc_group_info.group_contains(FooError)\n```\n\nThis could probably be fixed by handling generic Exceptions (or at least ExceptionGroups) explicitly in raises using https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.get_origin.\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"Zac-HD","id":12229877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjI5ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12229877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD","html_url":"https://github.com/Zac-HD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zac-HD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13115/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
