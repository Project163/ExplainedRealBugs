It is mentioned in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17434031/parametrizing-test-classes-in-pytest/ (the second answer) and it works, but I cannot find it hinted at https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/doc/en/example/parametrize.rst . All the existing example involving classes are way too complicated for the particular usage I am looking for.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('x', [1, 2])\r\nclass TestMe:\r\n    def test_1(self, x):\r\n        print(f'test 1: {x}')\r\n\r\n    def test_2(self, x):\r\n        print(f'test 2: {x}')\r\n```\r\n\r\ngives me correctly:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest 1: 1\r\ntest 1: 2\r\ntest 2: 1\r\ntest 2: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut since it is not documented, is it only working by accident? Or it is actually supported?\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable and how it solves the problem described above. -->\r\n\r\nDocument it if it is actually a supported usage.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Solutions\r\n<!-- Have you tried to workaround the problem using a pytest plugin or other tools? Or a different approach to solving this issue?
