The issue seems to occur if there is a malformed `pyproject.toml` file in a parent directory (which I had several levels higher up in my directory tree). I don't think failing in this case itself is necessarily an issue, but the error message gives no clue as to what the problem is other than implying that it's a file somewhere.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n```bash\r\n$ pytest\r\n============================= test session starts ==============================\r\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.9.9, pytest-7.0.1, pluggy-1.0.0\r\nrootdir: /Users/richard/tmp/testpytest/testdir\r\nplugins: anyio-2.2.0\r\ncollected 0 items\r\n\r\n============================ no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\r\n\r\n$ echo \"\\\"\" > ../pyproject.toml\r\n\r\n$ pytest\r\nERROR: Illegal character '\\n' (at line 1, column 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEarlier versions of pytest (tested 6.1.2) did not seem to have quite the same problem as they at least gave the stack trace from the TOML parser which have a slightly better hint what the problem was.
