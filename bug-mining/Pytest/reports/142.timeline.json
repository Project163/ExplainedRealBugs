@fiendish,\r\n\r\nIndeed this is a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nCurrently `ExceptionInfo` objects (which is `pytest.raises` returns to the context manager) implements `__str__` like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/9f8b566ea976df3a3ea16f74b56dd6d4909b84ee/src/_pytest/_code/code.py#L537-L542\r\n\r\nI don't see much use for this, I would rather it didn't implement `__str__` at all and let `__repr__` take over, which would show something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ExceptionInfo LookupError tb=10>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich makes it more obvious that this is not what the user intended with `str(e)` probably.\r\n\r\nSo I think a good solution is to simply delete the `__str__` method.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nAlso, @fiendish which Python version are you

test has started failing consistently on the OSX builds, and the\ncause is a pytest major release that dropped on June 28. Travis' Ubuntu\nvirtual machines come with an older version of pytest included, and we do not\nforce it to upgrade, so we have only encountered this on the OSX builds\nso far.\n\nThe usage\n\n```python\nwith pytest.raises(Exception) as exc\n```\n\nputs an [``ExceptionInfo``](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#exceptioninfo)\nobject into ``exc``, not the exception itself. We were trying ``exc``\nlike an exception object and relying on the fact that\n``ExceptionInfo.__str__`` returned the same thing as ``exc.__str__``\nwould. The\n[pytest 5.0.0 release](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/changelog.html#pytest-5-0-0-2019-06-28)\nbroke that assumption. See
