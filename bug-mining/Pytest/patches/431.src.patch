 Broadly speaking, a flaky test indicates that the test relies on some system state that is not being appropriately controlled - the test environment is not sufficiently isolated. Higher level tests are more likely to be flaky as they rely on more state.

-Pytest features
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+pytest is single-threaded, executing its tests always in the same thread, sequentially, never spawning any threads itself.
+
+Even in case of plugins which run tests in parallel, for example `pytest-xdist`_, usually work by spawning multiple *processes* and running tests in batches, without using multiple threads.
+
+It is of course possible (and common) for tests and fixtures to spawn threads themselves as part of their testing workflow (for example, a fixture that starts a server thread in the background, or a test which executes production code that spawns threads), but some care must be taken:
+
+* Make sure to eventually wait on any spawned threads -- for example at the end of a test, or during the teardown of a fixture.
+* Avoid using primitives provided by pytest (:func:`pytest.warns`, :func:`pytest.raises`, etc) from multiple threads, as they are not thread-safe.
+
+If your test suite uses threads and your are seeing flaky test results, do not discount the possibility that the test is implicitly using global state in pytest itself.
