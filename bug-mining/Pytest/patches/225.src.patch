 - `#5416 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416>`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.
 
 
+pytest 4.6.11 (2020-06-04)
+==========================
+
+Bug Fixes
+---------
+
+- `#6334 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6334>`_: Fix summary entries appearing twice when ``f/F`` and ``s/S`` report chars were used at the same time in the ``-r`` command-line option (for example ``-rFf``).
+
+  The upper case variants were never documented and the preferred form should be the lower case.
+
+
+- `#7310 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7310>`_: Fix ``UnboundLocalError: local variable 'letter' referenced before
+  assignment`` in ``_pytest.terminal.pytest_report_teststatus()``
+  when plugins return report objects in an unconventional state.
+
+  This was making ``pytest_report_teststatus()`` skip
+  entering if-block branches that declare the ``letter`` variable.
+
+  The fix was to set the initial value of the ``letter`` before
+  the if-block cascade so that it always has a value.
+
+
+pytest 4.6.10 (2020-05-08)
+==========================
+
+Features
+--------
+
+- `#6870 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6870>`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.
+
+  Remark: while this is technically a new feature and according to our `policy <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html#what-goes-into-4-6-x-releases>`_ it should not have been backported, we have opened an exception in this particular case because it fixes a serious interaction with ``pytest-xdist``, so it can also be considered a bugfix.
+
+Trivial/Internal Changes
+------------------------
+
+- `#6404 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6404>`_: Remove usage of ``parser`` module, deprecated in Python 3.9.
