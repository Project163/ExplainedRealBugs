+    Given an iterable of file names in a source distribution, return the "names" that should
+    be marked for assertion rewrite (for example the package "pytest_mock/__init__.py" should
+    be added as "pytest_mock" in the assertion rewrite mechanism.
+
+    This function has to deal with dist-info based distributions and egg based distributions
+    (which are still very much in use for "editable" installs).
+
+    Here are the file names as seen in a dist-info based distribution:
+
+        pytest_mock/__init__.py
+        pytest_mock/_version.py
+        pytest_mock/plugin.py
+        pytest_mock.egg-info/PKG-INFO

+        src/pytest_mock/__init__.py
+        src/pytest_mock/_version.py
+        src/pytest_mock/plugin.py
+        src/pytest_mock.egg-info/PKG-INFO
+        LICENSE
+        setup.py
+
+    We have to take in account those two distribution flavors in order to determine which
+    names should be considered for assertion rewriting.
