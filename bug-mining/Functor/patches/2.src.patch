-        The <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/package-summary.html">aggregator package</a> 
-        provides a component which can be "fed" data from various sources and apply various 
-        computations to this data to "aggregate" it. The design allows for a pluggable 
-        implementation to be used for the purpose of aggregation and also provides flexibility
-        with regards to storing the data being fed to this component.
-        <br/>
-        There are 2 implementations as far as storage is concerned : <i>nostore</i> and 
-        <code>ArrayList</code>-backed store. The former should be used when the aggregation 
-        formula is simple enough to be applied on-the-fly without having to traverse a series 
-        of data -- e.g. summarizing / adding the data (TODO need more explanation). 
-      </p>
-    </section>  
-    
-    <section name="Storage">
-      <p>The <code>ArrayList</code>-backed store implementation stores the whole data series in a
-      growing <code>ArrayList</code> such that when data is aggregated one can traverse the
-      series and apply complex formulas (find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"
-      target="_blank">median</a> of a set of numeric values for instance).
-      </p>
-      
-      <p>While the <i>store</i> implementation stores the data in a list, the <i>nostore</i> one
-      stores just a single object -- every time data is fed into the <code>Aggregator</code>, 
-      the data stored in this object and the data 
-      <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/Aggregator.html#add(T)">passed in</a> 
-      are "aggregated" there and then using the supplied formula and the result of this operation
-      is stored back in the object this implementation uses to store data.
-      <br/>
-      This has the implication that unlike the list-backed storage implementation (where the

-      is called) with the <i>nostore</i> implementation the result is known (and saved back) at
-      any moment. This arguably makes this class "faster", however this comes at the cost of a
-      slower <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/Aggregator.html#add(T)">add()</a>
-      operation, as the aggregation formula is applied. Also, let's remind ourselves that not all
-      formulas can be implemented using the <i>nostore</i> implementation (see above).

-    <section name="Flushing Data">
-      <p>
-      	The data an aggregator handles can be "reset" at any point -- in the case of the
-      	<i>store</i> implementation this means emptying the <code>ArrayList</code>; in the case
-      	of <i>nostore</i> this means setting the "start value" to a "neutral" value -- for
-      	instance 0 for implementations which involve additions (<code>Y + 0 = Y</code>), 1 for 
-      	multiplication (<code>Y * 1 = Y</code>) etc. This operation ultimately resets the
-      	aggregator to the initial state it was in when created in the first place. This feature 
-      	allows for a caller to schedule regular resets to free up resources etc.
-      </p>
-    </section>
-    
-    <section name="Timers">
-      <p>
-      	Retrieving the data and regular intervals then flush/reset the aggregator was an
-      	envisaged scenario for the aggregator -- so the base class 
-      	<a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractTimedAggregator.html">AbstractTimedAggregator</a>
-      	offers support to start a timer internally to do that. The class offers a <i>listener</i> 
-      	mechanism where classes can register to receive <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/TimedAggregatorListener">timer notifications</a> (if timer support was configured) and after all listeners have been 
-      	notified the aggregator is <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/Aggregator.html#reset()">reset</a>.
-      	The result of 
-      	<a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/Aggregator.html#evaluate()">evaluate()</a>
-      	(the result of aggregating data) is passed in to the listeners. This allows for an object 
-      	to simply register itself as a timer listener to the aggregator and only react to the
-      	timer notifications (e.g. write the result to a file for offline analysis etc) while the
-      	aggregator itself manages all the internals.
-      </p>
-      
-      <p>
-      	There are 2 ways the 
-      	<a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractTimedAggregator.html">AbstractTimedAggregator</a> 
-      	can be configured with timer support:
-      </p>
-      	<ul>
-      		<li><b>Using a per-instance timer</b> : by default, when using the 
-      		<a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractTimedAggregator.html#AbstractTimedAggregator(long)">1
-      		parameter constructor</a> with a value &gt; 0, the aggregator will create a 
-      		<code>Timer</code> object internally and schedule the regular task of resetting the 
-      		aggregator under this <code>Timer</code>. While this helps preventing memory leaks 
-      		(both <code>Aggregator</code> and <code>Timer</code> will be recycled together) it
-      		does increase the threading level in the system with each aggregator object created.
-      		If your system creates a lot of <code>AbstractTimedAggregator</code> instances with
-      		timer support, you might want to consider using the shared timer (see below).</li>
-      		<li><b>Using a shared timer</b> : the <a
-      		href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractTimedAggregator.html">AbstractTimedAggregator</a>
-      		class creates a <a
-      		href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractTimedAggregator.html#MAIN_TIMER">static 
-      		timer instance</a> which can be shared amongst all instances of this class, if using 
-      		<a
-      		href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractTimedAggregator.html#AbstractTimedAggregator(long, boolean)">the 
-      		constructor with 2 params</a>. When doing so, each such instance will schedule its
-      		regular reset task against this timer. While this reduces the memory footprint and
-      		threading on the system, it can lead to memory leaks if this is not handled correctly.
-      		Therefore please make sure you invoke <a
-      		href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractTimedAggregator.html#stop()">stop()</a>
-      		on such aggregators when finished working with them.</li>
-      	</ul>
-      <p>
-		It is recommended you always invoke <a
-      	href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractTimedAggregator.html#stop()">stop()</a>
-      	at the end of the lifecycle of an aggregator -- regardless of timer support (shared / 
-      	per instance) or not -- in particular calling <code>stop()</code> on an aggregator with
-      	no timer support has no effect, however doing so ensures code uniformity and cleanliness.
-      </p>

-    
-    <section name="Examples">
-      <p>An example of usage for this component (though not necessarily the only one) could be in
-      a highly transactional system where, for instance, the average transaction time can be an
-      indication of the system health. While a fully-fledged monitoring system can say monitor
-      the system load, file system etc., you might also want your monitoring system to keep an
-      eye on the average transaction time. One way to do so is have an <a
-      href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractTimedAggregator.html">AbstractTimedAggregator</a> 
-      which is capturing each transaction execution time and every say 5 seconds it computes
-      the arithmetic mean (average) and writes that to a log file (which then your monitoring
-      system can tail). To do so you would use a piece of code like this:
-      </p>
-      
-      <source>
-public class AggregatorTesting implements TimedAggregatorListener&lt;Double&gt; {
-    Aggregator&lt;Double&gt; agg;
-
-    public AggregatorTesting() {
-        AbstractTimedAggregator&lt;Double&gt; aggregator = new ArrayListBackedAggregator&lt;Double&gt;(new DoubleMeanValueAggregatorFunction(),
-                5000L);
-        aggregator.addTimerListener(this);
-        this.agg = aggregator;
-    }
-
-    @Override
-    public void onTimer(AbstractTimedAggregator&lt;Double&gt; aggregator) {
-        double aggregated = aggregator.evaluate();
-        /* log the value etc. */
-    }
-
-    private void add(double d) {
-        agg.add(d);
-    }
-
-    public static void main(String[] args) {
-        AggregatorTesting t = new AggregatorTesting();
-        /* add data */
-        t.add( 1.0 );
-        t.add( 2.0 );
-        /* .. */
-    }
-}      
-      </source>
-      
-      <p>Now let's assume that you occasionally see the odd spike in transaction times -- which,
-      for the purpose of this example, we'll assume is normal. As such you are not concerned with
-      these spikes, so you want a formula to exclude them. Chances are an arithmetic median
-      would be more appropriate in this case; in which case the code above can suffer just a
-      small change:
-      </p>
-      
-      <source>
-      ...
-        AbstractTimedAggregator&lt;Double&gt; aggregator = new ArrayListBackedAggregator&lt;Double&gt;(new DoubleMedianValueAggregatorFunction(),
-                5000L);
-       ...
-      </source>
-
-      <p>Or maybe you want to be more precise and ensure that lets say 95% of your transactions
-      take less than a certain execution time, so you replace the median formula with a 
-      percentile one:
-      </p>
-      
-      <source>
-      ...
-        AbstractTimedAggregator&lt;Double&gt; aggregator = new ArrayListBackedAggregator&lt;Double&gt;(new DoublePercentileAggregatorFunction(95),
-                5000L);
-       ...
-      </source>
-      
-      <p>Or maybe your health indicator is the number of transactions going through the system
-      every 5 seconds. In this case you can use a <i>nostore</i> aggregator with a sum formula 
-      like this:
-      </p>
-
-      <source>
-public class AggregatorTesting implements TimedAggregatorListener&lt;Double&gt; {
-    Aggregator&lt;Double&gt; agg;
-
-    public AggregatorTesting() {
-        AbstractTimedAggregator&lt;Double&gt; aggregator = new AbstractNoStoreAggregator&lt;Double&gt;(
-                new DoubleSumAggregatorFunction2(), 5000L) {
-            @Override
-            protected Double initialValue() {
-                return 0.0;
-            }
-        };
-        aggregator.addTimerListener(this);
-        this.agg = aggregator;
-    }
-
-    @Override
-    public void onTimer(AbstractTimedAggregator&lt;Double&gt; aggregator) {
-        double aggregated = aggregator.evaluate();
-        /* log the value etc. */
-    }
-
-    private void add(double d) {
-        agg.add(d);
-    }
-
-    public static void main(String[] args) {
-        AggregatorTesting t = new AggregatorTesting();
-        /* add data */
-        t.add(1.0);
-        t.add(2.0);
-        /* .. */
-    }
-}
-      </source>
-      
-      <p>(Bear in mind that there is also a <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/functions/IntCountAggregatorFunction2.html">IntCountAggregatorFunction2</a> too!)
-      </p>
-      
-      <p>This has the advantage of a lower memory footprint as well (see above). If your healthcheck
-      indicator is based on the maximum transaction time over a 5 seconds interval, then you simply
-      replace the <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractNoStoreAggregator.html#getAggregationFunction()">aggregation function</a> with a max value implementation:
-      </p>
-      
-      <source>
-      ...
-        AbstractTimedAggregator&lt;Double&gt; aggregator = new AbstractNoStoreAggregator&lt;Double&gt;(
-                new DoubleMaxAggregatorFunction2(), 5000L) {
-      ...
-      </source>
-      
-	  <p>Or you can simply roll out your own code -- if using the <i>nostore</i> implementation,
-	  all you need to do is implement a 
-	  <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/BinaryFunction.html">BinaryFunction</a> and pass
-	  it to the <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractNoStoreAggregator.html#AbstractNoStoreAggregator(org.apache.commons.functor.BinaryFunction)">Aggregator constructor</a>. This function will receive the already-stored
-	  aggregated value as the first parameter, and data just passed in (via <a
-	  href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/Aggregator.html#add(T)">add()</a>) as the
-	  second parameter; the result of this function will be stored back in the aggregator.
-	  <br/>
-	  For the list-based aggregators, use an instance of <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractListBackedAggregator.html">AbstractListBackedAggregator</a> and pass in an instance of <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/UnaryFunction.html">UnaryFunction</a>
-	  which accepts a <code>List</code> and returns a single object.
-	  <br/>
-	  Have a look at the 
-	  <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/functions/package-summary.html">org.apache.commons.functor.aggregate.functions package</a> which includes a set of functions to achieve 
-	  various of these tasks already.
-	  </p>
-	  
-	  <p><b>Note on class naming</b> : You will notice in the <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/functions/package-summary.html">org.apache.commons.functor.aggregate.functions package</a> there are functions with similar names -- e.g.
-	  <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/functions/DoubleSumAggregatorFunction.html">DoubleSumAggregatorFunction</a> and <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/functions/DoubleSumAggregatorFunction2.html">DoubleSumAggregatorFunction2</a>. The naming convention is that if the function takes 2
-	  parameters (i.e. it is an instance of <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/BinaryFunction.html">BinaryFunction</a> then the
-	  name of the class in this package will end in <code>2</code>, otherwise, if it is an instance
-	  of <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/UnaryFunction.html">UnaryFunction</a> then the
-	  name will not end in a <code>2</code>.<br/>
-	  The reason behind it is that instances of <code>BinaryFunction</code> can be used with
-	  <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/aggregate/AbstractNoStoreAggregator.html">AbstractNoStoreAggregator</a> whereas the instances of <code>UnaryFunction</code> can be used

-            There are some code snippets / examples for the <code>org.apache.commons.functor.aggregator</code> package
-            available on <a href="aggregator.html">this page</a>. Also, to exemplify the usage of the <code>Aggregator</code>
-            classes, there are code examples in the test section.
-            <br/>
-            First such set of example involves the usage of the <i>nostore</i> <code>Aggregator</code>. Code can be found in

-            This shows how can you use an aggregator which doesn't store the data series and processes them on the fly.
-            Also, there are examples provided which show how can you implement your own aggregation function
-            to be used with this <code>Aggregator</code> type.

-            For using an <code>Aggregator</code> which stores the data series in a list, examples are in

-            This shows how can you use the <code>ArrayList</code>-backed aggregator or provide your own <code>List</code>-based implementation.

-      <subsection name="Reuse Through Composition">
-         <p>
-            The Functor package, and more generally, a functional approach
-            to program design, supports a powerful technique for balancing
-            behavior specialization and code reuse.
-         </p>
-         <p>
-            Traditional Object Oriented design suggests inheritence as a
-            mechanism code reuse, and method overloading as a mechanism for
-            specialization.  For example, one defines a general purpose, perhaps
-            even abstract class, say <i>AbstractList</i>, and then extend or
-            specialize this parent via subclasses, inheriting some behaviors
-            and overloading others.
-         </p>
-         <p>
-            Functors encourage another, complementary approach to code reuse
-            and behavior specialiazation: composition.  Following a compositional
-            design, we create a number of simple objects and then combine them to
-            create more complex behaviors.  For example, the
-            <a href="http://commons.apache.org/pool/">Commons Pool</a>
-            component defines an <code>ObjectPool</code> type that maintains
-            a collection of pooled objects, but delegates to a
-            <code>PoolableObjectFactory</code> to create, validate and destroy
-            the objects to be pooled.  Arbitrary <code>ObjectPool</code>
-            implementations can be composed with arbitrary
-            <code>PoolableObjectFactory</code>
-            implementations in order to create new types of pools.
