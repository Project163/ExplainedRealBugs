 Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n/closes https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7007\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nAdding support of providing custom labels during install/update of release that could be used for selector filtering introduced in https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8532.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\nThis PR focused on adding custom label support during install/upgrade actions.\r\nThere was similar PRs before that, unfortunately, haven't been finished: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8546 https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8099 https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/9087\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm trying to make changes as small as possible, to make development and review easier.\r\nMy goal is to make selector functionality in the list command useable for install/upgrade actions with secret and configmap storage drivers.\r\n\r\nI don't want to add SQL support in this particular PR, cause it seems it would at least double the number of changes.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\nFunctionality (support labels argument during following actions):\r\n- [x] install\r\n- [x] upgrade --install\r\n- [x] upgrade (basic)\r\n- [x] upgrade (keep labels on superseded releases)\r\n- [x] tests for new functionality (don't know how to implement it better)\r\n- [x] Secret storage driver\r\n- [x] Configmap storage driver\r\n\r\nNot planned in this PR:\r\n- [x] SQL - support is not currently planned in this PR. But there are some related developments in https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8546 that could be prepared as separate PR later.\r\n- [x] Merge original release labels with upgrade labels\r\n\r\n**UPD**:\r\nNow I have implemented even features I haven't planned for this PR. So right now this PR is completely ready for review.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested why I've created a separate DB table (in SQL driver) for custom releases - my idea was that some day we may want to make release filtering on storage backend side (k8s and SQL support requests with filtering by labels/joined table). so I decided that it would be better to split it to a separate table instead of having it encoded somewhere in json, because data migration is always annoying.\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [x] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/10533/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/10533/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/1743731938","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12435#issuecomment-1743731938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/12435","id":1743731938,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApspmc5n7zzi","user":{"login":"hiddeco","id":10063039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzMDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10063039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco","html_url":"https://github.com/hiddeco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiddeco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-02T20:40:30Z","updated_at":"2023-10-02T20:40:30Z","body":"Reason

Helm versions prior to 3.13.1 (for example 3.12.3) it was possible to list Helm releases by label selector, for example by Helm release name.\r\n\r\nIf I install a simple chart like incubator/raw like this:\r\n```\r\n$ helm repo add incubator https://charts.helm.sh/incubator\r\n\"incubator\" has been added to your repositories\r\n$ helm upgrade -i raw incubator/raw\r\nRelease \"raw\" does not exist.

None\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I then use label selector _name=raw_ using Helm 3.13.1 it does not find any the previously installed raw release:\r\n```\r\n$ helm version\r\nversion.BuildInfo{Version:\"v3.13.1\", GitCommit:\"3547a4b5bf5edb5478ce352e18858d8a552a4110\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", GoVersion:\"go1.20.8\"}\r\n$ helm list -l name=raw\r\nNAME\tNAMESPACE\tREVISION\tUPDATED\tSTATUS\tCHART\tAPP VERSION\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever if I downgrade Helm to 3.12.3 then the raw release is found:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ helm
