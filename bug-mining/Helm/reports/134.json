repo, and running \n\n```\nhelm template --debug test 5_deeply_nested_chart\n```\n\nThe output contains 2 copies of the error message (I'll add extra newlines to make it more pronounced):\n\n```\ninstall.go:225: 2025-05-13 12:56:28.070458592 -0400 EDT m=+0.021712978 [debug] Original chart version: \"\"\ninstall.go:242: 2025-05-13 12:56:28.070488292 -0400 EDT m=+0.021742668

messages are located\n\nThe log line from the `--debug` output that contains the error message is located here:\nhttps://github.com/helm/helm/blob/b2456202aedb10b0d6be5d6d320d8428bb932400/cmd/helm/helm.go#L44\nAnd is sent to stdout\n\nThe error message that comes before it, that would be outputted even without the `--debug` flag, is set by spf13/cobra, and can be silenced by adding `SilenceErrors` inside each of the `Command` structs (ex. template.go).\nAnd is sent to stderr.\n\n## Possible ways this could be valuable to keep both\n\nthe debug log line is sent in a structured format, and it's possible that other applications may read and query from these types of log lines.  Yet a human is more likely to want to read the error message above it, since it would be formatted (if https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/13586 is merged). So it's possible one could be a human-readable error, and the other is expected to be machine-readable.  I'm not sure `--debug` is intended to be interpreted this way, though.  \n\n(may add more as I think of it.)\n\n## Things I considered\n\n1.  Maybe it's best to set `SilenceErrors = true` when `--debug` is enabled.  \n2. Maybe we just keep both error messages in\n3. Maybe we just remove the debug log line, since it's redundant.\n","closed_by":{"login":"robertsirc","id":13884882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg0ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13884882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc","html_url":"https://github.com/robertsirc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsirc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/30857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/30857/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
