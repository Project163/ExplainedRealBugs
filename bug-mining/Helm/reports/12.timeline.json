What Happened?\n\nHelm releases using CRDs shipping with the chart frequently mostly fail for me using the kvm2 driver  (Cannot reproduce the issues with the docker driver, but I need kvm2 driver for the disks).\n\nFor example:\n\n```sh\nminikube --cpus=4 --memory=8g --driver=kvm2 --network=default --profile demo start --wait=all\n# Adding the following line  pretty much gets around the issue\n# sleep 60\nhelm upgrade -i olm oci://ghcr.io/cloudtooling/helm-charts/olm --debug --version 0.30.0\n```\nThe issue is not related to cluster creation. It is just very reproducible for me this way.\n\nIt fails because CRDs are not available at resource creation time, even though\nthe actual CRD creation succeeds. I understand helm 3 may not be perfect with regards to CRDs and there have been somewhat similar issues in the past, such as [Helm v3 beta -- Wait for CRDs to be created #6316\n](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6316).\n\nBelow is a small `Makefile` to reproduce conveniently:\n\n```make\nMINIKUBE_START_ARGS=--cpus=4 --memory=8g --driver=kvm2 --network=default\n# MINIKUBE_START_ARGS=--cpus=2 --driver=docker\n\n.DEFAULT_GOAL := help\n\n.PHONY: help\nhelp:  ## Display this help\n        @awk 'BEGIN {FS = \":.*##\"; printf \"\\nUsage:\\n  make \\033[36m<target>\\033[0m\\n\"} /^[a-zA-Z_0-9-]+:.*?##/ { printf \"  \\033[36m%-20s\\033[0m %s\\n\", $$1, $$2 } /^##@/ { printf \"\\n\\033[1m%s\\033[0m\\n\", substr($$0, 5) } ' $(MAKEFILE_LIST)\n\n\n.PHONY: apply-demo\napply-demo: ## Apply demo \n        minikube $(MINIKUBE_START_ARGS) --profile demo start --wait=all\n        kubectl get pod -A\n        minikube --profile demo ssh \"ps -axww\"\n        # The following line can be used to work around the issue with the kvm2 driver\n        # sleep 60\n        helm upgrade -i olm oci://ghcr.io/cloudtooling/helm-charts/olm --debug --version 0.30.0 || kubectl explain OLMConfig || true\n        sleep 10\n        kubectl explain OLMConfig\n\n.PHONY: destroy-demo\ndestroy-demo: ## Destroy Demo\n        minikube --profile demo delete\n```\n\nBelow is the output of\n\n```sh\nmake apply-demo\n```\n\n```\nminikube --cpus=4 --memory=8g --driver=kvm2 --network=default --profile demo start --wait=all\n* [demo] minikube v1.35.0 on Ubuntu 24.04\n* Using the kvm2 driver based on user configuration\n* Starting \"demo\" primary control-plane node in \"demo\" cluster\n* Creating kvm2 VM (CPUs=4, Memory=8192MB, Disk=20000MB) ...\n* Preparing Kubernetes v1.32.0 on Docker 27.4.0 ...\n  - Generating certificates and keys ...\n  - Booting up control plane ...\n  - Configuring RBAC rules ...\n* Configuring bridge CNI (Container Networking Interface) ...\n* Verifying Kubernetes components...\n  - Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5\n* Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass\n* Done! kubectl is now configured to use \"demo\" cluster and \"default\" namespace by default\nkubectl get pod -A\nNAMESPACE     NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkube-system   coredns-668d6bf9bc-dnmrw       1/1     Running   0          9s\nkube-system   etcd-demo                      1/1     Running   0          15s\nkube-system   kube-apiserver-demo            1/1     Running   0          15s\nkube-system   kube-controller-manager-demo   1/1     Running   0          15s\nkube-system   kube-proxy-wggrm               1/1     Running   0          10s\nkube-system   kube-scheduler-demo            1/1     Running   0          15s\nkube-system   storage-provisioner            1/1     Running   0          9s\nminikube --profile demo ssh \"ps -axww\"\n    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\n      1 ?
