Frequent use case for which `--reuse-values` works very counter-intuitive is **adding new features to the chart**.\r\n\r\nIt is very annoying that when I add new templates and default values into application's chart, **`--reuse-values` uses new templates, but doesn't use new values** which leads to templates errors at best and to partial upgrades at worst.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I add following snippet to some deployment's definition:\r\n```diff\r\n+           ports:\r\n+             - containerPort: {{ .Values.metrics.port }}\r\n+               name: metrics\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd values for it:\r\n```diff\r\n+ monitoring:\r\n+   port: 8001\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute `helm upgrade ./helm-chart --reuse-values --wait --atomic`\r\n\r\nThen I get following error:\r\n```\r\nError: UPGRADE FAILED: template: cool-app/templates/deployment.whatever.yaml:19:39: executing \"cool-app/templates/deployment.whatever.yaml\" at <.Values.metrics.port>: nil pointer evaluating interface {}.port\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile expected result is to perform upgrade using new default values.\r\n\r\nAt the same time all testing commands like `helm template` and `helm lint` works perfectly and uses values from local `values.yaml`.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/630291013/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Envek","id":264400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/264400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek","html_url":"https://github.com/Envek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Envek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/630414205","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8085#issuecomment-630414205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8085","id":630414205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMDQxNDIwNQ==","user":{"login":"zaro","id":135646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro","html_url":"https://github.com/zaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-18T20:20:20Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T20:20:20Z","body":"@Envek very well put.

mentioned in https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/3957#issuecomment-384685681, an alternative way to accomplish this today without needing to introduce a new feature to Helm would be\r\n\r\n`helm get values foo > values.yaml && helm upgrade foo ./foochart -f values --set ...`\r\n\r\nI could see future use cases where users may want to tweak the values from `helm get values` (e.g. coercing some values to strings and some values to integers to fix an issue from a previous release).
