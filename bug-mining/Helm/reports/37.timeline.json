Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloud Provider/Platform (AKS, GKE, Minikube etc.): KinD (but applicable to all)\r\n\r\nThis bug was observed when running `helm test` on a release with two test resources:\r\n1) Pod\r\n2) ConfigMap which the Pod depends on\r\n\r\nThe test would only create the Pod which in turn would fail due to the missing ConfigMap. `helm get hooks` on the release shows both the Pod and the ConfigMap.\r\n\r\nThe [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) debugger helped identify [this line in *Configuration.execHook()](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/efe2638f87b597403f34009e1029a6f0b44db8f2/pkg/action/hooks.go#L42):\r\n```golang\r\n// hooke are pre-ordered by kind, so keep order stable\r\nsort.Stable(hookByWeight(executingHooks))\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich in turn calls [hookByWeight.Less()](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/efe2638f87b597403f34009e1029a6f0b44db8f2/pkg/action/hooks.go#L115-L120):\r\n```golang\r\nfunc (x hookByWeight) Less(i, j int) bool {\r\n\tif x[i].Weight == x[j].Weight {\r\n\t\treturn x[i].Name < x[j].Name\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn x[i].Weight < x[j].Weight\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like #7416 helpfully pre-sorts the hooks based on resource precedence. However the sort function compares and swaps the two different `Kind`s of resources in the `executingHooks` array based on their `Name` since the Pod and the ConfigMap have the same `Weight`. The `Name` compare and swap should probably only happen if the resources have the same `Weight` *and `Kind`*.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/10006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/10006/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
