fixes unexpected changes in APIVersion1 (Helm v2) Charts when they are operated on by Helm v3 using `package` or `dependency update`.\r\n\r\nThe fixes:\r\n- `requirements.yaml` was being unconditionally merged into `Chart.yaml`, which produced packages which failed `helm lint`.\r\n- `requirements.lock` was being converted into `Chart.lock` by `helm dep up` on an APIVersion1 chart.\r\n- The code that loads `requirements.lock` and `requirements.yaml` in APIVersion1 charts for backwards compatibility, was incorrectly excluding those files from `helm package` and the `Files` collection in templates. As well as `Files` behaviour changing, this also broke sub-chart aliases for Helm v2 as those are stored in `requirements.yaml`.\r\n\r\nHelm v3 incorrectly reads aliases from `Chart.yaml`'s `dependencies` map in APIVersion1 charts, but I didn't change that, as `helm lint` warns you that this is an unexpected combination already, and it's *as well as* `requirements.yaml` so doesn't break anything.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the third commit (ae74c91) are possibly not go-idiomatic, and I specifically welcome feedback or suggested improvements.\r\n\r\nFixes: #6974
