PR extends the Helm templating engine and action configuration to allow users to inject custom template functions when using Helm as a library. It adds a new field to both the action configuration and the engine structures so that custom functions can be provided via an action config and merged with Helm’s default function set.\r\n\r\nHow to Use:\r\n\r\nUsers can configure their custom template functions in the action configuration as shown below:\r\n```\r\nconf := &action.Configuration{\r\n\tCapabilities: chartutil.DefaultCapabilities,\r\n\tCustomTemplateFuncs: template.FuncMap{\r\n\t\t\"exclaim\": func(input string) string {\r\n\t\t\treturn input + \"!!!\"\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this configuration, the Helm templating engine will have access to the custom exclaim function during rendering.\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nThe problem is described in the issue.\r\n\r\nCloses #30733\r\n\r\nThere is an old [PR](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/12135) about this.\r\nAnd an [old issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12138)\r\n\r\nIt can also help to solve [this](https://github.com/helm/community/issues/340)\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains user facing changes (the `docs needed` label should be applied if so)\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [x] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/30734/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/30734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17197073647,"node_id":"LE_lADOApspmc6xrJLOzwAAAAQBBoTv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/17197073647","actor":{"login":"yxxhero","id":11087727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg3NzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11087727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero","html_url":"https://github.com/yxxhero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxxhero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-09T23:11:01Z","label":{"name":"feature","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17244766443,"node_id":"REFE_lADOApspmc6xrJLOzwAAAAQD3kDr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/17244766443","actor":{"login":"ipaqsa","id":81509933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTA5OTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81509933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa","html_url":"https://github.com/ipaqsa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ipaqsa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7e0f626ce965799495d4c1f6431ac28d12545e3f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ipaqsa/helm/commits/7e0f626ce965799495d4c1f6431ac28d12545e3f","created_at":"2025-04-14T08:55:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/2802873583","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/30733#issuecomment-2802873583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/30733","id":2802873583,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApspmc6nEHTv","user":{"login":"joejulian","id":952828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/952828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian","html_url":"https://github.com/joejulian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joejulian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-14T20:11:22Z","updated_at":"2025-04-14T20:11:22Z","body":"I'd

In common case you are right, but this feature becomes especially useful when Helm is primarily used as render/monitor resources engine, for instance when it handles not just a standard chart but something custom. In our case we use Helm as a part of our project/template manager, which operates in realtime within the cluster(we are building k8s based platform). We have a custom resource \"Template\" that allows users to define a set of resources along with their settings. The template is then deployed by creating a “Project” resource(this is already not compatible with the rest of the industry). \nAnd we want to extend template`s capabilities by adding specific custom functions, now we handle it via \"helmlib\", a set of helpers in \"template\" language, but its not convenient and too limited. \n\nIf you’d like, I can provide more detailed use cases with concrete examples, and I think developers who will use this feature will take responsibility for compatibility.\n\nMaybe it was the same request [here](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12138)\n\nAnd I think this may help [here](https://github.com/helm/community/issues/340) and
