use the \"lookup\" function, which is resulting in problems with my yaml formatting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ helm install --namespace myapp api ./charts/deploy/\r\nError: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: error validating \"\": error validating data: ValidationError(Secret.metadata): unknown field \"type\" in io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe template file from which I believe the error is coming from looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\napiVersion: v1\r\ndata:\r\n  auth: {{ (lookup \"v1\" \"Secret\" \"app2\" \"api-k8s-htpasswd\").data.auth }}\r\nkind: Secret\r\nmetadata:\r\n  labels:\r\n    k8s-app: myap-api\r\n  name: htpasswd-secret\r\ntype: Opaque\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, the lookup function was disabled when you run `helm template`, as trying to process this chart results in a nil pointer error:\r\n```\r\nError: template: deploy/templates/htpasswd-secret.yaml:4:56: executing \"deploy/templates/htpasswd-secret.yaml\" at <\"api-k8s-htpasswd\">: nil pointer evaluating interface {}.auth\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to have a discussion as to why I can't use `helm template` to debug my chart, as that, in my opinion, should be the primary purpose of having a `template` command.","closed_by":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8137/reactions","total_count":58,"+1":58,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8137/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
