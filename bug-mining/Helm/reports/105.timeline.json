Summary\r\n\r\nhelm3 has a new template function called lookup. \r\nThe lookup function can be used to look up resources in a running cluster and get metadata from objects on render time. \r\nthis feature was introduced on helm3 release and was working with helm template command, the problem was this is a vulnerability in terms of helm template shouldn't interact with the cluster unless specified the --validate flag. \r\n\r\nin the latest helm3 version they fixed that vulnerability and now helm template wouldn't render this function, but it should render when using --validate flag. \r\n\r\nthis feature currently doesn't work with helm template --validate as it should be, but it should be fixed soon and there is also an open issue about it.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nget metadata from objects like ConfigMaps so I can decide on which cluster im on, and write logic in helm template to use it instead of writing it in each values.yaml file for each cluster( i have 40 k8s clusters I manage, and 90% of the time the only thing I change between the clusters is the cluster name I'm deploying to.)\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nArgoCD uses helm template command before applying with kubectl to the cluster. \r\nif we could have the option to add --validate to helm template command it could solve the problem and support the lookup function once this issue is solved by helm.
