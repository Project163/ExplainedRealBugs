we have two different cases with the same behavior from helm side. \r\nBoth `2.15.1` and `3 beta` versions are affected.__\r\n\r\nAs @technosophos mentioned helm uses discovery API functionality and fails if any of API response fails https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/f1dc84773f9a34fe59a504fdb32428ce1d56a2e8/pkg/action/action.go#L105-L118\r\n\r\n1. cert-manager's `admission.certmanager.k8s.io/v1beta1` is a good example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl get apiservice | grep certmanager\r\nv1beta1.admission.certmanager.k8s.io   service/cert-manager-webhook   False (ServiceNotFound)   111d\r\n```\r\nand for this case you can easily fix it by `kubectl delete apiservice v1beta1.admission.certmanager.k8s.io`\r\nas @brendandburns described.\r\n\r\n1. Another case of failure when helm cannot retrieve the response from any of api service\r\ne.g. \"metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1: the server is currently unable to handle the request\"  and it happens from case to case\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's alive and running but was down accidentally during the helm's request.\r\n```\r\n⇒  k get apiservice | grep metrics\r\nv1beta1.metrics.k8s.io                 kube-system/metrics-server     True        1y\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm sure that helm must be more robust for such type of issues, \r\n1) maybe it's a good idea to convert the error to warning (I don't know how the info from api service uses during the template rendering)\r\n2) implement retries for such type of requests","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/547279671/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hayorov","id":991591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTU5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/991591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov","html_url":"https://github.com/hayorov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hayorov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2750999044,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1MDk5OTA0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/2750999044","actor":{"login":"brendandburns","id":5751682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTE2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5751682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns","html_url":"https://github.com/brendandburns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-29T06:42:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2750999045,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTA5OTkwNDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/2750999045","actor":{"login":"brendandburns","id":5751682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTE2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5751682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns","html_url":"https://github.com/brendandburns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendandburns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-29T06:42:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/547481565","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6361#issuecomment-547481565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/6361","id":547481565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzQ4MTU2NQ==","user":{"login":"dmitry-irtegov","id":32154635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTU0NjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32154635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov","html_url":"https://github.com/dmitry-irtegov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitry-irtegov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_typ
