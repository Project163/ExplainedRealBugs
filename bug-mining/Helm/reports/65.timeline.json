I realized that the code has `filepath` function calls and so I can't write any failing test. I could write it if I run the tests in a windows environment where the `filepath` function works differently with `\\` as path separator. So, we need to add support to run tests in windows. Do you think we could do it as part of this PR? I think it would be better that way. Or else the fix code is straight forward, but test would give more confidence since I can't keep running commands and testing in windows in a VM. 😅

One more CI pipeline - Another thing to maintain? And I struggled to run `make` in my Windows VM. I used cygwin and tried stuff to make `make` run 🙈 .
