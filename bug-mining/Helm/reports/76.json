Setting the backoff to 0 as well as ` restartPolicy: Never` ensures that a job is only run once.\r\n\r\n[The following check](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/pkg/kube/wait.go#L193) validates failed runs are greater than or equal to 0. This condition will always return true when a job with `backOffLimit: 0` completes, because the `job.Status.Failed` will have a zero value (the field will not exist on job status).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jdolitsky","id":393494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzQ5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/393494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky","html_url":"https://github.com/jdolitsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdolitsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/9312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/9312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
