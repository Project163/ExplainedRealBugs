commit adds the `skipHooks` option to the helm chart support in order\nto  expose the --no-hooks flag introduced to Helm in [1].\n\nUsing Kustomize to inflate a Helm chart would in some situations result in\ndifferent results than using `helm install`. This is because `helm\ntemplate`, by default, will render chart tests in the `templates/test`\ndirectory, which can lead to undesired resources in the output.\n\nSee [2] for additional discussion.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6444\n[2]: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6443\n\nSigned-off-by: Lars Kellogg-Stedman
