partition` (equals 0)\r\n\r\nand `int(sts.Status.UpdatedReplicas) != expectedReplicas` since `UpdatedReplicas` is 3.\r\n\r\nGetting a StatefulSet in this state can happen when updating the partition attribute after a rolling update:\r\n\r\n* Start with a STS partition: 3\r\n* Deploy a change.\r\n* Rolling update by setting partition 0.\r\n* Set partition back to 3.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this would catch other cases, but it seems like taking the revisions into account would work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexpectedReplicas := replicas\r\nif (sts.Status.UpdateRevision != sts.Status.CurrentRevision) {\r\n   expectedReplicas -= partition\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you need help or think you have found a bug, please help us with your issue by entering the following information (otherwise you can delete this text): -->\r\n\r\nOutput of `helm version`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nversion.BuildInfo{Version:\"v3.2.4\", GitCommit:\"0ad800ef43d3b826f31a5ad8dfbb4fe05d143688\", GitTreeState:\"dirty\", GoVersion:\"go1.14.3\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of `kubectl version`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClient Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"14\", GitVersion:\"v1.14.10\", GitCommit:\"575467a0eaf3ca1f20eb86215b3bde40a5ae617a\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2019-12-11T12:41:00Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.12.12\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"darwin/amd64\"}\r\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"14\", GitVersion:\"v1.14.10\", GitCommit:\"575467a0eaf3ca1f20eb86215b3bde40a5ae617a\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2019-12-11T12:32:32Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.12.12\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloud Provider/Platform (AKS, GKE, Minikube etc.): N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
