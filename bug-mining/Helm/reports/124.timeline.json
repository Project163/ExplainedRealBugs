(you get the idea) _definitions.json  Connection reset by peer.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHelm tries to check something on the internet and is not allowed.\r\nI could modify the chart and download these definitions to the project but is there a way to point to a local json file in values.schema.json?\r\n\r\nOr is there a simpler approach?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\n<!-- A minimal example that exhibits the behavior -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dagit UI/UX Issue Screenshots\r\n<!-- (Optional) -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Info about Your Environment\r\n<!-- (Optional) -->\r\nI am able to build dockerfiles, use those, and install python packages in this environment.\r\nKubernetes 1.21.5\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Message from the maintainers:\r\nImpacted by this bug?

For an overview of json schema validation for helm values see [here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#schema-files).\r\nGarden adds custom values to a chart deployed with Garden to add some metadata to the helm release. This is an example of a values file that Garden produces:\r\n\r\n```\r\nservice:\r\n  type: LoadBalancer\r\n  ports:\r\n    - name: https\r\n      port: 443\r\n      protocol: TCP\r\n      targetPort: 443\r\n.garden:\r\n  moduleName: istio-gateway\r\n  projectName: istio-example\r\n  version: v-5f013b4127\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `additionalProperties: false` is set in the values.schema.json of a chart the deploy will fail with following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: INSTALLATION FAILED: values don't meet the specifications of the schema(s) in the following chart(s):\r\ngateway:\r\n- (root): Additional property .garden is not allowed\r\n```\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nGarden deploys the helm chart.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible example\r\n\r\nDeploy the istio gateway Helm Chart with Garden e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkind: Deploy\r\nname: istio-gateway\r\ndescription: Install istio gateway helm chart\r\ntype: helm\r\nspec:\r\n  chart:\r\n    name: gateway\r\n    version: 1.17.1\r\n    repo: https://istio-release.storage.googleapis.com/charts\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nIf you maintain the chart, consider setting `additionalProperties: true` in the validation schema. If it is a public chart the only way to install it is to download it and store it locally and set `additionalProperties: true`.\r\nThere is an open issue in Helm like https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/10398 to override  the validation client-side.\r\n\r\n### Suggested solution(s)\r\n\r\nStore the Garden related metadata in a configmap or secret in the same namespace similar to test results instead of Helm values.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nIf you run into this error please give the issue a thumbsup, currently we only saw this with the istio chart.\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n\r\n<!-- PLEASE FILL THIS OUT -->\r\n* **OS:** <!-- which macOS, linux distro, Windows, etc. -->\r\n* **How I'm running Kubernetes:** <!-- e.g. minikube, GKE, EKS, other --> \r\n\r\n<!-- Please run and copy and paste the results  -->\r\n`garden version`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/garden-io/garden/issues/3962/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/garden-io/garden/issues/3962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/1598852055","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/10398#issuecomment-1598852055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/10398","id":1598852055,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApspmc5fTIvX","user":{"login":"zswanson","id":1272954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzI5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1272954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson","html_url":"https://github.com/zswanson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zswanson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-20T13:59:15Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T13:59:15Z","body":"Can
