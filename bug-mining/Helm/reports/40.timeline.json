The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP. A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.*\r\n\r\nFor that reason, when `externalIPs` is used and `--wait` flag is set, helm should not wait for `.Status.LoadBalancer.Ingress` to be different from `nil`\r\n\r\n**Possible solution**\r\n\r\nChanging the condition of [`serviceReady` function](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/5ec70ab27fbf54ab529984db154953cbf68da78f/pkg/kube/wait.go#L184) with something similar to the following code should be enough:\r\n```go\r\n// Make sure the service is not explicitly set to \"None\" before checking the IP\r\nif s.Spec.ClusterIP != corev1.ClusterIPNone && s.Spec.ClusterIP == \"\" {\r\n\treturn false\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This checks if the
