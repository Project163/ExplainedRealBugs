For example, this template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{- $foo := \"\" -}}\r\n{{required \"foo is required\" $foo}}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncreates the following error:\r\n```\r\ntemplate: requiredTest:3:2: executing \"requiredTest\" at <required \"foo is required\" $foo>: error calling required: foo is required\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat message has a ton of redundancy, but unfortunately no way to parse out the important bits without possibly treading on a user's toes (e.g. parsing on colons).\r\n\r\nI've submitted [a Pull Request](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6066) which addresses this by inserting arbitrary delimiters around the user's warning message, then parsing out the message if an error occurs. The PR includes a unit test that addresses this specific issue.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/514292199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ian-howell","id":10422579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDIyNTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10422579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell","html_url":"https://github.com/ian-howell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ian-howell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/516161513","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6044#issuecomment-516161513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/6044","id":516161513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjE2MTUxMw==","user":{"login":"thomastaylor312","id":4294228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4294228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312","html_url":"https://github.com/thomastaylor312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T21:03:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T21:03:36Z","body":"Resolved
