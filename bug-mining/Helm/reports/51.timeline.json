had been exposing XDG based variables to end users. This lead\r\nto confusion. For example, if a user wanted to change the cache\r\nlocation Helm used should they change the XDG variable? Since this\r\nwould be like changing the HOME environment variable the answer\r\nis no.\r\n\r\nThis change adds HELM_*_HOME environment variables to be used\r\nin addition to XDG ones of the same name. Helm will now look\r\nfor the Helm specific variable. If not set, Helm will fall\r\nback to XDG locations. If those are not set a default location\r\nwill be used. This keeps XDG in use as a default when present,\r\nprovides users with the ability to set the location, and removes\r\nXDG from being exposed to end users to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nCloses #7919\r\n\r\n@marckhouzam Would this solve for #6890, too?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3280883483,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyODA4ODM0ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3280883483","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2334195a01a6e47d597940890890a1369f8bcba4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mattfarina/helm/commits/2334195a01a6e47d597940890890a1369f8bcba4","created_at":"2020-04-28T15:29:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3306101242,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzMwNjEwMTI0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3306101242","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-05T21:33:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3832285360,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4MzIyODUzNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3832285360","actor":{"login":"hunsche","id":29682721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjgyNzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29682721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche","html_url":"https://github.com/hunsche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8d2333f09c147f7f3f33ed4f94086cecfe68be1f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hunsche/helm/commits/8d2333f09c147f7f3f33ed4f94086cecfe68be1f","created_at":"2020-10-02T04:08:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
