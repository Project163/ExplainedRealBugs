 Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nThis PR introduces fuzzing to Helm by adding the first fuzzer to the project. The fuzzer gets decent coverage and has been used to find [this crash](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8116). \r\n\r\nThe fuzzer can be run locally, and I suggest implementing continuous fuzzing into Helm to keep looking for bugs and keep the fuzzer running. Keeping the fuzzers running for an extended period of time has been proven to find bugs. As an example, [this one](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20170126.txt) took 3 cpu years of fuzzing to find.\r\n\r\nI managed to setup the fuzzer on oss-fuzz's infrastructure, and I will be happy to integrate Helm into their platform. This will allow Google to run the fuzzer and all future fuzzers, continuously, and if a bug is found, the maintainers on the email list receive a detailed bug report.\r\noss-fuzz is a free service with an implied expectation that the bugs are fixed, so that the resources spent on fuzzing Helm are put to good use.\r\n\r\nAll I need to integrate Helm into oss-fuzz are the emails addresses that should receive the bug reports.\r\n\r\nI will be happy to progressively work more on fuzzing Helm to increase the coverage and improve the effectiveness of the fuzzers.\r\n\r\n**Special notes for the reviewer**:\r\nThis PR reopens https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8114 which was rejected due to lack of information.\r\nThis PR does not change any functionality or update any code in Helm.\r\nThis PR does not provide any documentation.\r\nThis PR does not contain unit tests.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Adam Korczynski adam@adalogics.com","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8124/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3832285376,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4MzIyODUzNzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3832285376","actor":{"login":"hunsche","id":29682721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjgyNzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29682721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche","html_url":"https://github.com/hunsche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunsche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c7067d3d72047c5df5401a33f5241557494ddfab","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hunsche/helm/commits/c7067d3d72047c5df5401a33f5241557494ddfab","created_at":"2020-10-02T04:08:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
