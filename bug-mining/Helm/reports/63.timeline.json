two `helm upgrade`s are executed at the exact same time, then one of\r\nthe invocations will fail with \"already exists\".\r\n\r\nIf one `helm upgrade` is executed and a second one is started while the\r\nfirst is in `pending-upgrade`, then the second invocation will create a\r\nnew release. Effectively, two helm invocations will simultaneously\r\nchange the state of Kubernetes resources -- which is scary -- then two\r\nreleases will be in `deployed` state -- which can cause other issues.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the corrupted storage problem, by introducting a poor\r\nperson's lock. If the last release is in a pending state, then helm will\r\nabort. If the last release is in a pending state, due to a previously\r\nkilled helm, then the user is expected to do `helm rollback`.\r\n\r\nCloses #7274\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Cristian Klein <cristian.klein@elastisys.com>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7322/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3541278563,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1NDEyNzg1NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3541278563","actor":{"login":"cristiklein","id":1660833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjA4MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1660833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein","html_url":"https://github.com/cristiklein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristiklein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9a4f4ec64b8092d2ba3d7493001837df4737e36c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cristiklein/helm/commits/9a4f4ec64b8092d2ba3d7493001837df4737e36c","created_at":"2020-07-13T20:58:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3541434431,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzU0MTQzNDQzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3541434431","actor":{"login":"bacongobbler","id":1360539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/bacongobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-13T21:51:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3825537790,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4MjU1Mzc3OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3825537790","actor":{"login":"vladfr","id":212615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjYxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr","html_url":"https://github.com/vladfr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"440cc7720fadf743f1ab24d4f13a3da19d14db35","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vladfr/helm/commits/440cc7720fadf743f1ab24d4f13a3da19d14db35","created_at":"2020-09-30T16:59:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
