That is, `helm template` misses hook resources and `helm template --no-hooks true/false` doesn't change the behavior.\r\n\r\nContext: https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff/pull/151\r\n\r\nTo be extra clear, `helm template` in helm 2 had no `--no-hooks` and hard-coded to output hook-related k8s manifests. In helm 3, we have `--no-hooks` so to (1)to make it backward-compatible I'd like to `helm template` to include hooks in the output and (2)to make it consistent with other helm 3 commands like `install` and `upgrade`, I'd like `helm template --no-hooks` to turn output to include no hooks.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bacongobbler","id":1360539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/bacongobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/6443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/6443/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
