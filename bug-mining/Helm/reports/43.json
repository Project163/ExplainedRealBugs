But, there are two problems with it:\r\n\r\n1. It is not available for download to verify against.\r\n2. Does not handle multiple releases. The file is named `shasums.txt` for 3.1.0. When 3.1.1 comes out the file name for that one is also `shasums.txt`.\r\n\r\nThere there is the usability issue. If someone does have the `shasums.txt` file and tries to use it after downloading a single file they get something like...\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ shasum -a 256 -c shasums.txt\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-darwin-amd64.tar.gz: OK\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-386.tar.gz:\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-386.tar.gz: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-arm.tar.gz: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-arm.tar.gz: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-arm64.tar.gz: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-arm64.tar.gz: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-ppc64le.tar.gz: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-ppc64le.tar.gz: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-s390x.tar.gz: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-s390x.tar.gz: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-windows-amd64.tar.gz: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-windows-amd64.tar.gz: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-darwin-amd64.zip: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-darwin-amd64.zip: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-386.zip: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-386.zip: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-amd64.zip: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-amd64.zip: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-arm.zip: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-arm.zip: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-arm64.zip: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-arm64.zip: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-ppc64le.zip: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-ppc64le.zip: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-s390x.zip: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-linux-s390x.zip: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: helm-3.1.0-rc.1-windows-amd64.zip: No such file or directory\r\nhelm-3.1.0-rc.1-windows-amd64.zip: FAILED open or read\r\nshasum: WARNING: 15 listed files could not be read\r\n\r\n$ echo $?\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of all the missing files the exit code IS NOT 0.\r\n\r\nWe should fix this prior to releasing 3.1.0.\r\n\r\nI would suggest a 2 step process:\r\n\r\n1. We break the `shasums.txt` file into one file for each download. Name them after the file + `.sha256sum` extension. When downloading a file they only need to download the corresponding checksum file and can use it with `shasum` out of the box. Being named after the file it will contain the version. This solves for 2 of the 3 problems.\r\n2. Upload the file to get.helm.sh. The fetch-dist and signing work should also handle this new file. This will solve the other problem.\r\n\r\nHow does this plan sound?","closed_by":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7567/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
