 Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nThe PR closes #10566 issue when flag `--logs` is used together with `--filter`.\r\nCurrently `test` command ignores any filters and because of that it fails when fetching logs from excluded pods.\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\nIt is my first PR so let me know if I did something wrong.

hope this PR gets merged soon. This seems like a very basic feature that is missing. The logs output should simply contain the logs from the test pods that were deployed with the command that was run.\r\n\r\nBecause this doesn't work, not only do we get the error about logs not found, but also logs from actual tests that were run are not displayed. This makes the --logs flag completely unusable with --filter which is crucial for a large test suite.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/1429432903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Illidanek","id":3578268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzgyNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3578268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek","html_url":"https://github.com/Illidanek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Illidanek","id":3578268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzgyNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3578268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek","html_url":"https://github.com/Illidanek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Illidanek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T10:02:40Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T10:02:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/11819","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/11819/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/11819/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/11819/events","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/11819","id":1583859385,"node_id":"I_kwDOApspmc5eZ8a5","number":11819,"title":"Helm
