It only seems fair to support `.tar.gz` which is the same thing but just a different / extended extension name. I understand `helm package` gives only a `.tgz` as an output. I just felt that they both are the same thing technically, but why does it not work for `.tar.gz`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ helm create test-dummy-chart\r\nCreating test-dummy-chart\r\n\r\n$ helm3 package test-dummy-chart/\r\nSuccessfully packaged chart and saved it to: /Users/karuppiahoss/go/src/helm.sh/helm/test-dummy-chart-0.1.0.tgz\r\n\r\n$ helm3 lint test-dummy-chart-0.1.0.tgz\r\n==> Linting test-dummy-chart-0.1.0.tgz\r\n[INFO] Chart.yaml: icon is recommended\r\n\r\n1 chart(s) linted, 0 chart(s) failed\r\n\r\n$ mv test-dummy-chart-0.1.0.tgz test-dummy-chart-0.1.0.tar.gz\r\n\r\n$ helm3 lint test-dummy-chart-0.1.0.tar.gz\r\n==> Linting test-dummy-chart-0.1.0.tar.gz\r\nError no chart found for linting (missing Chart.yaml)\r\n\r\nError: 1 chart(s) linted, 1 chart(s) failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust felt it could work for `.tar.gz` too.
