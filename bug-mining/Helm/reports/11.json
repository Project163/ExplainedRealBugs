I'm just writing it up here. Can do a proposal to community if this needs to move forward. Not entirely sure what is feasible yet.\r\n\r\n**The idea:**\r\n\r\nHave a `crd` directory alongside the `templates` directory. Helm would then check for missing CRDs and attempt to install them. If it cannot install them and they are missing it would stop, explain why it can't install them (e.g., permissions), and provide some details (e.g., someone with permissions needs to install the CRDs).\r\n\r\nThis is because there is common wrapper logic needed around CRDs for each of them that is about the same for this. First, check if it's installed and if it's not then have it there with the crd install hook.\r\n\r\nOne unknown is handing changes in the CRD content at the same `apiVersion`. This happens in practice and has many potential problems. Can we detect a change and throw an error to require human intervention?\r\n\r\nOnce this is in place the Helm dependency system can be used to handle CRDs that are dependent upon one another. Each can be in their own chart with their own controllers.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/5871/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/5871/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
