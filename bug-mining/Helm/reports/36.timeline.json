of modifying the global one?\r\n\r\nOutput of `helm version`:v3.8.1\r\nOutput of `kubectl version`: v1.21.3\r\nCloud Provider/Platform: Minikube v1.25.2\r\nRelated to PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6566\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\n\r\nThere are two workarounds:\r\n* Create the Helm `action.Configuration` and initialize it before starting the controller-runtime manager\r\n* Create a global dummy client and assign it to a blank identifier so that the `scheme.Scheme` object modification happens before any other code.
