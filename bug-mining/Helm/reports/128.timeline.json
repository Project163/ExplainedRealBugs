I can confirm that it returns an exit code of 0 regardless if errors updating repos.\r\n\r\nThis is because the code in https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/cmd/helm/repo_update.go#L117, just outputs any error messages and does not return an error in the the cobra command. Therefore, cobra will return 0 always.\r\n\r\nI am unsure if this is as expected or not.

discussion.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/896542584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hickeyma","id":14892004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyMDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14892004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma","html_url":"https://github.com/hickeyma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5139786488,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTEzOTc4NjQ4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/5139786488","actor":{"login":"knurl","id":8318998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTg5OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8318998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl","html_url":"https://github.com/knurl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T06:37:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5139786491,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxMzk3ODY0OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/5139786491","actor":{"login":"knurl","id":8318998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTg5OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8318998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl","html_url":"https://github.com/knurl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knurl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T06:37:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5139806029,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUxMzk4MDYwMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/5139806029","actor":{"login":"hickeyma","id":14892004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyMDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14892004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma","html_url":"https://github.com/hickeyma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T06:42:11Z","label":{"name":"question/support","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/897738411","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/10016#issuecomment-897738411","issue_url":"https

discussed in the call, the best place to move this proposal forward would be to write a HIP.\r\n\r\nFor example, we need to re-define what we mean by \"failure\" - what if you have 18 repositories in your list and call help repo update. 17 succeed and one doesn't. Is that a successful update or not? Up until now that was considered a success with the caveat that a warning message was displayed on standard error.

It needs to be queued for Helm 4. \r\n- The issue can be viewed as a bug or working as expected depending on the standpoint. We did agree that the behaviour needs to be re-examined especially in light of how Helm has evolved, and the [deprecation of the Helm chart repository](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-2-becomes-unsupported/) which now means a lot more repositories being accessed.  The suggestion at the meeting was about [Proposing an Idea](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#proposing-an-idea) around handling repositories and including how other package managers like `apt` work.\r\n- @mattfarina showed interest in drafting a [HIP](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/main/hips/hip-0001.md) and @scottrigby also mentioned about being involved\r\n\r\nI am going to set this as a proposal and target it for Helm 4. Once the HIP is drafted, you can add your feedback there.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/898290567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hickeyma","id":14892004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyMDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14892004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma","html_url":"https://github.com/hickeyma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5154536493,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE1NDUzNjQ5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/5154536493","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-13T08:42:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5154536497,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNTQ1MzY0OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/5154536497","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-13T08:42:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5154536501,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE1NDUzNjUwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/5154536501","actor":{"login":"scottrigby","id":407675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzY3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/407675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby","html_url":"https://github.com/scottrigby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-13T08:42:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5154536506,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNTQ1MzY1MDY=","url":"https://api.github.co

fair, I agree that we don’t want to break expected behaviour. We could pass a command line switch to augment the behaviour (possibly waiting for Helm 4), so that we would get a success code only if the update of all repos were successful. If the switch isn’t passed, then there is no change to existing behaviour, and any failures are not transmitted to the return code.\n\nI’m not a huge fan of the idea of adding new command line options to affect return codes, but there is form there in tools like Terraform. However, right now I’m having to parse the output of the helm command to see if it failed, which also strikes me as really ugly, and is definitely extremely brittle and likely to break in the future.\n\nBest, Rob\n--\nRob Anderson\n***@***.***\n\n> On 13 Aug 2021, at 10:42, Martin Hickey ***@***.***> wrote:\n> \n> \n> @knurl <https://github.com/knurl> As @bacongobbler <https://github.com/bacongobbler> mentioned, this issue was discussed at the weekly call yesterday.\n> \n> Just clarifying a few things:\n> \n> The behaviour cannot be changed in Helm 3 as it would break backward compatibility (rightly or wrongly users expect it to work in a certain way).
