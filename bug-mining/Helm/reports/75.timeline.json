I'm reminded that numerous people are still running production systems older than 1.16. I know people using 1.13. This is going to mess with things like `NetworkPolicy` which have a much smaller deprecation window. Some people will have environments that don't have the new version yet. I wonder about the deprecation policy being a warning for some and an error for others. To add more nuance.\r\n\r\nThanks @mattfarina. I see where you're coming from, and I fully understand this point of view. If I may play devil's advocate for a moment here...\r\n\r\nWe have documented and discussed that a given version of Helm has a version support policy of N-3 Kubernetes versions, where N is the client version that Helm was compiled against. https://helm.sh/docs/topics/version_skew/\r\n\r\nAccording to that document, Helm 3.0 was compiled against Kubernetes 1.16, so Helm 3.0 supports Kubernetes versions 1.13-1.16. Shouldn't users running Kubernetes 1.13 use Helm 3.0, and upgrade their Kubernetes clusters when upgrading to a newer version of Helm?\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, there's a balance that we need to strike here: we need to provide a good experience for users running Helm against a supported version of Kubernetes, so that they \"fall into a pit of success\". Helm 3.3 supports Kubernetes 1.18-1.15, and those versions of Kubernetes (asides 1.15, I believe) do not allow users to install `apps/v1beta1` Deployments, so an error seems appropriate for those users. If there are cases (like what @kofan mentioned in https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8596#issuecomment-675305111) where an error should NOT be reported, then perhaps we should revisit that particular case, but in general I believe it is right for Helm to report linting errors for kubernetes APIs that have been deprecated and are no longer supported.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear your thoughts as well. I know there is a bit of a balancing game here.\r\n\r\nAs others have mentioned, reducing the severity to a warning works around this (and users can use `--strict` to promote warnings to errors), but

[Helm 3.0 has a security vulnerability in it](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-qq3j-xp49-j73f). This is just one example. I can imagine more coming up. This would complicate me recommending someone use an older version of Helm for their older cluster. Especially if the newer version could work (client-go does work).\r\n\r\nPart of this is also about being practical. There are people using Kubernetes 1.13 in production. I know of multiple cases. This is no longer supported by the community. Unless it's been patched, it has known issues. Yet, it is in use. So, we need to decide how easy we want to make it for people to use Helm with it.

agree that there is a practicality element to all of this, and I have heard the same sentiment about Kubernetes' support policy not matching up with the community's usage of the Kubernetes project. On the flip-side of this argument, this data is all anecdotal, and we do not have concrete evidence to suggest otherwise. What I'm wondering is how do we - as core maintainers - make informed decisions about what Kubernetes versions we need to support, and when we can drop support for these older versions, or do we keep supporting Kubernetes 1.13 users in perpetuity? Is there a metric out there that tells us what versions of Kubernetes are used with Helm?\r\n\r\nPerhaps that's a really solid argument to bring back the topic of anonymized metrics for Helm as was discussed at the first Helm Summit.\r\n\r\n> Yet, there is a security element to it. [Helm 3.0 has a security vulnerability in it](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-qq3j-xp49-j73f).\r\n\r\nTo be totally fair, this same argument could be flipped around with regards to Kubernetes as well. Kubernetes 1.13 is no longer considered \"supported\", and there are [several](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-security-announce/cB_JUsYEKyY) known [CVEs](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-security-announce/JAIGG5yNROs) for those versions as well. From the two CVEs linked above, those affect all versions prior to 1.16. So should we really be supporting those clusters if the Kubernetes project will not provide support?\r\n\r\n> Note, since this is already an error... don't we need to keep it an error and have a flag to make it a warning?\r\n\r\nPrior versions of `helm lint` would accept the API versions and return an exit code of zero. With the changes to Helm 3.3, these resources now trigger an error, returning a non-zero exit code. I think there's an argument to be made that this could be considered a regression, which would warrant downgrading it to a warning to fix that regression. That being said, it may be worth giving other maintainers an opportunity to weigh in here.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/676621293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bacongobbler","id":1360539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/bacongobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"bacongobbler","id":1360539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/bacongobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-19T21:07:06Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T21:07:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8621","id":682163436,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODIxNjM0MzY=","number":8621,"title":"Linting

idea behind making these lint checks of ERROR severity is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Deprecated/Removed APIs: Helm will no longer be able to manage a release if it contains a Kubernetes resource with an API which is no longer supported by the Kubernetes version. This can happen by just upgrading Kubernetes to a certain version with existing releases. See [Deprecated Kubernetes APIs doc](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/kubernetes_apis/) for more details\r\n- Metadata names: Following the `kubectl` naming rules is good practice\r\n\r\nMy thought on this is that the lint severity should mirror Helm's opinionated view. This view is continually developing from experience and best practices, helping users to avoid potential pitfalls. It then is up to the user to decide whether to heed the errors or not. The severity matches the potential of how bad the outcome can be for the user.\r\n\r\nAs @mattfarina @bacongobbler have mentioned, I am also a practical person and understand that users will be using Kubernetes in different ways and with different version which won't always align to the Helm opinion. This is why there has been  a lot of issues raised against linting and how people think it should best work. @technosophos has given a lot of feedback on the topic in other issues and also in https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8608#issuecomment-677913757 and https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8608#issuecomment-677937877.\r\n\r\nI agree then that the severity for both check should be downgraded to warning. I have added a suggestion to provide more information to the user for APIs in
