We should NEVER lock to a range, as that makes reproducible builds sketchy at best.\r\n\r\nThe issue above was one of the reasons why I argued for a long time that all repositories must have a named local repo cache. I did not like the implementation that was merged using URLs directly with no cache.\r\n\r\nSo this proposal is much closer to the way Helm was intended to work. I am okay with it, and would be even happier if these caches were not invisible. I don't see a reason to hide sources from users. (Other package managers don't do that, so I don't see why we should.)\r\n\r\nThe push-back I have heard that \"helm shouldn't write cache data to the local filesystem\" is a non-starter here. That's based on an exceedingly niche use case (CI in which no writable volumes are attached), and we should not design Helm around those cases to the detriment of the vast majority of our user population.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/658341161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"technosophos","id":89193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos","html_url":"https://github.com/technosophos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3549007703,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzU0OTAwNzcwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3549007703","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-15T15:06:10Z","label":{"name":"feature","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3549007705,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NDkwMDc3MDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3549007705","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-15T15:06:10Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"e11d21"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/658823990","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8449#issuecomment-658823990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8449","id":658823990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODgyMzk5MA==","user":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"publ

were two situations where a lockfile could end up with a version range as a version instead of a pinned version.\r\n\r\n1. When `file://` was used. This would point to the file location on the filesystem but, instead of using the version in that chart at that file location the version range would be used.\r\n2. If a repository was used that was not added with `helm repo add`. Instead of causing an error that the repository was not available the version range was used in the lockfile. This is not locking.\r\n\r\nThis change looks to correct these problems. The `file://` handling fix was fairly straight forward. In that case update gets the current version of the dependency on disk and locks to that.\r\n\r\nHandling unknown repos went through 4 different major versions. This 4th one is the one that settled on because all the changes are in the download manager which handles network issues. Other cases had added network operations to the resolver which is meant to iterate over existing versions. I chose this as the network and downloading stay in the same struct and it's methods are largely reusable within the new logic.\r\n\r\nCloses #8449 \r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [ ] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3577320313,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1NzczMjAzMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3577320313","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9cb90a8b234f98c16aef0918cba92d83061d7c97","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mattfarina/helm/commits/9cb90a8b234f98c16aef0918cba92d83061d7c97","created_at":"2020-07-22T19:53:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3581457715,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzU4MTQ1NzcxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3581457715","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-23T19:43:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3825537812,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4MjU1Mzc4MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3825537812","actor":{"login":"vladfr","id":212615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjYxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr","html_url":"https://github.com/vladfr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladfr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"74e4a51486b22fbd61b1ea4b42fdd5d9dbc2806f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vladfr/helm/commits/74e4a51486b22fbd61b1ea4b42fdd5d9dbc2806f","created_at":"2020-09-30T16:59:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
