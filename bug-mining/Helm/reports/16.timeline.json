pairing on this issue, @thomastaylor312 and I identified a bigger design issue. For `--atomic`, we just need `pkg/kube` to return the results of the install/upgrade - including what resources failed to create - then reconcile those resources.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's a similar case where we want to reconcile a failed `helm install/upgrade`. Because Helm doesn't know the resources that Helm failed to create, a `helm delete` results in deleting all resources the release was tracking (see #3319).\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if we can identify a fix that addresses both issues at the same

raises an error if we try to install with a chart some resources which already exist in our cluster.\r\nAccording to @bacongobbler in https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6031, _\"Helm does not \"adopt\" existing resources; if a resource exists before it was introduced in the chart, it's considered an error condition, hence the error message\"_.\r\nSome post suggested a workaround with Helm version 2. During the first installation, the release was in a state FAILED, but a second installation of the same chart made the release in \r\na DEPLOYED state.\r\n\r\nWith Helm3, it does not work anymore:\r\n```\r\n$ helm3 install test ./helm-test --debug\r\ninstall.go:158: [debug] Original chart version: \"\"\r\ninstall.go:175: [debug] CHART PATH: [...]\r\nclient.go:86: [debug] creating 3 resource(s)\r\nError: services \"service\" already exists\r\nhelm.go:81: [debug] services \"service\" already exists\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ helm3 install test ./helm-test --replace --debug \r\ninstall.go:158: [debug] Original chart version: \"\"\r\ninstall.go:175: [debug] CHART PATH: [...]\r\nclient.go:86: [debug] creating 3 resource(s)\r\nError: services \"service\" already exists\r\nhelm.go:81: [debug] services \"service\" already exists\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ helm3 ls\r\nNAME\tNAMESPACE\tREVISION\tUPDATED                                \tSTATUS\tCHART          \r\ntest\tdefault  \t1       \t2019-10-02 17:29:13.735401532 -0400 EDT\tfailed\thelm-test-0.1.0\r\ntest\tdefault  \t2       \t2019-10-02 17:31:05.690696039 -0400 EDT\tfailed\thelm-test-0.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this behavior is probably intended, but in this case, how can I merge the k8s resources of an active cluster to a Helm chart? It is suggested to delete the objects and recreate them with Helm, but it is not a realistic option with a running cluster. What is your advice to \"adopt\" running resources?\r\n\r\nThanks for your support,\r\nJB\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ helm3 version\r\nversion.BuildInfo{Version:\"v3.0.0-beta.3\", GitCommit:\"5cb923eecbe80d1ad76399aee234717c11931d9a\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", GoVersion:\"go1.12.9\"}\r\n$ kubectl version\r\nClient Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"12+\", GitVersion:\"v1.12.9-gke.7\" [...]}\r\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"12+\", GitVersion:\"v1.12.8-gke.10\" [...]} \r\n```\r\n\r\nCloud Provider/Platform (AKS, GKE, Minikube etc.): GKE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/6561/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/6561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
