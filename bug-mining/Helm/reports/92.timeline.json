am writing this pr, which can implement the json replacement for a key mentioned in the issues, but there are several problems here, and K8s has encountered similar problems.\r\n\r\nAnd according to the existing helm design, the actual effect is not to replace the value of entire key, but to cover the specific value. In addition, ambiguity arises when dealing with arrays:\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the original values.yaml is as follows:\r\n````\r\nspec:\r\n  ....\r\n  sNssaiUpfInfoList:\r\n  - sNssai:\r\n      sd: 0002f0\r\n      sst: 1\r\n    dnnUpfInfoList:\r\n    - dnn: intranet\r\n      ipv4AddressRanges:\r\n      - end: 9.9.9.94\r\n        start: 9.9.9.65\r\n  ....\r\n````\r\n\r\nAfter \"--set-json 'spec.sNssaiUpfInfoList[0]=[{\"dnnUpfInfoList\":[{\"dnn\":\"intranet\",\"ipv4AddressRanges\":[{\"end\":\"9.9.9.100\"}]}]}]'\"\r\n\r\nThe result obtained is actually:\r\n\r\n(append to the array `dnnUpfInfoList`)\r\n\r\n````\r\nspec:\r\n  ....\r\n  sNssaiUpfInfoList:\r\n  - sNssai:\r\n      sd: 0002f0\r\n      sst: 1\r\n    dnnUpfInfoList:\r\n\r\n    - dnn: intranet\r\n

original array `dnnUpfInfoList`):\r\n\r\n````\r\nspec:\r\n  ....\r\n  sNssaiUpfInfoList:\r\n  - sNssai:\r\n      sd: 0002f0\r\n      sst: 1\r\n    dnnUpfInfoList:\r\n\r\n    - dnn: intranet\r\n      ipv4AddressRanges:\r\n      - end: 9.9.9.100\r\n\r\n  ....\r\n````\r\n\r\nbut not (merge by `dnn: intranet`):\r\n\r\n````\r\nspec:\r\n  ....\r\n  sNssaiUpfInfoList:\r\n  - sNssai:\r\n      sd:

the values ​​of helm do not have a design similar to **patchStrategy**, it is impossible to know whether the user wants to merge according to some item's trait in the array, or append the item ​​into the array, or even replace all the elements of the

used with helm install, helm template, helm upgrade, it enables\r\nto set json values (scalars/objects/arrays) from the command line.\r\n\r\nCloses #10428\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Luca Di Rocco <lucadirocco@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nThis PR allows to set any key of the exposed values (scalars, objects, arrays) of a chart, by using a json value on the command line.\r\nIt become easier and more concise to update entire portions of the exposed values, as json data structures on command line, rather than setting the value of each individual leaf attribute of the data structure (#10428 provides an example) \r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\nThe implementation has tried to reuse as much as possible the existing code and the standard libraries, and is quite straightforward.\r\nThere are some obvious changes in cmd/helm/flags.go and pkg/cli/values/options.go in order to include the new option flag (--set-json)\r\nThe parser logic from pkg/strvals/parser.go is reused, with an extra field in the parser struct (isjsonval bool, true only for --set-json) and some extra code in the following two functions, to parse a json value when a \"=\" char is met:\r\nfunc (t *parser) key(data map[string]interface{}) (reterr error)\r\nfunc (t *parser) listItem(list []interface{}, i int) ([]interface{}, error) \r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [X] this PR contains documentation  \r\n        Little updates in the description constants of cmd/helm/install.go and cmd/helm/upgrade.go to.\r\n        Together with the info from cmd/helm/flags.go, this should update the documentation when \"helm docs --type markdown --generate-headers\" is executed.\r\n- [X] this PR contains unit tests\r\n        Some extra unit tests with function TestParseJSON in pkg/strvals/parser_test.go\r\n- [X] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n        All unit test run, I don't know if something else is required. Being this a new feature, there are no changes in existing functionalities.\r\n        Please note that I had also to remove the ending new line '\\n' from an errors.Errorf statement in the  \r\nfunc compare(actual []byte, filename string) error, in file ./internal/test/test.go, because go lint was failing and also tests were not running.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/10693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/10693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6121021553,"node_id":"REFE_lADOApspmc4_z8O1zwAAAAFs12Bx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/6121021553","actor":{"login":"lucadirocco","id":44836068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM2MDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44836068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco","html_url":"https://github.com/lucadirocco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fd48201b223f3979124868d2c9ad81477de8dc8c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lucadirocco/helm/commits/fd48201b223f3979124868d2c9ad81477de8dc8c","created_at":"2022-02-22T21:19:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6194837175,"node_id":"REFE_lADOApspmc4_z8O1zwAAAAFxPba3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/6194837175","actor":{"login":"lucadirocco","id":44836068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM2MDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44836068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco","html_url":"https://github.com/lucadirocco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"11e7d0cd73fb924d3347228c68d10ccdb123b6c6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lucadirocco/helm/commits/11e7d0cd73fb924d3347228c68d10ccdb123b6c6","created_at":"2022-03-07T13:21:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/1081590544","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/10428#issuecomment-1081590544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/10428","id":1081590544,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApspmc5Ad8MQ","user":{"login":"lucadirocco","id":44836068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM2MDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44836068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco","html_url":"https://github.com/lucadirocco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucadirocco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-29T08:37:16Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T08:37:16Z","body":"Hello
