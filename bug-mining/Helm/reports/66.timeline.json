 Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\n\r\nThis helps to avoid rendering manifests which are only used for test execution.\r\n\r\n    \r\nWhen helm template is called with `--skip-tests` no manifests with helm test hook annotations are rendered.\r\n\r\nCloses #8691\r\n\r\nNOTE: I updated description to reflect revised implementation. It now only ignores resources with helm test annotation and not everything within tests directory.\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\n- `skipTests` defaults to `false` to keep backwards compatibility\r\n- I used the existing `testcharts/subchart` for testing and fixed Kubernetes warnings along the way when I was trying to install the chart locally. It's now valid and can be installed. \r\n  By using an existing test I did not have to write add and additional test case which check rendering if `skip-tests` is not used. f you prefer to create a different chart for testing just let me know and I will adapt.\r\n- How should I update the documentation? Is there a make target or something else which can be used to generate cobra docs?\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [x] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8703/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8703/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3799858413,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3OTk4NTg0MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3799858413","actor":{"login":"bacongobbler","id":1360539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/bacongobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T19:52:47Z","label":{"name":"feature","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/749853506","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8691#issuecomment-749853506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8691","id":749853506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTg1MzUwNg==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-23T00:42:03Z","updated_at":"2020-12-23T00:42:03Z","body":"This issue has been marked as stale because it has been open for 90 days with no activity.
