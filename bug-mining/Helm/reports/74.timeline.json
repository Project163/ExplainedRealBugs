this PR does / why we need it**:\r\n`storage.Create` cleans up the least-recent release versions. Prior to this PR, when clean up failed, it would ignore the error. This meant that a user that relied on the least-recent release version cleanup would not be notified if that cleanup failed, and release versions could grow without bound.\r\n\r\nUsers have no alternative in helm itself to clean up least-recent release versions. There was a proposal for a `prune` command (#5944), but it was not implemented.\r\n\r\nCloses #9145.\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\nThe first commit is a unit test. It fails, because release cleanup fails, but `storage.Create` does not return an error. The second commit is the fix. With the fix, the unit test passes.\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [ ] this PR has been tested for backwards
