 Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `helm ls --$state` operation would display outdated\r\nreleases under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nGiven the following set of releases:\r\n```\r\nNAME  REVISION  UPDATED                   STATUS    CHART      APP VERSION  NAMESPACE\r\nbar   1         Wed Apr  8 16:54:39 2020  DEPLOYED  bar-4.0.0  1.0          default\r\nfoo   1         Fri Feb  7 06:16:56 2020  DEPLOYED  foo-0.1.0  1.0          default\r\nfoo   2         Mon May  4 07:16:56 2020  FAILED    foo-0.1.0  1.0          default\r\nfoo   3         Mon May  4 07:20:00 2020  FAILED    foo-0.1.0  1.0          default\r\nfoo   4         Tue May  5 08:16:56 2020  DEPLOYED  foo-0.2.0  1.0          default\r\nqux   1         Tue Jun  9 10:32:00 2020  DEPLOYED  qux-4.0.3  1.0          default\r\nqux   2         Tue Jun  9 10:57:00 2020  FAILED    qux-4.0.3  1.0          default\r\n```\r\n\r\n`helm ls --failed` produced the following output:\r\n```\r\nNAME  REVISION  UPDATED                   STATUS    CHART      APP VERSION  NAMESPACE\r\nfoo   3         Mon May  4 07:20:00 2020  FAILED    foo-0.1.0  1.0          default\r\nqux   2         Tue Jun  9 10:57:00 2020  FAILED    qux-4.0.0  1.0          default\r\n```\r\n\r\nIncluding the `qux` release in that `helm ls --failed` output is not\r\ncontroversial; the most recent revision of `qux` was not successful\r\nand an operator should investigate.\r\n\r\nIncluding the `foo` release in the output, however, is\r\nquestionable. Revision 3 of `foo` is _not_ the most recent release of\r\n`foo`, and that FAILED release was fixed in a susubsequent upgrade. A\r\nuser may see that FAILED deploy and start taking inappropriate\r\naction. Further, that issue was fixed months ago in this example --\r\ntroubleshooting an old deploy may not be safe if significant changes\r\nhave occurred. Concern over this behavior was raised in\r\nhttps://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7495.\r\n\r\nThis behavior applied to all the state filter flags (--deployed,\r\n--failed, --pending, etc.), and a user could pass multiple state\r\nfilter flags to a single command. The previous behavior can be\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\nFor each release name, all release revisions having any of the\r\nsupplied state flags were retrieved, and the most recent revision\r\namong these was returned (regardless of whether a newer revision of an\r\nunspecified state exists).\r\n\r\nThis change request alters the helm list action to match user\r\nexpectations such that only \"current\" releases are shown when\r\nfiltering on release state. After this change, the following output\r\nwould be produced by `helm ls --failed`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNAME  REVISION  UPDATED                   STATUS    CHART      APP VERSION  NAMESPACE\r\nqux   2         Tue Jun  9 10:57:00 2020  FAILED    qux-4.0.0  1.0          default\r\n```\r\nThe command now returns only `qux` because it is the only \"current\" FAILED release.\r\n\r\nThis behavior change applies to all the state filters _except_\r\n`superseded`, which now becomes a special case. By definition, at\r\nleast one newer release exists ahead of each superseded release. A\r\nconditional is included in this change request to maintain the\r\npreexisting behavior (return \"most recent\" superseded revison for\r\neach release name) if the superseded state filter is requested.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote that there is an alternate perspective that a state filter flag\r\nshould return all releases of a given state rather than only the\r\n\"current\" releases. In the above example, `helm ls --failed` with this\r\nalternate approach would return the following:\r\n```\r\nNAME  REVISION  UPDATED                   STATUS    CHART      APP VERSION  NAMESPACE\r\nfoo   2         Mon May  4 07:16:56 2020  FAILED    foo-0.1.0  1.0          default\r\nfoo   3         Mon May  4 07:20:00 2020  FAILED    foo-0.1.0  1.0          default\r\nqux   2         Tue Jun  9 10:57:00 2020  FAILED    qux-4.0.0  1.0          default\r\n```\r\nMultiple FAILED `foo` revisions are included in the output, unlike the current behavior.\r\n\r\nThis approach is logical and achievable. It allows a user to find\r\nexactly what is requested: all historical releases of a given\r\nstate. In order to achieve continuity with helm behavior, however, a\r\nnew filter (something like \"current\") would probably need to be\r\nimplemented and made the new default.\r\n\r\nGiven current helm behavior as well as the comments in the #7495, I\r\ndid not pursue this approach.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTechnical details:\r\n\r\n - Moved list action state mask filter after latest release filter\r\n\r\nPreviously, the list operation in helm/pkg/action/list.go skipped\r\nreleases that were not covered by the state mask on _retrieval_ from\r\nthe Releases store:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresults, err := l.cfg.Releases.List(func(rel *release.Release) bool {\r\n\t\t// Skip anything that the mask doesn't cover\r\n\t\tcurrentStatus := l.StateMask.FromName(rel.Info.Status.String())\r\n\t\tif l.StateMask&currentStatus == 0 {\r\n\t\t\treturn false\r\n\t\t}\r\n                ...\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/helm/helm/blob/8ea6b970ecd02365a230420692350057d48278e5/pkg/action/list.go#L154-L159\r\n\r\nWhile filtering on retrieval in this manner avoided an extra iteration\r\nthrough the entire list to check on the supplied condition later, it\r\nintroduced the possibility of returning an outdated release to the\r\nuser because newer releases (that would have otherwise squashed\r\noutdated releases in the `filterList` function) are simply not\r\nincluded in the set of working records.\r\n\r\nThis change moves the state mask filtering process to _after_ the set\r\nof current releases is built. Outdated, potentially misleading\r\nreleases are scrubbed out prior to the application of the state mask\r\nfilter.\r\n\r\nAs written, this state mask filtration (in the new `filterStateMask`\r\nmethod on `*List`) incurs an additional, potentially expensive\r\niteration over the set of releases to return to the user. An\r\nalternative approach could avoid that extra iteration and fit this\r\nlogic into the existing `filterList` function at the cost of making\r\n`filterList` function a little harder to understand.\r\n\r\n - Rename filterList to filterLatestReleases for clarity\r\n\r\nAnother function that filters the list is added, so update\r\nto the more descriptive name here.\r\n\r\n - List superseded releases without filtering for latest\r\n\r\nThis change makes superseded releases a special case, as they would\r\n_never_ be displayed otherwise (by definition, as superseded releases have been\r\nreplaced by a newer release), so a conditional maintains current\r\nbehavior (\"return newest superseded revision for each release name\")\r\n\r\nFixes #7495.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Andrew
