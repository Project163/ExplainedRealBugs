A new variable (something like `HELM_DATA_HOME`) that overrides both the default path AND the XDG_DATA_HOME variable.\r\n\r\nThis would be useful in github workflow which overwrites the HOME variable and attaches a volume to that path when executing a container such that plugins installed in the home folder at build time will be lost.
