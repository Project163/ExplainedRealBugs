So in the `mychart/values.yaml` (which acts as the defaults) of my Helm chart, i set all the top level values that Helmet expects, for example:\r\n\r\n`mychart/Chart.yaml`:\r\n```\r\n(...)\r\nname: mychart\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - name: redis\r\n    repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami\r\n    version: 18.1.1\r\n  - name: helmet\r\n    version: 0.9.1\r\n    repository: https://companyinfo.github.io/helm-charts\r\n    import-values: # <== It is mandatory if you want to import the Helmet default values.\r\n      - defaults\r\n  - name: common\r\n    version: 2.x.x\r\n    repository: \"https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami\"\r\n    tags:\r\n      - bitnami-common\r\n```\r\n\r\n`mychart/values.yaml`:\r\n```\r\nimage:\r\n  repository: nginx\r\n\r\nextraVolumes:\r\n  - name: tmp\r\n    emptyDir: {}\r\n\r\nextraVolumeMounts:\r\n  - name: tmp\r\n    mountPath: /opt/plugandwork/apps/rce/current/tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese should act as the defaults, so i do not have to give any values when i run `helm install mychart`\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\n\r\nHelmet does not create any Deployment, nor Volumes in the Deployment config\r\n\r\nTo make it work, i have to remove the settings from `mychart/values.yaml` and set them into a top level `myvalues.yaml` file given to Helm with `helm install --values myvalues.yaml mychart`\r\n\r\nTo my understanding, this makes Helmet quite unusable for more complex apps written on other dependency Helm charts\r\n\r\nOr maybe i am using Helmet wrong, if then what is the correct way ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/companyinfo/helm-charts/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/companyinfo/helm-charts/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/1758716848","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12460#issuecomment-1758716848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/12460","id":1758716848,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApspmc5o0-Ow","user":{"login":"zevisert","id":11222441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjIyNDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11222441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert","html_url":"https://github.com/zevisert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zevisert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-12T00:05:19Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T00:05:19Z","body":"@mattfarina I think this should make things work like most people would expect again.

precedence of imported values from library charts via *imported-values* in Chart.yaml. The following commit introduced that change: https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/5d017e11f1f47345a3559bf70f63d81a7edc981a.\r\n\r\nAn illustration for this behavior change can be seen in the following repository https://github.com/albgp22/helm-values-issue but can be stated simply as follows: when we import a value from a given library via *imported-values* in Chart.yaml file in our application chart, the value gets ignored if it is already present in the values.yaml file.\r\n\r\nAs this precedence change potentially breaks compatibility of existing charts with newer helm versions, I wonder if it will be reverted in future helm versions. As I see it, imported values from libraries overriding the ones in the application *values.yaml* file was the expected and logical

But if there is any chance that it will be reverted again, then Flux devs may abandon their efforts to migrate to Helm 3.14.\r\n\r\nRef:\r\n* https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/12480\r\n* https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12511\r\n* https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12599\r\n* https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12677\r\n* https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12730\r\n* https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-controller/issues/878\r\n* https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12488\r\n\r\nAgain, I am asking for clarification only because right now there is an incompatibility that I'm not fully briefed on which **prevents** Flux from upgrading to Helm 3.14.x, if someone from the Helm project can weigh in, it may save us from some waste cycles, or help us better direct our efforts here.\r\n\r\nThanks

Can we have some comment from the maintainers of Helm whether 3.13 or 3.14 was an error and might be reverted again - right now Flux v2.2.2 is running Helm 3.13 and at least @hedayat here has a use case that prefers the 3.13 (and <3.8.2) behavior. I understand that it has been changed again in 3.14.\r\n\r\nHi @kingdonb and @hedayat, appreciate you raising this and asking again. Thanks for your patience and community collaboration.\r\n\r\nWe know there are a handful of people who are trying to reconcile which version of Helm had breaking changes and which ones fix them.\r\n\r\nMaintainers have replied to questions and comments in issues and PRs, and have discussed these in weekly Helm dev meetings. However, I acknowledge we could be better about communicating where we are at with this, given that it seems to be not fully resolved for all use cases.\r\n\r\nAbout the versions. While Helm values handling has worked for the majority of users, for less common use cases there have been several previous bugs for years. We attempted to fix some of these in Helm 3.13, but that introduced breaking changes we missed. We fixed the breaking changes in 3.14, but that seems to have introduced related bugs for other use cases like @hedayat’s. There may be versions or details I missed here, but we can test/document them together.\r\n\r\nFor now, we are working on Helm values handling as a high priority:\r\n- several dedicated working sessions over the past few weeks\r\n- discussed again in yesterday's weekly Helm dev meeting\r\n- currently clarifying the intended behavior for each method of managing values in Helm charts and their dependencies in [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjmIc5VYzNbaJ-SQ6nT02Oo1t9ctlvomufP8ulR6q70/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment on that Google doc, just bear in mind it is very much a work in progress at present.\r\n\r\nA good way to help this effort is to document your use cases. This would help us ensure there are automated tests for each, to catch bugs that would impact your use cases before any future PRs are merged.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions about this or other ideas on how you can help, the weekly Helm dev meetings are a good place to engage or coordinate with maintainers working on this.
