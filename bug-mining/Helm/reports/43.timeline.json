#7277 was merged is was intended to create shasums accessible\r\nin a way shasum -c or sha256sum could use to verify the files the\r\nHelm project ships. The solution created a new file named\r\nshasums.txt. This setup contained a few problems:\r\n\r\n1. The new file file was not uploaded to get.helm.sh for someone\r\n   to download and use.\r\n2. The file had not version in the naming or path. This means that\r\n   each new release of Helm will overwrite it. Downloading and\r\n   validating an old file is impossible.\r\n3. If one downloads a single file, the shasums.txt file, and uses\r\n   shasum -c it will return an exit code that is 1. This is because\r\n   of missing files as it is looking for all the files from the\r\n   release.\r\n4. The shasums.txt file is not signed for verification like the\r\n   other files.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes these problems with the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Instead of a shasums.txt file there is a .sha256sum file for\r\n  each package. For example, helm-3.1.0-linux-amd64.zip.sha256sum.\r\n  This file will can be used with `shasum -a 256 -c` to verify\r\n  the single file helm-3.1.0-linux-amd64.zip. The exit code of\r\n  checking a single file is 0 if the file passes.\r\n* This new .sha256sum file is signed just like the .tar.gz, .zip,\r\n  and .sha256 files. The provenance can be verified.\r\n* The file name starts with `helm-` meaning the existing upload\r\n  script in the deploy.sh file will move it to get.helm.sh.\r\n\r\nNote, the existing .sha256 file can be deprecated and removed\r\nin Helm v4 with the new .sha256sum file taking over. But,\r\nfor backwards compatibility with scripts it needs to be kept\r\nduring v3.\r\n\r\nCloses
