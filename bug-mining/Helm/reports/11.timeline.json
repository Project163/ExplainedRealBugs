So under what conditions can a chart that contains a CRD upgrade the CRD?\r\n- Deletion of a CRD: When a CRD is deleted, all of its instances are deleted. And CRDs are global. Under what conditions can Helm delete a CRD (clearly, it's not by default)\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the above makes it easier to solve the first point. But is it in any way helping or hindering with the others? I don't want to take a shot at solving just one prong, only to discover that that solution prevented us from solving the others.\r\n\r\nThe proposal does not explain what the mechanics of the `crd/` directory are. Are CRD YAML files treated as templates, too? Do they get the same context as other templates? Are they always evaluated BEFORE the others? And if so, can anything be injected from the CRD template eval into the context used for regular eval? What happens if a non-CRD is placed in the `crd` directory? For example, if I have a deployment that is a CRD controller, it is often necessary for that controller to be up and running before instances can be reliably processed. So do I put the controller objects in the CRD folder?\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/500930798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"technosophos","id":89193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos","html_url":"https://github.com/technosophos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technosophos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/500941782","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5871#issuecomment-500941782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/5871","id":500941782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDk0MTc4Mg==","user":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T17:22:01Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T17:22:01Z","body":"Just [spitballing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spitball)...\r\n\r\n> Install order: CRDs have to be installed in a separate operation from any usage of (instances of) that CRD.\r\n\r\nThe CRD directory would make it easy to figure out where they were to install them first.

For example, we could render all the CRDs in the chart and sub-charts first and then install them before installing the rest (just an example, the idea is we can use it to make the right decisions). I guess there's no reason we can't do this with the current `crd-install` hook, but I'm not sure what the future of hooks are in Helm 3 and I also feel like annotations aren't the best way of defining these if we have the opportunity to extend the chart format.\r\n\r\nCompletely agree with @mattfarina's comment, Helm should not try to do anything clever in most of these scenarios, I think the goal here would be to just provide more info to the operator so that they can decide how to
