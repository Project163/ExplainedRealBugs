Version info\r\nOutput of **helm version**: v3 canary build 4/4/2020\r\nOutput of **kubectl version**: 1.16.2\r\nCloud Provider/**Platform** (AKS, GKE, Minikube etc.): Minishift\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nRecently support for insecure registries has been added:\r\n\r\n- Initial ticket: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5434\r\n- Pull request: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7254\r\n\r\nAlthough adding the insecure registries works perfectly, we cannot pull/install/upgrade images due to TLS verification still being done.\r\n\r\n### Configuration:\r\nHelm 'repositories.yaml' configuration:\r\n```\r\napiVersion: \"\"\r\ngenerated: \"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\r\nrepositories:\r\n- caFile: \"\"\r\n  certFile: \"\"\r\n  insecure_skip_tls_verify: true\r\n  keyFile: \"\"\r\n  name: fluxcd\r\n  password: \"\"\r\n  url: https://<helm-repository>/repository/helm-fluxcd/\r\n  username: \"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nWhen pulling the chart we get following error:\r\n```\r\nbamboo@app-bamboo-agent-5:~$ helm pull fluxcd/flux\r\nError: Get https://<helm-repository>/repository/helm-fluxcd/flux-1.3.0.tgz: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority\r\n```\r\nJust making sure by specyfing the repo directly:\r\n```\r\nbamboo@app-bamboo-agent-5:~$ helm pull fluxcd/flux --repo https://repo.crelan-int.be/repository/helm-fluxcd/\r\nError: looks like \"https://<helm-repository>/repository/helm-fluxcd/\" is not a valid chart repository or cannot be reached: Get https://<helm-repository>/repository/helm-fluxcd/index.yaml: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority\r\n```\r\n### Fix\r\nCurrent `pull`, `install` and `upgrade` commands should keep into account that TLS verification is not required if the repository is marked as insecure.
