looking around at the code, I think the output change was very intentional, but it probably was not discussed very well. The `--debug` flag as it stands now actually outputs all the logging and isn't tied to outputting other kinds of data. It seems like the debug flag now has a conflated meaning as it has to do more with additional logging/context and not with the final output of a command. So, my question is whether we want another flag to indicate we want this output or if we should just include it by default? For now I am going to make it work with `--debug`, but wanted to raise this point of conversation\r\n\r\n@endzyme Are the original values something you'd want to actually be stored in the release (like in the backing secret)? I would prefer not to because that would start to balloon out the size of the release object (which already get kind of big), so my thinking was to have it be on the object in memory, but not actually write it out to storage. Would that be an ok
