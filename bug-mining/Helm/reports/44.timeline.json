Could you please provide your use cases for us? In there, could you describe your needs around CRDs and CRs from those CRDs. I want to work on Helm CRDs in 2020 either in a plugin or in Helm itself. I expect the work to start in a plugin as it will initially be experimental.\r\n\r\nFor context... CRDs are difficult. The Kubernetes project has not provided clear guidance on using them either in docs or codified. This has left many people to use them for many different things and in different ways. Sometimes those ways work well for projects but go against what people on the Kubernetes project say you \"should\" do. This has made it hard for Helm to codify CRD handling for many use cases.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/580782347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2997505288,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk5NzUwNTI4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/2997505288","actor":{"login":"moduspwnens","id":1111129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTExMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens","html_url":"https://github.com/moduspwnens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-31T15:36:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2997505294,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5OTc1MDUyOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/2997505294","actor":{"login":"moduspwnens","id":1111129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTExMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens","html_url":"https://github.com/moduspwnens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-31T15:36:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/580794849","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7505#issuecomment-580794849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7505","id":580794849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDc5NDg0OQ==","user":{"login":"moduspwnens","id":1111129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTExMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens","html_url":"https://github.com/moduspwnens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"20

@mattfarina. I've read some of the other discussion topics here about it and I understand it's tricky and (from my perspective) may not be universally solvable by Helm alone.\r\n\r\nIn our case, we're building what is (at this point) a Kubernetes-based appliance that performs various packet processing features on the appliance's underlying network (not the pod network). Instead of building our own declarative API, permissions, etc. for defining how to encrypt, decrypt, route, inspect, or otherwise handle that underlying network traffic, we've created CRDs so our app (or a savvy user) can declaratively configure our box to handle that traffic. Think like a *PacketHandlingPolicy* CRD, a *PacketEncryptionConfiguration* CRD, and similar.\r\n\r\nBecause it's only our application using them and (currently) we're only targeting an appliance-based model, we feel comfortable ensuring CRD changes apply cleanly as plain upgrades such that Helm can upgrade them the same way it would any other resource. We won't upgrade them in ways that aren't backward compatible.\r\n\r\nFor deletes, from our perspective, if the user wants to delete the chart, s/he wants to remove the application completely. And frequently as part of development and QA, we'll want to delete the chart so we can install a fresh version. With CRDs not being deleted, we're not in a clean state for a fresh install. So we'd want them to be uninstalled, too.\r\n\r\nNow naturally using our own CRDs, CRs, and controllers, some CRs are created with finalizers that don't get removed when Helm deletes the controllers, so I did develop a delete hook that clears out those finalizers and deletes any resources our project creates that Helm wouldn't have known about. We just label those resources with a key and value indicating the Helm release name, so the hook loops through all resources in the apiserver and deletes / removes finalizers from resources with that label.\r\n\r\nNot ideal, of course, but I haven't yet seen a great pattern for this. I expect virtually any operator-style Kubernetes project would have the same issue. It'll define some CRD, and if a user creates a CR instance of it that requires any kind of cleanup, the operator will need to add a finalizer for it (so that cleanup can be done before the instance is fully deleted). That CR is outside the scope of Helm, so if Helm comes through and deletes the operator and the CRD instance, it'll be stuck in \"terminating\" because the CR instance still has that finalizer and the operator that would remove it is gone.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to see you're working on a plugin! Without it, I'm not sure of a strong path forward for us other than to remove all CRDs from the chart and install / upgrade them without Helm. This adds some complexity for us, since we were using the Helm chart as \"the build artifact\" to publish / share. For us to get back to a \"single build artifact\" to do an install / upgrade / delete, we'll likely need to look into CNAB or some other spec for packaging a build artifact that can both do the CRD install / upgrade step and the \"helm install\" step. And then it can handle deletes, too.\r\n\r\nSorry about the wall of text but it's tough to give the full context of our use case without the details. This is definitely a tough problem to solve and I appreciate your efforts.\r\n\r\nEDIT: And please let me know if you have any ideas of how some of these issues might be better solved with a different design. It can sometimes be easy to miss alternative design ideas with newer software paradigms.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/580794849/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"moduspwnens","id":1111129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTExMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens","html_url":"https://github.com/moduspwnens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moduspwnens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2997614506,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk5NzYxNDUwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/2997614506","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-31T16:05:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2997614514,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5OTc2MTQ1MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/2997614514","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-31T16:05:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3002888472,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwMDI4ODg0NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3002888472","actor":{"login":"bacongobbler","id":1360539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/bacongobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-03T16:26:13Z","label":{"name":"question/support","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_githu
