They still are if I use Helm 3.0.2, and that was our desired behavior.\r\n\r\nWe've avoided the *crds* directory (and the prior *crd-install* hook) because for our use case, we *do* want CRDs to just be treated like normal resources (that is, upgraded and deleted). I understand that puts us in an odd spot relative to the Helm project's plans (i.e. not deleting or upgrading CRDs), but I'd at least expect an upgrade with only a patch number revision (3.0.2 to 3.0.3) to not break backward compatibility in this way.\r\n\r\nThe commit that changes this behavior seems to be here:\r\nhttps://github.com/helm/helm/commit/9711d1c6bfd9cd0cebe47b069a18cfc83ac3bfee\r\n\r\nWe'll plan to get our deployment model for our CRDs in-line with Helm's plans for the long-term future.","closed_by":{"login":"hickeyma","id":14892004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyMDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14892004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma","html_url":"https://github.com/hickeyma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hickeyma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7505/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
