What is the proposed way of configuring subcharts? \r\n\r\nThe docs in https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/#creating-a-subchart might need some updates on this as well.

Commenting out the `ca` dependency and then calling `helm dependency update` will allow the other dependencies to be downloaded into `charts/`.\r\n\r\n**Version of Helm and Kubernetes**:\r\nHelm
