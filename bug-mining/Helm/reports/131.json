change [this function call](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/pkg/chartutil/chartfile.go#L36) in pkg/chartutil to the [strict version](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/yaml/blob/master/yaml.go#L63) (`yaml.UnmarshalStrict`)\r\n  - ~~check the resulting Metadata struct has a non-empty Name, a required field [according to this comment](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/pkg/chart/metadata.go#L48)~~ this shouldn't be necessary, we can just use the error return value of the unmarshal function as we currently do\r\n\r\nHappy to submit a PR with this change!\r\n\r\nMinimal steps to reproduce:\r\n  - `helm create testy-mctest`\r\n  - update `Chart.yaml` with example above (or any key duplicated)\r\n   - `helm lint`\r\n   \r\nOutput of `helm version`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nversion.BuildInfo{Version:\"v3.10.2\", GitCommit:\"50f003e5ee8704ec937a756c646870227d7c8b58\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", GoVersion:\"go1.18.8\"}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"scottrigby","id":407675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzY3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/407675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby","html_url":"https://github.com/scottrigby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottrigby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/12381/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/12381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
