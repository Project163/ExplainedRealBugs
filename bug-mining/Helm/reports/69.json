This worked fine in version `v3.3.1` and earlier.  It now fails in `v3.3.2` and `v3.3.3`.  This is a breaking change that has broken automation relying on `helm` and tools `helmfile`.\r\n\r\n### Steps  to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```bash \r\nhelm repo add jaegertracing https://jaegertracing.github.io/helm-charts\r\nhelm repo add jaegertracing https://jaegertracing.github.io/helm-charts\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Results\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"jaegertracing\" has been added to your repositories\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected that the command would be idempotent and would not fail.  As the repository was already added, it would not need to be added again, and thus should to exist with an error.\r\n\r\n### Actual Results\r\n\r\nDespite the repository already in the desired state, helm exits with an error, even though there is no error.  `helm` will exit with `1` indicated an error.  This destroys any automation scripts and tools like `helmfile` to function correctly.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: repository name (jaegertracing) already exists, please specify a different name\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput of `helm version`:\r\n```\r\nversion.BuildInfo{Version:\"v3.3.3\", GitCommit:\"55e3ca022e40fe200fbc855938995f40b2a68ce0\", GitTreeState:\"dirty\", GoVersion:\"go1.15.2\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of `kubectl version`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClient Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"18\", GitVersion:\"v1.18.6\", GitCommit:\"dff82dc0de47299ab66c83c626e08b245ab19037\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2020-07-15T23:30:39Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.14.4\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"darwin/amd64\"}\r\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"17+\", GitVersion:\"v1.17.9-eks-4c6976\", GitCommit:\"4c6976793196d70bc5cd29d56ce5440c9473648e\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2020-07-17T18:46:04Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.13.9\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloud Provider/Platform (AKS, GKE, Minikube etc.): \r\n\r\n* EKS (K8S `v1.17.9-eks-4c6976`)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8771/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
