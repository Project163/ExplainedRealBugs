 Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\n\r\ncloses https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/13447\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to bring some structure into the error messages that helm will output. This structure is necessary so that readers of these error messages will naturally be able to identify important details like where the error occurred, and what the error actually is. For me, this problem comes about when you have complicated logic inside _helpers files, and is made worse when those _helpers call other _helpers.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this problem by adding whitespace to parts of the error message.  The structure of this format is : \r\n```\r\nfileLocation:lineNumber:colNumber\r\n  functionCallWithinFile\r\n    contentOfError\r\n```\r\nand in the unit test I added, a real world example would look like this:\r\n```\r\n        NestedHelperFunctions/templates/svc.yaml:1:9\r\n          executing \"NestedHelperFunctions/templates/svc.yaml\" at <include \"nested_helper.name\" .>: \r\n            error calling include:\r\n        NestedHelperFunctions/templates/_helpers_1.tpl:1:39\r\n          executing \"nested_helper.name\" at <include \"common.names.get_name\" .>: \r\n            error calling include:\r\n        NestedHelperFunctions/charts/common/templates/_helpers_2.tpl:1:50\r\n          executing \"common.names.get_name\" at <.Release.Name>: \r\n            nil pointer evaluating interface {}.Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change may introduce some risk that any added formatting logic may delete important parts of the error message.  As an attempt to address this, I use regex's to match against the known error messages from the parent golang text/template library, and if there is any part of the error that doesn't match those regex's,  the unformatted error message will be returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains user facing changes (the `docs needed`
