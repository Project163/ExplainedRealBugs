a testcase for https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/30880\r\n\r\nHere we add a test on `typeOf` that can be used in helm templates, so we validate there is no change in the behavior.\r\n\r\n## In details (issue)\r\n\r\nWith helm 3.18.0, we had a change in `typeIs`/`typeOf` gotemplate behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example in:\r\nhttps://github.com/oauth2-proxy/manifests/blob/4001c2385dc72990add71437b02e18d7ec7f8ffd/helm/oauth2-proxy/templates/_ingress.tpl#L40-L44\r\n\r\nWhile debugging, we saw that `typeOf .servicePort` has changed from `float64` to `json.Number`.\r\n\r\nThis could be a bad practice from the chart (that should probably use `KindIs`), but this is widely used and could break many charts.\r\n\r\nStep to reproduce:\r\n\r\nHelm 3.17.3:\r\n```sh\r\n$ helm repo add oauth2-proxy https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/manifests\r\n\"oauth2-proxy\" has been added to your repositories\r\n\r\n$

OK\r\n```\r\n\r\nHelm 3.18.0:\r\n```sh\r\n$ helm version\r\nversion.BuildInfo{Version:\"v3.18.0\", GitCommit:\"cc58e3f5a3aa615c6a86275e6f4444b5fdd3cc4e\", GitTreeState:\"clean\",
