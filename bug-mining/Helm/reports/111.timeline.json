#11773\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nThis change updates readiness check in ready.go to correctly account for statefulsets that are utilizing a partitioned upgrade. These statefulsets only upgrade a subset of the managed pods with each call to helm upgrade. This causes the upgrade to legitimately hit the condition where sts.status.CurrentRevision != sts.Status.UpdateRevision which causes helm to mark the upgrade has failed when in fact it is successful.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes that behavior to only check when partition is unspecified or 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [*] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [*] this PR has been tested for backwards

was able to reproduce this. When we do a partitioned upgrade of a StatefulSet, the status has following content after StatefulSet is successfully upgraded. (partition was set to 2, replicas is 3).\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"availableReplicas\": 3,\r\n  \"collisionCount\": 0,\r\n  \"observedGeneration\": 2,\r\n  \"readyReplicas\": 3,\r\n  \"replicas\": 3,\r\n  \"currentReplicas\": 2,\r\n  \"currentRevision\": \"web-6b4fd5c9f6\",\r\n  \"updatedReplicas\": 1,\r\n  \"updateRevision\": \"web-5fbd8d85bc\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis basically says there are 2 replicas with currentRevision (old), and there is 1 replica with updateRevision (new). When the partition number changes this will move and eventually we will have same value of currentReplicas and updatedReplicas i.e. 3, and same value of currentRevision and updateRevision i.e. `web-5fbd8d85bc`\r\n\r\nThis is with partition 0, and replicas 3.\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"availableReplicas\": 3,\r\n  \"collisionCount\": 0,\r\n  \"observedGeneration\": 3,\r\n  \"readyReplicas\":

look at kubectl rollout code (which is similar to what we are trying to achieve), they don't check the revision for partitioned rollouts, they just return with success or failure in case it is a partitioned rollout.\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/blob/3ec401449e5821ad954942c7ecec9d2c90ecaaa1/pkg/polymorphichelpers/rollout_status.go#L136-L145\r\nAnd after this they have check for
