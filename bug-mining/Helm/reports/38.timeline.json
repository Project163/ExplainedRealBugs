[#6713](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6713)\r\n\r\nHave updated the error message for the missing Chart.\r\nPlease do let me know if there is anything wrong, I will try to fix it.\r\nI have created test for my change for helm/pkg/chart/metadata.go in helm/pkg/chart/metadata_test.go\r\n\r\nI raised a PR for this earlier, creating a new one as I lost my work.\r\n\r\n@karuppiah7890 , As you suggested in the last PR [#7006](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7006)\r\n\r\n> Thanks for the PR. It looks like it doesn't consider the issue that you have linked to. #6713 issue is about helm not giving an appropriate or accurate error for package sub command when the chart itself doesn't exist. Your test seems to be related to chart.yaml file not existing. Could you change the test according to the issue ? Make sure it's a failing test and then you can pass the test by fixing the code :)\r\n\r\nI have made some changes while will give an error as you suggested(talking about the whole chart not only the Chart.yaml file.)\r\n\r\nThank You
