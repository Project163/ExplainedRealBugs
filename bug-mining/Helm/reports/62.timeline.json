 Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nCloses #7174\r\n\r\nPreviously in Helm 2, `helm repo add` would prompt for your password if you only provided the `--username` flag. This helps prevent someone's credentials from being logged in their shell's history, from showing up in process lists, and from being seen by others nearby.\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\nThis is my first time contributing to a large open-source project, please let me know if anything else is needed or desired and I'll do my best to address the concerns as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [ ] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [ ] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/8431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3535698869,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzUzNTY5ODg2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/3535698869","actor":{"login":"bacongobbler","id":1360539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/bacongobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-10T23:03:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/656933437","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7174#issuecomment-656933437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/7174","id":656933437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NjkzMzQzNw==","user":{"login":"bridgetkromhout","id":2104453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2104453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout","html_url":"https://github.com/bridgetkromhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bridgetkromhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-10T23:12:52Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T23:12:52Z","body":"@bacongobbler
