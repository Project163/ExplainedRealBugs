@bacongobbler , interested in the content of the pull request, I fall on your question/comment.\r\n\r\n### As easy as Do, Re, Mi (1, 2, 3)\r\n\r\n> How do you verify a pgp signature from a source you haven’t trusted yet?\r\n\r\nWhat does \"to trust a key \" means ? \r\n\r\nThe answer is in 1, 2, 3 : what does it mean to trust a key at level 3, and what does it means to trust it at level 5 ?\r\n\r\nAnswer : Nothing, it is non-sense. \r\n\r\n* You do not trust a key, you import it into your keyring.\r\n* key level of trust from 1 to 5 is : _\"Hey Linux, you can trust ar level 3 all binaries signed with that key\"_ .\r\n* oh wow great now linux can refine permissions related to : \r\n  *  how deep into the system the installation process goes (apt-get checks packages signatures, hum? ( Oh my, just checked out your profile, n I cannot resist : that's okay, your from microsoft ^^ - please sincerely forgive me, I'm sure you'll understand i could not resist ;)  ) )\r\n  * what the binary can, or cannot do (resources used)\r\n\r\n### Only other concept of Trust I can fathom about a key (All the branches of the learning tree)\r\n\r\n_\"I trust that this key, is the key of HashiCorp\"_ : Importing it, means that you trust, that this key is the actual Key of the Actual one true HashCorp Corporation. Not any one else's in the world.\r\n\r\nWhich is why I mention the trust that I can infer from a Keybase proof : \r\n* I trust that this key actually is the key of the guys who own the hashicorp org on github, and\r\n* I trust that this org on github, is owned by the acutal HashiCorp company, cause otherwise there would be the loudest law suit ever, for sure)\r\n### A, B, C\r\n\r\n* So , all in all : \r\n  * \"Oh, there is a key \"\r\n  * \"Oh I have a proof that htis key actually belongs to the HashiCorp Company\" (thanks to TLS not being shizophrenic)\r\n  * \"Hey, Do I trust HashiCorp distributed binaries, as long as I know they come from HashiCorp?\" (if yes I import the key, if not I dont have anything to install, so ....???)\r\n  * \"Yes, boss, I put my  professional credibility on HashiCorp distributed binaires, I have used their products for years, you can trust them blindly\" (because we devops, will never push any image to prod uinless we verified the binary is from HashiCorp, and not one bit was modified in the network journey.....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI like t guess based on behavior, black box testing, and then I guess : wy oh, wy, has he coded it like that ?\r\n\r\nSo I am absolutely asking anyone to correct , contradict me, I have read very litlle on the subject, I just understand math a little,  and like proving, crypto, and above all, guessing.\r\n\r\nSo I might be saying complete rubbish. \r\nYou should not trust me, 1, 2, 3.\r\nBut I will learn, for sure, my A, B, C, I know where I
