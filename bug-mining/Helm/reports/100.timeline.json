change was made that when validation was turned off the Kubernetes packages were building objects as a Table type. This was done for display purposes. When details about the objects was going to be printed as part of #10912.\r\n\r\nThis broke rollback, and possibly other functionality, as a Table type was returned in some cases that needed the regular object. This caused things to break silently.\r\n\r\nThe fix involved adding in a new Function (and interface) to query for tables instead of the objects themselves. There was not a clean way to add it to the existing function that covered all cases.\r\n\r\nA second problem was noticed along the way. When data was output via status as YAML or JSON it was in the form of a table rather than the objects themselves. This did not reflect expectations and did not match the functionality in kubectl. The code was updated to return a table when that was presented and the objects when they are being output for YAML or JSON. The API also supports this handling to SDK users can replicate this functionality.\r\n\r\nAPI changes made here were never released. The functions were developed for this release of Helm and only ever appeared in an RC. In this case, they can be changed.\r\n\r\nNote, extensive testing is not covered by this PR as our testing system doesn't have the ability to cover this :(. The additional testing needs can be covered in follow-up pull requests.\r\n\r\nFixes #11712\r\n\r\n<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**: There is a regression in 3.11.0-rc.1 that needs to be fixed before release\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\nTwo things:\r\n1. The lack of specific testing has to do with limitations of the testing system for things like this. That is additional future work we need to do.\r\n2. The API changes presented here are to things that have never been released so they are ok to do.\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [x] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/11720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/11720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8222742692,"node_id":"CE_lADOApspmc5bIGe0zwAAAAHqHRik","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/8222742692","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-13T16:57:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8222748267,"node_id":"REFE_lADOApspmc5bIGe0zwAAAAHqHS5r","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/8222748267","actor":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"472c5736ab01133de504a826bd9ee12cbe4e7904","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/commits/472c5736ab01133de504a826bd9ee12cbe4e7904","created_at":"2023-01-13T16:58:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/1382364845","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/11712#issuecomment-1382364845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/11712","id":1382364845,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApspmc5SZTat","user":{"login":"mattfarina","id":62991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfarina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfarina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-13T20:41:27Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T20:41:27Z","body":"@bschoenbach https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.11.0-rc.2 is out which fixes the regression.
