Just a tar file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n><> tar xzf chart.tar.gz\r\n\r\ngzip: stdin: not in gzip format\r\ntar: Child returned status 1\r\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\r\n```\r\n\r\n`tar xf chart.tar.gz` works fine.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this behaviour via the values file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/test-9027/demo ><> helm template .\r\n---\r\n# Source: demo/charts/subchart/templates/values.yaml\r\nglobal:\r\n  hash:\r\n    key1: 1\r\n    key2: 2\r\n    key3: 13\r\n    key4: 4\r\n    key5: 5\r\n    key6: 6\r\nhash:\r\n  key1: 1\r\n  key2: 2\r\n  key3: 13\r\n  key4: 4\r\n  key5: 5\r\n  key6: 6\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this can be worked around by setting a value via `--set` to `null`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/test-9027/demo ><> helm template . --set subchart.hash.key1=null,subchart.hash.key2=null\r\n---\r\n# Source: demo/charts/subchart/templates/values.yaml\r\nglobal:\r\n  hash:\r\n    key1: 1\r\n    key2: 2\r\n    key3: 13\r\n    key4: 4\r\n

parsed, whereas the `--set` parser can pick up these null values and propagate them down the tree as needed.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/728287931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bacongobbler","id":1360539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/bacongobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4002058930,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQwMDIwNTg5MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/events/4002058930","actor":{"login":"bacongobbler","id":1360539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/bacongobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bacongobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-16T19:53:17Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"e11d21"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/comments/728295701","html_url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/9027#issuecomment-728295701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/issues/9027","id":728295701,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODI5NTcwMQ==","user":{"login":"jkroepke","id":1560587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjA1ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1560587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke","html_url":"https://github.com/jkroepke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkroepke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-16T20:07:44Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T20:07:44Z","body":"Thanks

is a tiny change to prevent setting default resources for the Operator. Helm recommends not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious choice for the user.\r\n\r\nWe currently have two issues with default resources:\r\n1. Using CPU limits leads to unnecessary throttling - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577\r\n2. We can not unset the cpu limit key in a sub-chart due to a bug in Helm - https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/9027\r\n\r\nMost community helm charts do not set resources but provide guidance with some commented values instead. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts/issues/274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts/issues/274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"acondrat","id":7072575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzI1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7072575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat","html_url":"https://github.com/acondrat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acondrat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T11:27:26Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T11:27:26Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fluxcd-community/helm-charts/issues/80","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fluxcd-community/helm-charts","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fluxcd-community/helm-charts/issues/80/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fluxcd-community/helm-charts/issues/80/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fluxcd-community/helm-charts/issues/80/events","html_url":"https://github.com/fluxcd-community/helm-charts/pull/80","id":1147972074,"node_id":"PR_kwDOFQYT_c4zVoFm","number":80,"title":"Do
