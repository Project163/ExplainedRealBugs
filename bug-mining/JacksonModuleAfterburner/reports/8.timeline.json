Actually, it might not be that easy to see what is going on, as this appear to involve additional serializers from linked-to project. It would be good to have a stand-alone unit test that exhibits the problem only using classes declared in test class itself, to isolate the problem.\n\nThe challenge is that Afterburner does not change inclusion settings; and the code does check for inclusion.
