classes cause IllegalAccessError or SecurityException to be thrown when you try to generate classes that directly call into them.  While it is obviously better to fix the problem before it happens, the rules are complicated and not easy to ensure 100% compliance with.\n\nThis changes the behavior to fall back to the \"slow\" method when such an exception is caught.  This ensures that we do not cause fatal problems for users, but make it easy to continue using Afterburner and file bug reports to fix the problem \"when we can\".  The intention is that eventually we fix the code generation to not cause this problem in the first place.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-afterburner/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-afterburner/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
