\n\nRevert back was not processed on afterburner module. \n\nExemple on BooleanFieldPropertyWriter \n\n``` java\n    public BooleanFieldPropertyWriter(BeanPropertyWriter src, BeanPropertyAccessor acc, int index,\n            JsonSerializer<Object> ser) {\n        super(src, acc, index, ser);\n\n        if (MARKER_FOR_EMPTY == _suppressableValue) {\n            _suppressableBoolean = false;\n            _suppressableSet = true;\n        } else if (_suppressableValue instanceof Boolean) {\n           ...\n        }\n\n    public final void serializeAsElement(Object bean, JsonGenerator gen, SerializerProvider prov) throws Exception\n    { \n        ...\n        if (!_suppressableSet || _suppressableBoolean != value) {\n            gen.writeBoolean(value);\n        } else { \n           ...\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n6 classes must be update : \n- BooleanFieldPropertyWriter.java  \n- BooleanMethodPropertyWriter.java\n- IntFieldPropertyWriter.java\n- IntMethodPropertyWriter.java\n- LongFieldPropertyWriter.java\n- LongMethodPropertyWriter.java \n\nCould you correct this bug and release a patch ?\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-afterburner/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-afterburner/issues/63/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
