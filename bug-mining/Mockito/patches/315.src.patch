 ## How to release new version?
 
 1. Every change on the main development branch is released as `-SNAPSHOT` version to Sonatype snapshot repo
    at https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mockito/mockito-core.
-2. In order to release a non-snapshot version to Maven Central push an annotated tag, for example:
