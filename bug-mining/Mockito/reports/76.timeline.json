That would mean we go down on our `PATCH` number which might confuses people. For the Mockito 3.0 beta is to set the version to `3.0.0-beta.BETAVERSION` to not confuse with the `PATCH` number, but it still leaves us with the question regarding the official release of Mockito 2.0 :cry: \n\nCloses #123 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/483/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/242117600","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/594#issuecomment-242117600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/594","id":242117600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjExNzYwMA==","user":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T15:57:23Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T15:57:23Z","body":"@bric3, this is great.

This is really nice pushing forward for continuous delivery however I don't agree that every single commit should be released especially on libraries. For some projects it maybe ok, but for some I'd be more conservative.\n\nFor example 1.10.x series was nice but felt less stable to many users. Some merged PR introduced the Mockito rule and the API had to be changed. Some incorrect behavior had to be fixed, some were fixed later in the beta. I'm not sure this builds trust in the library.\n\nAlso with this big changes cannot fit in your model : should we have released in between PR of the JUnit feature, after all there was enough interesting and working features already. \nFor mockito 3 we will target java 8, there's a lot of clean up, maybe some rewriting, doing so we may break things, that happens even with tests, this phase should not be seen as something else than a beta.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/244230281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":775859771,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Nzc1ODU5Nzcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/775859771","actor":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-01T22:19:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":775859772,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc3NTg1OTc3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/775859772","actor":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-01T22:19:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/244231136","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/594#issuecomment-244231136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/594","id":244231136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDIzMTEzNg==","user":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-01T22:23:58Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T22:23:58Z","body":">
