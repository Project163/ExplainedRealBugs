However, this has now broken our coverage computation because of a breaking change in Gradle 4.10: https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/6419\r\n\r\nThere is no guidance from the Gradle team on how to migrate to a proper configuration. I have spend a couple of hours today to try to fix it, with no result. The TLDR is that Gradle now throws away the `test.exec` after executing the tests in a subproject. Thus, it will only have the coverage from the last subproject it ran.\r\n\r\nI have looked online and there are other projects that do something similar (https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/all/build.gradle, https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/blob/master/gradle/jacoco/jacoco.gradle) but none of the approaches worked for us.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
