not include static mocks in regular listener logic as it might distort existing mock collectors that do not expect scoped mocks. Fixes #1988.\r\n\r\nWe have passed `Class` objects to the listener to indicate a static mock. The class object is of course itself not a regular mock and it's cleaner to create a callback method of it's own. This way, existing listeners remain logically backwards compatible, including our own listener that is used within the JUnit runner (we have only tested the rule, I added a test for the runner, too).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1989/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3593241658,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1OTMyNDE2NTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/3593241658","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"db51229d939d49769046492dcc90a8e78dc3b00e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/commits/db51229d939d49769046492dcc90a8e78dc3b00e","created_at":"2020-07-28T08:29:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3593255043,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1OTMyNTUwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/3593255043","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"724619b544096a5bdf488053865f5cccdba2fda1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/commits/724619b544096a5bdf488053865f5cccdba2fda1","created_at":"2020-07-28T08:33:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3599579600,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzU5OTU3OTYwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/3599579600","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-29T15:22:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dependabot-preview[bot]","id":27856297,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjc4NTYyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/2141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot-preview","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_
