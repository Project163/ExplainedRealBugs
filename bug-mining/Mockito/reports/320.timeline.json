the Thales [JCPROV](https://thalesdocs.com/gphsm/luna/7/docs/network/Content/sdk/java/jcprov.htm) library which is unfortunately not available on Maven Central so I cannot compose a reproducer.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can describe its characteristics:\r\n\r\n* Public, top level and non-final\r\n* With a default constructor that is private and does nothing\r\n* With public methods that are all static and native\r\n* With a static initialization block that loads a native library via `System.loadLibrary`\r\n\r\nAs the native library is not available during test execution (and I cannot make it available), I would guess that the failure in the static block triggers the exception above. However, I don't know how to prove it.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I could do to properly mock such a class? Otherwise, do you see any possible improvements in Mockito for these cases?\r\n\r\nPlease, let me know in case I could grab additional details to help the analysis.\r\n\r\nThe issue happens on Mockito 5.10.0 and OpenJDK
