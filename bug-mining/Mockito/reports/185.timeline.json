folks,\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs, Mockito should have switched to strict mocks by default since v4. I've been eagerly waiting for this release, but it seems the feature is not there.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, following the conversations here https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2460, https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1769 and https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1517 I conclude that this is not something that is going to happen?\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I would like to do something like `mockito.strict = true` and expect the whole project to be evaluated as such (the default value can stay false). There is no easy way to enable strict mocks across the entire project.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to get an official statement on the plans regarding this feature?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2532/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Jenson3210","id":25441280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDQxMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25441280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210","html_url":"https://github.com/Jenson3210","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jenson3210/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-29T14:26:02Z","updated_at":"2024-10-29T14:26:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/issues/622","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/issues/622/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/issues/622/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/issues/622/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/issues/622","id":2621425590,"node_id":"I_kwDOEZ7PQM6cP8e2","number":622,"title":"The
