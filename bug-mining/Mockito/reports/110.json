Currently we fail fast when multiple constructors are found matching provided arguments. However, Mockito could potentially do a better job identifying which constructor to use. Example scenario:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass A {}\r\nclass B extends A {}\r\nclass C extends B {}\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  Foo(A a) {};\r\n  Foo(B b) {};\r\n}\r\n\r\n//Below fails with current implementation:\r\nmock(Foo, withSettings().useConstructor(new A()));\r\nmock(Foo, withSettings().useConstructor(new B()));\r\n//However, we could make above work because the constructor argument are not really ambiguous\r\n\r\n//Example use case of ambiguous constructor that we can remain failing on\r\nmock(Foo, withSettings().useConstructor(new C()));\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nTo get started, see CreatingMocksWithConstructorTest class. Unless the code changes, the interesting test method is [this one](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2.x/src/test/java/org/mockitousage/constructor/CreatingMocksWithConstructorTest.java#L150).","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
