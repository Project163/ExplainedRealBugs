is a proposal for a basic test project to ensure that the Mockito artifacts can be consumed from an OSGi environment. For example, reverting the fix for #678 is caught with the following exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to install bundle: mockito-core-3.2.3.jar\r\n\tat org.mockito.osgitest.OsgiTest.setUp(OsgiTest.java:55)\r\n\t...

A regular JUnit4 `test` source set with a single class OsgiTest. Starts an OSGi framework, installs mockito-core, byte-buddy and objenesis bundles as well as two test bundles, and executes some simple Mockito test cases inside the OSGi framework.\r\n2. A source set `testBundle` that's built to an OSGi bundle using the `Bundle` task from the Bnd Gradle Plugin. Contains the test classes that run the Mockito test cases and thus depends on the Mockito bundle.\r\n3. A source set `otherBundle` that's also built to an OSGi bundle but with no other dependencies. Used for testing mocking of classes from other bundles.\r\n\r\nSome further technical details:\r\n\r\n- The `test` source set only has compile dependencies on the OSGi APIs and JUnit4, i.e. not on Mockito. The OSGi framework is created using the standard Framework API. At runtime Equinox is added as a dependency to supply an actual framework implementation, but the intention is that any framework implementation could be used.\r\n- The test cases are run by loading classes from the test bundle that all implement `Runnable`. This is to provide a simple bridge using a common JDK class. The reason for setting up such a bridge is that I want to drive the tests using a test runner that Gradle supports, for example to get good test reports, but the test bundles don't know anything about JUnit4 inside the OSGi framework. I didn't want to explore adding an OSGified version of JUnit into the mix at this point since that would also entail solving test discovery inside an OSGi framework.\r\n- The OSGi bundles are built using the [Bnd Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/blob/master/biz.aQute.bnd.gradle/README.md#gradle-plugin-for-workspace-builds) instead of the deprecated `osgi` plugin in Gradle. The reason is both future proofing, to not impede a migration to Gradle 6.0 in this new sub project, and that I believe it better mirrors how other projects would consume the Mockito artifacts. Further it paves the way for replacing the usage of the deprecated plugin for the creating the OSGi manifests in the root project.\r\n\r\nSince this is my first contribution I'll be happy to fix anything that goes against the grains.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
