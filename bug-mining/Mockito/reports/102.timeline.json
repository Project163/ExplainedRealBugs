@raphw ,\r\n\r\nI am from Apache Cassandra project where we want to use Mockito to mock static methods, I know this feature was introduced in Mockito 3.4.0, we had version 3.2.4 so I had to update

The exception I am getting all over again is this:\r\n\r\nDependency versions are:\r\n\r\nmockito-inline:3.7.7\r\nbytebuddy and bytebuddy-agent: 1.10.20\r\njunit 4.12\r\n\r\nI do not have any extension files etc, I just merely bumped versions, we had `mockito-core` but as I understand it mockito-inline already includes it so we do not depend on it explicitly.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions how to
