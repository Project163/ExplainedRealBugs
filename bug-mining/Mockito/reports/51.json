And now mocking works as it should. \n\nIs this a known issue? Just the way the JVM rolls?\n\nThis is using mockito 1.10.19.\n","closed_by":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
