I can use `MockitoExtension` and `@Mock` annotation and by default I get Strict Stubbing behaviour. However, if I use `Mockito.Mock(MyClass.class)` to create mock it seems Strictness is not enabled. Even if I stub unnecessary methods it is not giving any error. \r\n\r\nI know I can work around this by using MockitoExtension to create mocks using @Mock, but is there any way to enable Strict Stubbing while using `Mockito.mock(MyClass.class);`\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ProductServiceTest {\r\n\r\n    private ProductRepository productRepository;\r\n    private ProductService productService;\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void setUp() {\r\n        productRepository = Mockito.mock(ProductRepository.class);\r\n        productService = new ProductService(productRepository);\r\n        // this is unnecessary method stubbing but it is not giving any error\r\n        Mockito.when(productRepository.findAllActiveProducts()).thenReturn(List.of());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void shouldReturnOnlyActiveProducts() {\r\n        BDDMockito.given(productRepository.findAll()).willReturn(List.of(p1, p2));\r\n        productService.findAll(); // which calls productRepository.findAll()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2648/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
