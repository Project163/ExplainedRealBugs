This includes:\r\n\r\n- `AtMost`\r\n- `Only`\r\n- `After`\r\n- `Timeout`\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue while using Mockito with a proprietary [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)-like library for JUnit. Here is a short example written with JUnit and the open-source runner [Oleaster](https://github.com/mscharhag/oleaster):\r\n\r\n```\r\n@RunWith(OleasterRunner.class)\r\npublic class DemoTest {\r\n\r\n    private MyClass myClass;\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        describe(\"demo\", () -> {\r\n\r\n            beforeEach(() -> {\r\n                myClass = Mockito.mock(MyClass.class);\r\n                myClass.myMethod();\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            verifyMyMethodCalled(atLeast(1));\r\n            verifyMyMethodCalled(atMost(1));\r\n            verifyMyMethodCalled(only());\r\n            verifyMyMethodCalled(after(1));\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void verifyMyMethodCalled(VerificationMode verificationMode) {\r\n        it(String.format(\"should call myMethod. %s\", verificationMode), () -> {\r\n            verify(myClass, verificationMode).myMethod();\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExtracting the assertion and the test-naming part to a specific method (`verifyMyMethodCalled(VerificationMode verificationMode)`) saves a lot of boilerplate and helps with maintainability, especially since a real-life test class will most likely be longer than this example. However, the following screenshot shows why the last 3 verificationModes aren't so helpful without a proper `toString()` method:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22927506/131226758-72a58f27-c1fb-44e2-8db2-70ab5476c7f5.png)\r\n\r\nI fixed this, in my use case, this by extending the offending `VerificationMode` in a custom factory method:\r\n```\r\nprivate static VerificationMode atMost(int times) {\r\n    return new AtMost(times) {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void verify(VerificationData data) {\r\n            super.verify(data);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public String toString() {\r\n            return \"Wanted invocations count: at most \" + times;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis quickly becomes cumbersome however, if you want to do it for multiple `VerificationMode`s or in multiple projects. Since most user-facing `VerificationMode`s already have a `toString()` method (e.g. `atLeast` in my example), the missing `toString()` methods could be included in Mockito.\r\n\r\nI have a PR that is almost ready for this, and would gladly submit it.\r\n\r\nEDIT: added `Timeout` to the list.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
