Examples include disallowing the usages of Mockito internals or extending interfaces annotated by `@NotExtensible`.\r\n\r\nThese plugins are beneficial to the Java community and we would like to open source them to the project. The extra subproject would contain several checkers (and tests) that implement several safeguards. Users can add the checkers to their project to their benefit.\r\n\r\nFor example for Gradle, the configuration would be as follows (using https://github.com/tbroyer/gradle-errorprone-plugin#custom-error-prone-checks):\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\ndependencies {\r\n  errorprone(\"org.mockito:mockito-errorprone:$mockitoVersion\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to make issues like #1616 and #1613 compiler errors rather than runtime failures.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1668/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1668/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
