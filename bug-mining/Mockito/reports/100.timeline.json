Problem\r\n\r\nCurrent release notes contain too much detail (full explanation: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/941). This is also important for Continuous Delivery Pipeline 2.0 (https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/911) because the release notes need to discriminate between notable and minor releases.\r\n\r\nIdeal solution would be a service that shows release notes between arbitrary versions and allows zooming in / out. Given that ideal solution does not exist now and it is costly to implement lets implement something simple.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nLet's add capability to generate a concise release notes report, only for noteworthy versions, including only noteworthy issues/pull requests.
