It appears to be that `thenThrow(Class)` instantiates the Throwable when it is called rather than instantiating it upon mock interaction.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nTo why this leads to the behaviour described in the issue is that the Throwable is passed to `thenThrow(Throwable)` which instantiates a custom Answer with `new ThrowsException(throwable)` and passes into `thenAnswer(Answer)`. This Answer, of course, stores the Throwable and throws it with every repeat mock interaction.\r\n\r\nBefore the merge, `thenThrow(Class)` used to call `thenAnswer(Answer)` directly with its own custom Answer, ThrowsExceptionClass. This Answer instantiated the Exception with each mock interaction.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution\r\nMy suggestion is to introduce an Answer similar to ThrowsExceptionClass described above (or a modified version of ThrowsException) and have `thenThrow(Class)` create that and call `thenAnswer(Answer)`.\r\n\r\nI can think of two ways to implement the suggestion. Both ways involve storing the Class\\<Throwable\\> and using Objenesis to instantiate the Throwable in the new Answer class, however:\r\n\r\n1. Create the new Answer class with similar code to ThrowsException but instead of throwing the stored Throwable it uses a new instance based of the stored Class\\<Throwable\\>.\r\n2. Modify ThrowsException to use a protected getter method for the Throwable. Then extend ThrowsException with the new Answer for Class\\<Throwable\\> which overrides the getter method to instantiate a new Throwable.\r\n\r\nOption 1 doesn't modify existing behaviour that works but has more duplicate code. Option 2 offers less duplicate code but modifies existing behaviour that works.\r\n\r\nI prefer option 2.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/600251938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dean-burdaky","id":24606160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjA2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24606160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky","html_url":"https://github.com/dean-burdaky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dean-burdaky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/600326905","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1875#issuecomment-600326905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1875","id":600326905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDMyNjkwNQ==","user":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-17T22:16:13Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T22:16:13Z","body":"Happy to review a PR for this.
