This also reveal that Mockito is not anymore compatible with JUnit 3.x.\n\nShould JUnit 3 still be supported? If yes, the \"silent\" support of JUnit exceptions (handled by the `JUnitTool`) becomes more complicated due to the different class hierarchy of JUnit's `ComparisonFailure`. More precisely, it would not be possible anymore to work with `java.lang.AssertionError`. For example, `VerificationOverTimeImpl` would have to work with `java.lang.Error` or some common error interface if JUnit 3 was supported.\n\nAnother question: Is the class `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent` intended to be used by clients of the Mockito library? If not I suggest to move it right next to the `JUnitTool` and reduce it's visibility to default. If Mockito should not have a dependency to JUnit, this class must not be used anywhere directly.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/68596288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ferstl","id":1487727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODc3Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1487727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl","html_url":"https://github.com/ferstl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferstl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/68596789","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/152#issuecomment-68596789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/152","id":68596789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NTk2Nzg5","user":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-03T14:38:55Z","updated_at":"2015-01-03T14:38:55Z","body":"@ferstl You are correct, the assignment is the issue here for the JUnit 3.x compatibility.
