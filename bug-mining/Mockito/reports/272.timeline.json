#2836\r\nfixes: #1593\r\nfixes: #585\r\n\r\nRemove broken `VarargMatcher` internal interface.\r\n\r\n## `any()` behaviour change\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: The behaviour of `any()` when passed to a varargs parameter has changed.  Prior to Mockito v5, the `any()` matcher would match each element in the varargs parameter, matching any number of elements 0...n. From Mockito v5 onwards `any()`, when passed to a varargs parameter, will match invocations where a single value is passed to the varargs parameter. To match any number of values passed to the varargs parameter, pass the type of the varargs parameter to `any()`. For example, given a `String...` varargs parameter, use `any(String[].class)`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString varargsMethod(String... arg);\r\n\r\nwhen(mock.varargsMethod(any()).thenReturn(\"matched!\");\r\n\r\n// Mockito 4.x.x: the following would match invocations with _any number_ of values passed to arg:\r\n// i.e. all of the following invocations will return \"matched!\":\r\nmock.varargsMethod();\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\");\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\", \"2\");\r\n\r\n// Mockito 5.x.x: now a single `any()` will match a single value passed to varargs parameter:\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\");\r\n\r\n// To match any number of values passed to varargs parameter use `any(String[].class):\r\nwhen(mock.varargsMethod(any(String[].class)).thenReturn(\"varargs!\");\r\n\r\n// then all of the following invocations will return \"varargs!\":\r\nmock.varargsMethod();\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\");\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\", \"2\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `ArgumentCaptor.forClass()` behaviour change\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: The behaviour of argument captors when passed to a varargs parameter has changed. Prior to Mockito v5, passing an argument captor to a varargs parameter would capture any number of values passed to the varargs parameter. From Mockito v5 onwards, the same call will match only a single value passed to the varargs parameter.  To capture any number of values, change to the type of the argument captor to match the array type of the varargs parameter. For example, given a `String...` varargs parameter, change the argument captor from type `String` to type `String[]`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString varargsMethod(String... arg);\r\n\r\n@Captor private ArgumentCaptor<String> captor;\r\n\r\nverify(mock).varargs(captor.capture());\r\n\r\n// Mockito 4.x.x: the above captor call would match all of the following invocations:\r\nmock.varargsMethod();    // captor.getAllValues() would return List.of();\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\");    // captor.getAllValues() would return List.of(\"1\");\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\", \"2\");     // captor.getAllValues() would return List.of(\"1\", \"2\");\r\n\r\n// After all invocations  captor.getAllValues() would return List.of(\"1\", \"1\", \"2\");\r\n\r\n// Mockito 5.x.x: the avove captor call would only match:\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\");    // captor.getAllValues() would return List.of(\"1\");\r\n\r\n// To match any number of values passed to the varargs parameter use `ArgumentCaptor<String[]>`:\r\n@Captor private ArgumentCaptor<String[]> captor;\r\n\r\n// Which will then match all of the following invocations:\r\nmock.varargsMethod();    // captor.getValue() would return List.of();\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\");    // captor.getValue() would return List.of(\"1\");\r\nmock.varargsMethod(\"1\", \"2\");     // captor.getValue() would return List.of(\"1\", \"2\");\r\n\r\n// After all invocations  captor.getAllValues() would return List.of({}, {\"1\"}, {\"1\", \"2\"});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `argThat()` behaviour change\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: The behaviour of all methods in `MockitoHamcrest`, such as `argThat()`, when passed to a varargs parameter has changed. Prior to Mockito v5, these matchers would match each element in the varargs parameter, matching any number of elements 0...n. From Mockito v5 onwards these matchers, when passed to a varargs parameter, will match invocations where a single value is passed to the varargs parameter. To match any number of values passed to the varargs parameter, pass use suitable Hamcrest Matcher and the varargs array type to `argThat`. For example, given a `String...` varargs parameter, use: `argThat(isA(String[].class), String[].class)`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n - [x] PR should be motivated, i.e. what does it fix, why, and if relevant how\r\n - [x] If possible / relevant include an example in the description, that could help all readers\r\n       including project members to get a better picture of the change\r\n - [x] Avoid other runtime dependencies\r\n - [x] Meaningful commit history ;
