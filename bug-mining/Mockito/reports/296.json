The documentation in the most recent version states:\r\n\r\n>  Smart Mockito users hardly use this feature because they know it could be a sign of poor tests.\r\n\r\nAt the core, I totally agree, this shouldn't be necessary. Nevertheless, the first sentence of the comment feels rather rude / condescending. I suggest a rephrase to something like\r\n\r\n> Using this method could be a sign of poor tests. \\<rest of the doc here\\>\r\n\r\nWould help with that.\r\n\r\nSee the following link: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/main/src/main/java/org/mockito/Mockito.java#L2581\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
