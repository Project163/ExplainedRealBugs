In the stack trace, it's clear that the line it's complaining about is line 24, in the static initializer for `ExceptionFactory`, when the factory implementation is actually created:\r\n\r\nat org.mockito.internal.junit.ExceptionFactory.<clinit>(ExceptionFactory.java:24)\r\n\r\nI expect a `ClassNotFoundError` to get thrown here when OpenTest4J is not on the class path. What is not expected is that this isn't caught by the surrounding `catch(Throwable)` statement. Which is why I think the android test framework is doing something funky.\r\n\r\nIf what you're suggesting were true, I'd expect line 27 to appear at the top of the stack trace, but it doesn't appear at all. According to the stack trace, it is failing before `create()` is even called, This scenario would also be contrary to the JVM spec (which, from memory, specifies that all the class's linkages should be resolved when the class is loaded, and not when a method is executed).\r\n\r\nOne way to test this would be to package up a JUnit test and deploy it as an APK into the emulator and run it directly, rather than as part of an instrumentation test.
