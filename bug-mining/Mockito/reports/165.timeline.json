API (for rationale, see #769):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n//Existing API:\r\n@Rule public MockitoRule mockito = MockitoJUnit.rule()\r\n\r\n//Proposed improvements:\r\nrule().strictness(Strictness.LENIENT)\r\nrule().strictness(Strictness.WARN)       // <-- is the default\r\nrule().strictness(Strictness.STRICT_STUBS)  // <-- Mockito 3.0 default\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat \"strict stubbing\" means?\r\n- Improved debuggability: the test fails early when code under test invokes stubbed method with different arguments.\r\n- Cleaner tests without unnecessary stubbings: the test fails when there are any unused stubs declared.\r\n- Cleaner, more DRY tests (\"Don't Repeat Yourself\"): If you use Mockito.verifyNoMoreInteractions() you no longer need to explicitly verify stubbed invocations. They are automatically verified.\r\n\r\nFor background and motivation, check out [Szczepan's article on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/curious-how-get-even-cleaner-tests-new-mockito-features-faber).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/770/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/265473041","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/793#issuecomment-265473041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/793","id":265473041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTQ3MzA0MQ==","user":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-07T15:14:09Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T15:15:04Z","body":"If exposed publicly the API should use an event object.

new public API based on an internal API - StubbingLookupListener - #793.\r\n\r\nAs a rule of a thumb we try to expose the internal APIs that the top level features are built upon. Since StubbingLookupListener is useful for us to implement strictness, let's get the former exposed as public API. This way we build stronger framework with the concept of \"onion skin API\".\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces #1466 - very nice PR from @marchpig.
