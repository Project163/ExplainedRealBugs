`Only.verify` throws `NullPointerException` with the latest `mockito-core` 5.9.0\r\n\r\nHere is a sample code in Kotlin which triggers this issue.\r\n```kotlin\r\nverify(service, only()).doSomething()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt triggers the following `NullPointerException` to be thrown.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"org.mockito.invocation.Invocation.getMock()\" because \"undesired\" is null\r\n\tat org.mockito.internal.exceptions.Reporter.noMoreInteractionsWanted(Reporter.java:555)\r\n\tat org.mockito.internal.verification.Only.verify(Only.java:30)\r\n\tat org.mockito.internal.verification.MockAwareVerificationMode.verify(MockAwareVerificationMode.java:30)\r\n\tat org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl.handle(MockHandlerImpl.java:75)\r\n\tat org.mockito.internal.handler.NullResultGuardian.handle(NullResultGuardian.java:29)\r\n\tat org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler.handle(InvocationNotifierHandler.java:34)\r\n\tat org.mockito.internal.creation.bytebuddy.MockMethodInterceptor.doIntercept(MockMethodInterceptor.java:82)\r\n\tat org.mockito.internal.creation.bytebuddy.MockMethodAdvice.handle(MockMethodAdvice.java:134)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA quick analysis shows that it is caused by method `Only.verify` which searches for an optional unverified invocation by execution of method `InvocationsFinder.findFirstUnverified`, but then fails to check for the result for `null` and just calls method `Reporter.noMoreInteractionsWanted` which throws the exception because the invocation was not found.\r\nhttps://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/main/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/verification/Only.java#L29C37-L30\r\n```java\r\n        MatchableInvocation target = data.getTarget();\r\n        List<Invocation> invocations = data.getAllInvocations();\r\n        List<Invocation> chunk = findInvocations(invocations, target);\r\n        if (invocations.size() != 1 && !chunk.isEmpty()) {\r\n            Invocation unverified = findFirstUnverified(invocations);\r\n            throw noMoreInteractionsWanted(unverified, (List) invocations);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that there is method `NoMoreInteractions.verify` which also makes a call to the same two methods `InvocationsFinder.findFirstUnverified` and `Reporter.noMoreInteractionsWanted` but it does so properly, thus the exception can not be thrown there.\r\nhttps://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/main/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/verification/NoMoreInteractions.java#L25-L28\r\n```java\r\n        Invocation unverified = findFirstUnverified(data.getAllInvocations());\r\n        if (unverified != null) {\r\n            throw noMoreInteractionsWanted(unverified, (List) data.getAllInvocations());\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I suggest that the same check for null would be made in method `Only.verify` to avoid the exception.\r\nAnd I also suggest that static analysis based on annotations would be introduced, then it would be obvious that method `findFirstUnverified` returns a nullable value while method `noMoreInteractionsWanted` does not accept a nullable argument.\r\n\r\n - [x] The mockito message in the stacktrace have useful information, but it didn't help\r\n - [x] The problematic code (if that's possible) is copied here;\r\n       Note that some configuration are impossible to mock via Mockito\r\n - [x] Provide versions (mockito / jdk / os / any other relevant information)\r\n - [x] Provide a [Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example](http://sscce.org) of the
