 I tried to fix this but eventually I came across an issue that if you have RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS, why would you expect an Optional to be not a mock? If it wouldn't be you would make some users quite surprised.\r\n\r\nHaving List.isEmpty = false is a happy coincidence, because it is a mock and not a `Collection.emptyList` nor `List.of()`.\r\n\r\nIn case of Optional, you get one that is not `Optional.empty()`, but gives you `false` when you ask for `Optional.isPresent`, the only issue is that it also returns `false` when you ask `Optional.isEmpty` - but this is normal mock behavior, defaults are set to `false` for
