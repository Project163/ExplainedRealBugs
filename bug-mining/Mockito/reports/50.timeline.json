#365 added a new method, `getArgument`, to `InvocationOnMock`, and deprecated `getArgumentAt`, but the new docs do not mention the version at which the new method was added and from what version the deprecation is in effect. This is confusing for users who are still using the 1.10.x series when using the Javadocs on the mockito.org website (which just shows the latest docs).\n\nA quick update to the docs in `InvocationOnMock` will solve this.

would like to mention that sometimes class argument can be useful.\r\n\r\nIn my case I would like to catch object passed to mock and write to mongo database.\r\nThe code I would like to have is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// test setup\r\ndoAnswer(invocation -> mongoTemplate.insert(invocation.getArgument(0, Person.class)))\r\n  .when(mock)\r\n  .myMethod(any());\r\n\r\n// test execution \r\nmock.myMethod(new Person(\"Joe\", \"Doe\"))\r\n```\r\nThe reason of problem is that `MongoTemplate` has 2 similar methods:\r\n```\r\npublic <T> ExecutableInsert<T> insert(Class<T> domainType) {...) //(1)\r\npublic void insert(Object objectToSave) {..) //(2)\r\n```\r\nAFAIU, when I setup `doAnswer(invocation -> mongoTemplate.insert(invocation.getArgument(0))`, type inference will choose method (1) and finally I get class cast exception `Person` -> `Class`\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, code `doAnswer(invocation -> mongoTemplate.insert((Person)invocation.getArgument(0))` does not compile\r\n\r\nTo implement my test, I have to define anonymous class `Answer` so my code is long-winded - one-liner looks much better\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/378266717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"michaldo","id":4304236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDQyMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4304236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo","html_url":"https://github.com/michaldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-05T16:53:30Z","updated_at":"2019-02-05T16:53:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1609","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1609/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1609/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1609/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1609","id":406877822,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDY4Nzc4MjI=","number":1609,"title":"Add
