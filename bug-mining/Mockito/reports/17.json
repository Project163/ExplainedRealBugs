I.e. the expression `ArgumentCaptor.fromClass(Class<S>)` should be of type `ArgumentCaptor<U>` where `S` is a subtype of `U`.   \n\nFor example:\n\n```\nArgumentCaptor<Consumer<String>> captor = ArgumentCaptor.fromClass(Consumer.class)\n```\n\ndoes not type check (i.e. it is a compile time error). It should type check. \n\nThe reasons that it is desirable for `ArgumentCaptor.fromClass` to allow expressions such as the example above to type check are:\n\n1) `ArgumentCaptor.fromClass` is intended to be a convenience method to allow the user to construct an ArgumentCaptor without casting the returned value.\n\nCurrently, the user can devise a workaround such as: \n\n```\nArgumentCaptor<? extends Consumer<String>> captor \n= ArgumentCaptor.fromClass(Consumer.class)\n```\n\nThis workaround is inconvenient, and so contrary to `ArgumentCaptor.fromClass` being a convenience method.\n\n2) It is inconsistent with `@Captor`, which can be applied to a field with a paramterized type.  I.e.\n\n```\n@Captor ArgumentCaptor<Consumer<String>> captor \n```\n\ntype checks.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
