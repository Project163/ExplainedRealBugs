Both are essentially the same with a small difference being the `DoesNotWork` class does fail and extends and empty class.\r\n\r\n### DoesNotWork.java:\r\n```\r\n@ExtendWith({MockitoExtension.class})\r\npublic class DoesNotWork extends ToBeExtended{\r\n    @Mock\r\n    ToBeMocked toBeMocked;\r\n    @InjectMocks\r\n    ToBeInitialized toBeInitialized;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void foo(){\r\n        assert toBeInitialized.toBeMocked == null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### ToBeInitialized.java:\r\n```\r\npublic class ToBeInitialized {\r\n    public ToBeMocked toBeMocked;\r\n\r\n    public ToBeInitialized(ToBeMocked toBeMocked) {\r\n        this.toBeMocked = null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nReading the docs that should work flawlessly. But it does not. As can be seen in `Works.java` the reason is the ` extends ToBeExtended` if you remove it everything works.\r\n\r\n### Why does it not work\r\n\r\nIn the  `DoesNotWork` the `@InjectMocks` annotated instances are initialized twice. It does it twice, one time more for every super class there is. First the `@InjectMocks` annotated instances are initialized via constructor injection. In a second round Mockito realizes that DoesNotWork.toBeInitialized is already initialized and therefore chooses Field injection over constructor injection. That makes sense if somebody does something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    @InjectMocks\r\n    Foo foo= new Foo();\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The code responsible\r\nInjectingAnnotationEngine::processInjectMocks https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/caf35b24e2764df0498469526ecb3e7ec68a0430/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/configuration/InjectingAnnotationEngine.java#L56\r\n\r\nThe method is called by the MockitoExtension:\r\n```\r\nprocessInjectMocks:61, InjectingAnnotationEngine (org.mockito.internal.configuration)\r\nprocess:48, InjectingAnnotationEngine (org.mockito.internal.configuration)\r\nopenMocks:82, MockitoAnnotations (org.mockito)\r\n<init>:43, DefaultMockitoSession (org.mockito.internal.framework)\r\nstartMocking:83, DefaultMockitoSessionBuilder (org.mockito.internal.session)\r\nbeforeEach:153, MockitoExtension (org.mockito.junit.jupiter)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n    private List<AutoCloseable> processInjectMocks(\r\n            final Class<?> clazz, final Object testInstance) {\r\n        List<AutoCloseable> closeables = new ArrayList<>();\r\n        Class<?> classContext = clazz;\r\n        while (classContext != Object.class) {\r\n            closeables.add(injectCloseableMocks(testInstance));\r\n            classContext = classContext.getSuperclass();\r\n        }\r\n        return closeables;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIn this method for every super class the Test class has(`classContext.getSuperclass()`) it triggers the injection(` injectCloseableMocks`) yet another time(`while (classContext != Object.class)`). That might be clever if the super class has  `@InjectMocks` annotated instances its-self. But it is odd to call `closeables.add(injectCloseableMocks(testInstance));` instead of `closeables.add(injectCloseableMocks(classContext));` then. For me it would make more sense to call it on the super class then instead of repeating the initialization yet another time. But I have not tested this change. I can not foresee what implications this would have. Fixing this concrete bug is probably better of in the hands of somebody that is more familiar with Mockito's internal workings. \r\n\r\n## Why even care about this bug\r\nSeems like it still initializes the instance right? Who does \r\n```\r\npublic ToBeInitialized(ToBeMocked toBeMocked) {\r\n    this.toBeMocked = null;\r\n }\r\n``` \r\nanyways?\r\n\r\nSince newer Java versions get stricter in enforcing reflections over module borders this will increasingly become an issue. In my case Mockito does access a field via reflections it is not allowed to making it fail. But it should never have tried field injection since the class had a working constructor. Due to the bug that is descripted here it did nevertheless.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Versions:\r\nJDK 17, Windows 11, Mockito Version 4.4.0 (Even though this all should be reproducible elsewhere and with different versions)\r\n\r\nThank you for working on Mockito. Great Framework ❤️ \r\nAny more questions? I am happy to help.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2602/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2602/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
