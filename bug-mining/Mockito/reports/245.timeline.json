figured that there is a number of byte-buddy artifacts, so it might be useful to provide a BOM (Bill Of Materials) that lists all versions of all artifacts in a central place.\r\n \r\nSuch a thing could then be consumed in a Maven multi project build through\r\n \r\n```\r\n<dependencyManagement>\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>net.bytebuddy</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>byte-buddy-bom</artifactId>\r\n        <version>${byte-buddy.version}</version>\r\n        <type>pom</type>\r\n        <scope>import</scope>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n    [...]\r\n</dependencyManagement>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this could be referenced in individual module files like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependencies>\r\n    <dependency>\r\n      <groupId>net.bytebuddy</groupId>\r\n      <artifactId>byte-buddy</artifactId>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>net.bytebuddy</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>byte-buddy-agent</artifactId>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n    [...]\r\n</dependencies>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n* [Mockito

figured that there is a number of xmlunit artifacts, so it might be useful to provide a BOM (Bill Of Materials) that lists all versions of all artifacts in a central place.\r\n \r\nSuch a thing could then be consumed in a Maven multi project build through\r\n \r\n```\r\n<dependencyManagement>\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>org.xmlunit</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>xmlunit-bom</artifactId>\r\n        <version>${xmlunit.version}</version>\r\n        <type>pom</type>\r\n        <scope>import</scope>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n    [...]\r\n</dependencyManagement>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this could be referenced in individual module files like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependencies>\r\n    <dependency>\r\n      <groupId>org.xmlunit</groupId>\r\n      <artifactId>xmlunit-core</artifactId>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>org.xmlunit</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>xmlunit-matchers</artifactId>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n    [...]\r\n</dependencies>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n* [Mockito

BOM](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/fasterxml/jackson/jackson-bom/2.13.3/jackson-bom-2.13.3.pom)\r\n* [JUnit Jupiter

BOM](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-bom/2.17.2/log4j-bom-2.17.2.pom)\r\n* [Byte Buddy
