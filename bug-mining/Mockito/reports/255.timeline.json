That's why we disable it at test level for the groovy tests (https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/ff7b8ee1d798d38c857faae90b158237981a793a).

https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2656\r\n\r\nRelease 4.6.0 introduced a new feature https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2650 to allow strictness to be set via the `@Mock` annotation. Unfortunately, the feature has a bug that results in any test-level strictness setting being ignored, e.g. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ExtendWith(MockitorExtension.class)\r\n@MockitoSettings(strictness = Strictness.LENIENT)\r\nclass ThingTest {\r\n\r\n  @Mock\r\n  private Thing lenientMock;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above code the `lenientMock` would actually be strict, as the `@Mock`'s `strictness` defaults to `STRICT_STUBS`. This default was overriding the test level `LENIENT`.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue the default of the `Mock.strictness` method needs to be something meaning `not set`, allowing the mock's strictness to be ignored and the test level strictness to be used.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no `no set` value exists in the `Strictness` enum and it is illegal to default to `null`. Fixing this in a backwards compatible way would have meant polluting the public API, (e.g. adding a `DEFAULT` value to the existing `Strictness` enum, which doesn't make sense in a lot of other places the enum is used).  As this feature has only just been released, and is essentially broken, a breaking change is being introduced to fix the issue.  \r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: This PR changes the return value of `Mock.strictness()` to a local `Strictness` enum value.  This will require users to change any code written against 4.6.0 that sets the `strictness` via the `@Mock` annotation to change their code.\r\n\r\nExample code migration:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ThingTest {\r\n\r\n    @Mock(strictness = Strictness.LENIENT)\r\n    private Thing thing;\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ThingTest {\r\n\r\n    @Mock(strictness = Mock.Strictness.LENIENT)\r\n    private Thing thing;\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Read the [contributing
