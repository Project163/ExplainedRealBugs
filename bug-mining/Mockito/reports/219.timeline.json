issue just came up as we tried to upgrade from 3.3.3 to either 3.4.6 or 3.5.9. A large chunk of our unit tests became flaky as a result. Holding onto a strong reference of `MockitoAnnotations.openMocks()` does not seem to have any impact. The only thing that seemed to rectify the issue was creating and retaining a `MockitoSession` like via `MockitoJUnit.rule()` (Using the `MockspressoJUnitRunner` shows the same flakiness as no session is initialized in it). \r\n\r\nConsidering that `Mockito.mockitoSession()` is labeled as optional and `@Incubating`, and considering that the junit rule & TestRunner have always been optional historically, this seems like a legitimate bug that will block mockito upgrades in many large codebases (especially those relying on mockito-kotlin's inline `mock()` method).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/685976696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghackett","id":568930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett","html_url":"https://github.com/ghackett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghackett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/685981599","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1802#issuecomment-685981599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1802","id":685981599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NTk4MTU5OQ==","user":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-02T20:33:35Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T20:33:35Z","body":"Yes, this needs to be addressed.

Mockito.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/685981599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3726629492,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3MjY2Mjk0OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/3726629492","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"03afdaeda1cb9d5fb58fbec621d3ea12e5ee781c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/commits/03afdaeda1cb9d5fb58fbec621d3ea12e5ee781c","created_at":"2020-09-03T20:47:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-03T21:12:33Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T21:12:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2034","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2034/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2034/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2034/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2034","id":692366852,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDc4OTY5OTc5","number":2034,"title":"Escape
