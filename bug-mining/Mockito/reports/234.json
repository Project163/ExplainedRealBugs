I am trying to mock the return value as shown here:\r\n```kotlin\r\n`when`(useCase.getA()).thenReturn(Result.success(ObjectA(\"testName\")))\r\n```\r\nThe exception when trying to use that returned Result is this one: `java.lang.ClassCastException: kotlin.Result cannot be cast to ObjectA`\r\n\r\nAn interesting thing I found when debugging is that if I check the returned value of that `useCase.getA()` function, it returns an object with description `Success(Success(ObjectA(name=testName)))`. A regular Result returns this description `Success(ObjectA(name=name))`. I guess that's the reason it's failing, it seems there is like a nested Result object, so I am assuming there is something wrong with Mockito when handling the Kotlin Result class.\r\n\r\nThis is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/adrianhescalante/30449c876608fb7283e52c4d6acc5ad6)  I created to test it. There are two tests, one with the Kotlin Result and another one with a quick Result implementation (OwnResult) to check there is not something wrong I am doing myself.\r\n\r\nI am using Mockito 3.3.3 on an Android project with Java 8.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1930/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
