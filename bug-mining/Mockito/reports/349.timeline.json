Maybe we should add the non kts example to the docs?\r\n\r\n> apply from: due to strong typing. Could you be more explicit,\r\n\r\nWhen we build our multi-project / composition project with gradle, we do split our configuration into different pieces, so we\r\n\r\n- can share configuration templates between projects\r\n- the build.gradle does not look like a 1000 lines mess\r\n\r\ne.g. \r\n\r\n```groovy\r\n// common\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/../gradle/common_compile.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/../gradle/common_kotlin.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/../gradle/common_repositories.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/../gradle/common_dependencies.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/../gradle/common_publish.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/../gradle/common_tasks.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/../gradle/common_dependency_check.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/../gradle/common_dependencies_tests.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/../gradle/common_tests_config.gradle\"\r\n\r\n// project specific\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/gradle/compile.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/gradle/sonarqube.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/gradle/publish.gradle\"\r\napply from: \"$rootProject.projectDir/gradle/dependencies.gradle\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you do this with kts gradle, most or all of them will not work, since  e.g. `sonarqube.gradle` will need to resolve the `sonarqube` option\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nsonarqube {\r\n    properties {\r\n       ....\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich a simple \"include\" at an arbitrary position the kts compiler cannot guarantee - thus such things cannot compile.\r\n\r\nFor this to solve with kts based gradle, one will use company wide gradle-convention-plugins for the \"common\" stuff and the project wide convention plugins for the project. This is an effort, sure i is the better option in general - but it is nice to not being forced to go with the big guns.\r\n\r\nAgain, you do no need to sell kotlin to me, we are basically only doing kotlin here, but for the gradle part, while i love the strong-typing, it comes with the named limitations which are a heavy price to pay (for us).

Current Behavior\n\nWhen using a Java Platform to control dependencies, the constraints are not applied to Configurations marked `transitive = false`. If dependencies in these Configurations don't supply their own version, the dependency fails to resolve.\n\nOutput from running the `:subproject:dependencies` task in the linked reproducible example:\n\n```\n> Task :subproject:dependencies\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nProject ':subproject'\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nmyConfig\n+--- root project :\n\\--- org.slf4j:slf4j-api FAILED\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI believe the constraints should always be applied, allowing for all dependency versions to be centrally managed.\n\nI assume this is because the non-transitive setting also applies to `platform` & `enforcedPlatform` dependencies.\n\n### Context (optional)\n\nSome plugins, such as SpotBugs, allow for extensions to its behaviour using a non-transitive Configuration `spotbugsPlugins`.  ~Also, the guidance of applying the Mockito `javaagent` also suggests marking the Configuration in the same manner.~ EDIT: My mistake,  the guidance there is to mark the dependency non-transitive, not the Configuration.
