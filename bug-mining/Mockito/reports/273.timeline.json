following code works with Mockito 3.11.2 and JDK 8, 11 and 14, but *not* JDK 16 or 17 (couldn't verify 15, sorry).

It appears as though the spy has fields that are `null` that are not `null` in the spied-on instance (verified by inspecting in a debugger):\r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot invoke

think it would also be nice if you can disable the *inline mock maker* for specific mocks. I think it is good if users can switch to the inline mock maker as early as possible. However, sometimes existing code does not work due to some strange cases. For example, I encountered one case where the code did only work because final methods (including `equals` and `hashCode`) were not mocked. Allowing users to enable the inline mock maker by default but keeping the old one in specific cases for some time could simplify the migration.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can introduce something like
