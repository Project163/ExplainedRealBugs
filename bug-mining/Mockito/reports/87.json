of the principles of designing Mockito is \"opinionated features on top of unopinionated toolkit\". This ticket is an example of this promise. Opinionated feature: unused stubs detection - new feature of Mockito 2. Unopinionated toolkit: API to get stubbing information from a mock object - this very ticket.\n\nBuilding high level features on top of on top of low level public API makes the framework flexible and extensible for unidentified use cases and scenarios.\n\nNew MockingDetails.getStubbings() -> Collection<Stubbing> api provides information about the stubbings declared for given mock. We use this internally to implement #384, let's expose it for advanced users / framework integrators.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
