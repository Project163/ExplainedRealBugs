The reason that is probably happening is that Mockito first adds the mocked type (https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/6f9108b833323345bd926f10914224d3e0a11b80/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/creation/bytebuddy/SubclassBytecodeGenerator.java#L97) in this case `PackagePrivate` before adding the current classloader: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/6f9108b833323345bd926f10914224d3e0a11b80/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/creation/bytebuddy/SubclassBytecodeGenerator.java#L99\r\n\r\nSo it looks up the classloader for the mocked type, which is the old classloader. Then it looks up the current classloader (which you changed) and then determines that they don't match. Thus `localMock == false`.\r\n\r\nThis code landed as part of supporting Java 9+ modules: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/1582 It wouldn't surprise me if there is an edge case we are missing.\r\n\r\nSince the new classloader delegates to the former, I would have expected the classes to match and thus pass the checks, but they don't. Presumably because of the classloader equality check. Can we be lenient here and allow for child classloaders to be valid as well?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/843336246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/843560889","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2303#issuecomment-843560889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2303","id":843560889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MzU2MDg4OQ==","user":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-18T21:02:10Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T21:02:10Z","body":"The reason we fail is that a package-private type is not visible outside of its own class loader.

Since we verify that the classloader we define in is a parent of the context classloader, we shouldn't see any problems with serialization, right? Or at least no new problems, as the existing `MultipleParentsClassLoader` relies on `getParent()` to infer the delegation order.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/844352194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"charlesmunger","id":1119316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1119316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesmunger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmunger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-24T18:43:52Z","updated_at":"2021-05-24T18:43:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2304","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2304/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2304/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2304/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2304","id":896685221,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4OTY2ODUyMjE=","number":2304,"title":"cannot
