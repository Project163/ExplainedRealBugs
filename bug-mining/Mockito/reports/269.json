With 4.7.0, this now works correctly:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        doAnswer(answerVoid((VoidAnswer2<String, Object[]>)\r\n                logger::info\r\n        )).when(mock)\r\n                .info(any(), (Object[]) any());\r\n```\r\n\r\n_However_, if I try to use this form which is slightly more ergonomic:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        doAnswer( answerVoid( (VoidAnswer2<String, Object[]>)\r\n                logger::info\r\n        ) ).when( mock )\r\n                .info( any(), any( Object[].class ) );\r\n```\r\n\r\n...the mocking will fail to intercept these method calls. :thinking: No error when creating the mock, but it just won't detect the method calls as expected.\r\n\r\nI _presume_ this has again something to do with the varargs parsing. `javac` resolves those two calls to the correct/same `logger.info()` overload, so so far so good.\r\n\r\nDo you want me to create a separate issue/repro repo for this? I'm not even sure if it's something that can be (easily) fixed, I just happened to see it now while trying to \"clean up our code\"... :sweat_smile:\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @perlun in https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2664#issuecomment-1319816402_\r\n      ","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2796/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
