2.23.15.\r\n - [x] Provide a [Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example](http://sscce.org) of the issue\r\n    Please find attached [inject-spy.zip](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/files/2905749/inject-spy.zip).\r\n    execute `./gradlew check`\r\n- [x] Read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nWe are experiencing a regression behavior caused by fix of #1587 (Remove unnecessary loop from InjectingAnnotationEngine) which prevent us to update from Mockito 2.23.4 to newer versions.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class TestedServiceTest extends AbstractTest {\r\n\r\n    @InjectMocks\r\n    private TestedService testedService;\r\n\r\n    @InjectMocks\r\n    @Spy\r\n    private SpiedCompositionService spiedCompositionService;\r\n\r\n    @Mock\r\n    private MockedDao mockedDao;\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see in this snippet and example project attached, with Mockito 2.23.14 when we try to inject a mock in a spy and this spy in the tested object, it works as expected and everything is injected. But when we switch to Mockito 2.23.15, this behavior doesn't work anymore, the spy is not injected to tested object and obviously causes a NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nWe also figured out injection of injected spies was working only because test class extends has an abstract test class.\r\n\r\nI understand this test case is not a state of the art way to do unit test, our use case is more a component test because several classes work together to do a coherent unit of work and it makes more sense to test them together.\r\n\r\nWe are relying on the behavior provided up to Mockito 2.23.14 and the only workaround I see is to expose attributes to package visibility and do injection by hand.\r\n\r\nThe loop removed by #1587 was injecting injected spies newly instantiated by first loop. The depth of injection was relying on the depth of test hierarchy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2177441630,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxNzc0NDE2MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2177441630","actor":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-04T10:17:15Z","label":{"name":"injection","color":"a02031"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2742507522,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3NDI1MDc1MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2742507522","actor":{"login":"tokuhirom","id":21084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom","html_url":"https://github.com/tokuhirom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4f9578bb4b4723b8fd6c42bec61d5d4dea9c1020","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokuhirom/mockito/commits/4f9578bb4b4723b8fd6c42bec61d5d4dea9c1020","created_at":"2019-10-24T23:29:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2747071619,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3NDcwNzE2MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2747071619","actor":{"login":"tokuhirom","id":21084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom","html_url":"https://github.com/tokuhirom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokuhirom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a51ff5077fd5208e57b1c71e24856c68f82cf01b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokuhirom/mockito/commits/a51ff5077fd5208e57b1c71e24856c68f82cf01b","created_at":"2019-10-28T01:48:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2751622093,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3NTE2MjIwOTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2751622093","actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https
