Description\r\nMockito [v5.17.0](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v5.17.0) fixed a [bug](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3622) that required a workaround where our BucketTestExtension implemented BeforeTestExecutionCallback which skips tests after any BeforeEach operations are made. This adds time during skipped tests to perform these actions which were not needed. This change bumps the Mockito version resolving the bug and migrates BucketTestExtension to implement BeforeEachCallback.\r\n\r\n### Issues Resolved\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nRan GHA with `--rerun-tasks` before and after the change, the total CI duration took [19m 14s](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/actions/runs/14271632560/usage) before and [18m 27s](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/actions/runs/14272086734/usage) afterwards, a reduction of 47 seconds\r\n\r\n### Check List\r\n- [x] New functionality includes testing\r\n- [x] Public documentation issue/PR [created](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues/new/choose), if applicable.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I
