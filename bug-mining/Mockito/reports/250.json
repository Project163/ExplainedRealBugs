There's more information in #2759, but the gist of it is that Oracle removed the `element-list` URL and replaced it with the `package-list` URL. However, the latter can only be consumed by JavaDoc from JDK 9 and above, whereas we are running JDK 8 (since our minimum supported version is still Java 8).\r\n\r\nWe have a couple of options to remedy the situation:\r\n1. We upgrade to Java 11 and publish Mockito 5, as we update our minimum supported version\r\n2. We employ JUnit's workaround where we download the `package-list` and write it to disk as `element-list`, after which we use `-linkoffline` instead of `-link` to consume the file\r\n3. We use Java 11 to publish our JavaDoc, but we use Java 8 for the rest (e.g. artifact publication)\r\n4. We use Java 11, but we still publish with minimum version Java 8\r\n\r\nOf all these options, I think 2 is the best we have. Upgrading to Java 11 runtime (regardless of what version we decide to publish for) is still a risk, as we want our artifacts to work on Java 8. And the best way to confirm that's all working is to run on Java 8 ourselves. I don't think we should upgrade to Java 11 yet, but it's one more drop in the bucket for us dropping Java 8 support.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2765/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
