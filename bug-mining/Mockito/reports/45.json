For instance, consider having a mock `myMock1` that provides a function that returns a generic `T`. If `T` also has a function that returns a generic, an Exception with the message \"Raw extraction not supported for : 'null'\" will be thrown.\n\nAs an example the following test will throw an Exception:\n\n``` Java\npublic class MockitoGenericsDeepStubTest {\n\n    @Test\n    public void discoverDeepMockingOfGenerics() {\n        MyClass1 myMock1 = mock(MyClass1.class, RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS);\n\n        when(myMock1.getNested().getNested().returnSomething()).thenReturn(\"Hello World.\");\n    }\n\n    public static interface MyClass1 <MC2 extends MyClass2> {\n        public MC2 getNested();\n    }\n\n    public static interface MyClass2<MC3 extends MyClass3> {\n        public MC3 getNested();\n    }\n\n    public static interface MyClass3 {\n        public String returnSomething();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can make this test run if you step into the class `ReturnsDeepStubs` and change the method `withSettingsUsing` to return `MockSettings` with `ReturnsDeepStubs` instead of `ReturnsDeepStubsSerializationFallback` as default answer:\n\n``` Java\nprivate MockSettings withSettingsUsing(GenericMetadataSupport returnTypeGenericMetadata, MockCreationSettings parentMockSettings) {\n    MockSettings mockSettings = returnTypeGenericMetadata.hasRawExtraInterfaces() ?\n            withSettings().extraInterfaces(returnTypeGenericMetadata.rawExtraInterfaces())\n            : withSettings();\n\n    return propagateSerializationSettings(mockSettings, parentMockSettings)\n            .defaultAnswer(this);\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this breaks other tests and features.\n\nI think, the issue is that further generics are not possible to be mocked by `ReturnsDeepStubsSerializationFallback` since the `GenericMetadataSupport` is \"closed\" at this point.\n\nThanks and kind regards\nTobias\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
