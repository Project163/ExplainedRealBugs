JUnit provides the ErrorCollector @Rule to facilitate this kid of thing, but the current [ErrorCollector API](http://junit.org/apidocs/org/junit/rules/ErrorCollector.html) requires either\n- a Matcher<T> and a value to compare\n- or a Callable<Object>\n\nThe Mockito verify statements only return void, however, since they depend on throwing exceptions.  I have not thought of an ideal, non-disruptive way to use JUnit's ErrorCollector to aggregate multiple Mockito verify failure\n","closed_by":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/124/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
