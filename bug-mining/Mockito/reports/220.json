While correct, it seems like perhaps using the standard \"non-mock\" warning would be more helpful as it has better hinting for this situation.  In particular, this seems like it would be useful to newer users of the API who might have a hard time figuring out what they did wrong.\r\n\r\n## Mockito.verify\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<?> mock = Mockito.mock(List.class);\r\nMockito.verify(Mockito.mock.get(5));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Output\r\n\r\n```text\r\nArgument passed to verify() should be a mock but is null!\r\nExamples of correct verifications:\r\n    verify(mock).someMethod();\r\n    verify(mock, times(10)).someMethod();\r\n    verify(mock, atLeastOnce()).someMethod();\r\n    not: verify(mock.someMethod());\r\nAlso, if you use @Mock annotation don't miss initMocks()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## inOrder.verify\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<?> mock = Mockito.mock(List.class);\r\nInOrder inOrder = Mockito.inOrder(mock);\r\ninOrder.verify(mock.get(5));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Output\r\n\r\n```text\r\nInOrder can only verify mocks that were passed in during creation of InOrder.\r\nFor example:\r\n    InOrder inOrder = inOrder(mockOne);\r\n    inOrder.verify(mockOne).doStuff();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Desired behavior\r\n\r\nNote that the current `InOrder` message does not give the hint of how to fix the non-mock that was passed in.  Using the standard non-mock warning in this case seems like a more helpful response.  Alternatively, that the hinting could be included in the `InOrder` output when a non-mock is used.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
