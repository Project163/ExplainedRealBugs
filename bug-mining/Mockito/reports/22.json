This field is injected wrong, see screenshot.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1404810/7410003/4f200580-ef2b-11e4-9c39-7a699dc4fefa.png)\n\nFrom our quick testing, the name `txtNextView` doesn't matter, that can be changed. But both `txtGateView` and `txtGateLabel` messed things up. If we mock out both fields, it works correctly.\n\nTestproject: https://github.com/SimenB/emptyandroid\n\nI don't know if it's because it's Android, but it was easiest for me to create a minimal test from existing code.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
