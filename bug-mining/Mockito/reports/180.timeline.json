main difference between the current and the simple implementation above is, that the simple one inits the mocks in postProcessTestInstance() whereas the current one inits them in beforeEach(). Any ideas why that might be a problem? \r\n\r\nI tried the failing tests with a modified version of the current MockitoExtension which was just altered to init the mocks in postProcessTestInstance() and disabled the init in beforeEach() and the tests do no longer fail. So this seems to be the source of the problems.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/480444849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"markusheiden","id":1014626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQ2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1014626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden","html_url":"https://github.com/markusheiden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusheiden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/480462033","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1630#issuecomment-480462033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1630","id":480462033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDQ2MjAzMw==","user":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-06T01:12:28Z","updated_at":"2019-04-06T01:12:28Z","body":"Hey guys, can you provide us a test that reproduces the problem?

I.e., even if parallel execution mode is enabled by default, and a test class is annotated with `Lifecycle.PER_CLASS`, its tests will still be executed sequentially _unless_ it is also annotated with `@Execution(CONCURRENT)`: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution\r\n\r\nI also bumped into this issue in our codebase, with some tests using `MockitoExtension` failing in parallel mode, and some working fine.

JUnit 5 creates a single `ClassExtensionContext `for a multithreaded test, but each thread becomes an instance of the test class\r\n2. Each thread will come into `postProcessTestInstance `where they put their test instance in the same `ClassExtensionContext.getStore(MOCKITO)` map with the same key (`TEST_INSTANCE`)\r\n3. Each thread then will get into `beforeEach`. They get a thread unique `MethodExtensionContext`, but each of them contain the same instance of `ClassExtensionContext`. Then they fetch the the last updated `TEST_INSTANCE `from the parent `ClassExtensionContext `inside the `collectParentTestInstances `method. Each thread gets quasi a random Test Instance depending on the fact which thread was before inside the `postProcessTestInstance `method. Then they prepare their broken Session inside the store of the current `MethodExtensionContext `with a random Test Instance included.\r\n\r\nThat is the explanation. I am thinking about how to solve this.\r\n\r\nIt is not 100% clear to me why the parent context test instance is included.
