thanks @bric3 ! Let me take this chance to add that Mockito is an excellent piece of software and a near-perfect mocking library IMO - all of your efforts are highly appreciated :) I was at a workshop with Michael Feathers recently and was asking him whether he planned to update his book Working Effectively with Legacy Code to reflect the invent of modern (non-strict!) mocking frameworks such as Mockito as in my opinion they have revolutionized dependency-breaking and bringing legacy code under test. No luck, but maybe someone should write a new updated such book

#992: Backport MockitoV1CompatibilityMatcher from 2.x to aid in migration to 2.x\r\n\r\nThe 2.x version of ArgumentMatcher<T> differs quite\r\nsignificantly from the current version:\r\n1) It is an interface not a class and no longer extends\r\n   org.hamcrest.Matcher.\r\n2) Its main method is matches(T) not matches(Object).\r\n3) It uses the toString() method to construct a description and\r\n   not the describeTo(Description) method.\r\n\r\nThis class supports the following strategy for migrating\r\nimplementations of ArgumentMatcher from 1.10.19 to 2.x:\r\n1) First migrate to a 1.x version that has\r\n   MockitoV1CompatibilityMatcher change in it. That should be\r\n   relatively simple.\r\n2) Then modify all existing implementation of ArgumentMatcher\r\n   to extend MockitoV1CompatibilityMatcher.\r\n3) Switch to use a version of 2.x that contains this change.\r\n   Everything should compile as usual.\r\n4) Modify the classes that extend MockitoV1CompatibilityMatcher\r\n   to implement ArgumentMatcher interface directly.\r\n\r\nThe above strategy is overkill when migrating a small project\r\nthat can be updated atomically but it has proven to be a good\r\napproach when upgrading a large project spread across multiple\r\ngit repositories. This is added in part because of the\r\nexperience doing exactly that with the Android Open Source\r\nPlatform.\r\n\r\ncheck list\r\n\r\n - [x] Read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2.x/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n - [ x PR should be motivated, i.e. what does it fix, why, and if relevant how\r\n - [x] If possible / relevant include an example in the description, that could help all readers\r\n       including project members to get a better picture of the change\r\n - [x] Avoid other runtime dependencies\r\n - [x] Meaningful commit history ; intention is important please rebase your commit history so that each\r\n       commit is meaningful and help the people that will explore a change in 2 years\r\n - [x] The pull request follows coding style\r\n - [x] Mention `Fixes #<issue number>` in the description _if relevant_\r\n - [x] At least one commit should mention `Fixes #<issue number>` _if relevant_\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1015/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
