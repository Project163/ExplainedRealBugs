Kotlin creates several methods with equal Java signature. Given test test class:\r\n```java\r\nclass example.FunctionTest$testAgain$value$1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Kotlin compiler implements two methods:\r\n```java\r\njava.lang.Object example.FunctionTest$testAgain$value$1.invoke()\r\nvoid example.FunctionTest$testAgain$value$1.invoke()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the view of the Java language, these two methods have an identical invocation signature and Byte Buddy attempts to resolve one method as a bridge method of the other one what is not correct for the Kotlin language.\r\n\r\nI am currently trying to figure out why Kotlin is doing that, this would also break interoperability from Java. Unfortunately, this is not an easy mistake to work around either as we need to resolve bridge methods in order to handle Java classes correctly. And even with Kotlin, Java classes will always be involved via the core class library such that one cannot simply offer a language switch.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this broke recently is a result of fixing this resolution for Java which was necessary due to a bug in this
