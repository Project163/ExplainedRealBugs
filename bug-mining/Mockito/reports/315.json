Lazy configuration. `tasks.withType(Foo)` would be lazy if changed to `tasks.withType(Foo).configureEach`. This means a task shouldn't be configured unless it needs to be executed.\r\n2. `libraries.depname` could be migrated to a [version catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) and even have the variable name be libraries with the same access keys. I think most people are using `libs.versions.toml` but there is a dsl version\r\n3. switch many subproject testing to [jvm test suites](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jvm_test_suite_plugin.html). I think this will make it easier to understand for contributors what is a released jar vs what's simply a test suite. I also believe it will come with some performance improvements and code reduction due to not having to have another project. note: test is already a jvm test suite.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3384/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
