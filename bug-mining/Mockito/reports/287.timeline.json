also like the idea about removing this `return true` statement when I wrote something which is more \"assertion\" than \"matching\".\r\n\r\nBut it seems there is some limitation about this, see : [**`argThat` plus asserts**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57281503/5088764).\r\nNot sure to understand details, maybe a Mockito committer could explain this ?\r\n\r\nIdeally, I think it would be great if **Mockito** provide an elegant way to use **AssertJ** to match arguments and/or more generally provide a way to assert arguments instead of matching it.\r\n\r\nWaiting, you could implement your own : \r\n**The general way** (not dependent of AssertJ - source : https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/972#issuecomment-399988670)\r\n```java\r\npublic static <T> T assertArg(Consumer<T> assertion) {\r\n    return argThat(argument -> {\r\n        assertion.accept(argument);\r\n        return true;\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**The AssertJ oriented** (depend of AssertJ and unfortunately Hamcrest too...  - source : https://gist.github.com/superbob/091489c61ce9bd79d14a4d3d731c9c49?permalink_comment_id=3863242#gistcomment-3863242)\r\n```java\r\nimport org.assertj.core.matcher.AssertionMatcher;\r\nimport org.mockito.hamcrest.MockitoHamcrest;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.function.Consumer;\r\n\r\npublic class TestUtil {\r\n\r\n    public static <T> T assertArg(Consumer<T> assertions) {\r\n        return MockitoHamcrest.argThat(new AssertionMatcher<T>() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void assertion(T actual) throws AssertionError {\r\n                assertions.accept(actual);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI didn't dig to understand what is the benefits of AssertJ oriented solution compare to general way ...  maybe better miss match report ? :shrug: \r\nif the AssertJ oriented solution is better, I guess it should be great to have one without Hamcrest dependency.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/1424578981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbernard31","id":840294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDI5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/840294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31","html_url":"https://github.com/sbernard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"sbernard31","id":840294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDI5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/840294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31","html_url":"https://github.com/sbernard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbernard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-09T17:58:05Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T17:58:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-leshan/leshan/issues/1390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-leshan/leshan","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-leshan/leshan/issues/1390/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-leshan/leshan/issues/1390/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-leshan/leshan/issues/1390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-leshan/leshan/issues/1390","id":1558405836,"node_id":"I_kwDOAdAp1c5c42LM","number":1390,"title":"Considering

#2285\r\n\r\nEnables convenient alternative to `ArgumentCaptor` to assert arguments during verification:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nverify(otherServiceMock).doStuff(assertArg(param -> {\r\n    assertThat(param.getField1()).isEqualTo(\"value1\");\r\n    assertThat(param.getField2()).isEqualTo(\"value2\");\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerification succeeds as long as no exception is thrown from the lambda passed to `assertArg`, which means it works with any assertions (JUnit, AssertJ, ...).\r\n\r\nSince this is my first PR to Mockito, I may have missed something, or perhaps the documentation should be improved.

assertThat(param.getField1()).isEqualTo(\"value1\");\r\n    assertThat(param.getField2()).isEqualTo(\"value2\");\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is nice, I appreciate a lot, but my problem is, and this is *often overlooked*: we should report multiple failures at once (where assertions are independent of each other). To give a better example we can:\r\n\r\n* Use JUnit's `assertAll`\r\n* Use AssertJ's `assertSoftly`\r\n* Or use AssertJ's `tuple` and/or `extracting` (if lists are involved)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nverify(otherServiceMock).doStuff(assertArg(param -> {\r\n    assertThat(​tuple(param.getField1(), param.getField2())​)\r\n            .isEqualTo(​tuple(\"value1\", \"value2\"));\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr whatever code style you find more readable.\r\n\r\nSadly, several frameworks/libraries get it wrong as well:\r\n\r\n* REST Assured\r\n* Spring MockMvcTest before adding `andExpectAll` in Spring Framework v5.3.10\r\n* Several JavaScript/TypeScript testing tools\r\n* (there could be more...)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
