Summary\r\n\r\n[Mockito 5.4.0](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v5.4.0) throws an exception when a mock object is passed into `Mockito.spy()`. See\r\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2915\r\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2989\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n- Implement an inspection that can detect `Mockito.spy()` being passed in a mock object. Constructs can be like:\r\n  - `Mockito.spy(Mockito.mock(Type.class))`\r\n  - `Mockito.spy(<object annotated with @Mock>)`\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n- Should it check spies passed into `Mockito.spy()` as well?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/picimako/mockitools/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/picimako/mockitools/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14445249737,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAF62v85evkFozwAAAANdAQTJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/14445249737","actor":{"login":"saurabh7248","id":4195009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTUwMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4195009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248","html_url":"https://github.com/saurabh7248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabh7248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7c3641bcef717ffa7d765f2c86b847d0aab1aac9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saurabh7248/mockito/commits/7c3641bcef717ffa7d765f2c86b847d0aab1aac9","created_at":"2024-09-29T13:04:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
