E.g. If someone mocks the same static class with Mockito and Spock, the  `mock-maker-inline` gets confused.\r\nThe reasons for that is, that two Mockito `InlineDelegateByteBuddyMockMaker` instances try to transform static methods at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf I use the `MockUtil.getMockMaker()` Spock with Mockito and Mockito will interop nicely with each other and report an error, if the same class is mocked twice. \r\nSo the user can use Mockito-API in Spock-Tests and also Spock-API, which uses Mockito under the hood.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
