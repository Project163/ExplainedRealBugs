hoped to use it the same way as a MockedStatic instance, letting the test-environment inject me what i need.\r\n\r\nSomewhat like that:\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void testing_for_something(@Mock MockedConstruction<WhatEver> whatEverConstruction){\r\n  // arrange\r\n  //add configuration to whatEverConstruction\r\n\r\n  // act\r\n  //call something that instantiates whatEver\r\n\r\n  // assert\r\n  //stuff\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using this pattern with MockedStatic it does work, but sadly not with MockedConstruction, which has to be used in a try-with-ressources block. \r\nSince i often do not even use the MockedConstruction-instance (_not_ the mocked instances created by the mockedConstruction-instance), this leads to code-inspection warnings, and is just very boilerplaty-verbose and even prevents me from separating the arrange- and act-parts inside the test-code.\r\nThis sabotages readability a lot:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void testing_for_something(){\r\n  // arrange  \r\n  //configure other stuff\r\n  try (MockedConstruction ignored = mockConstruction(\r\n    whatEver.class,\r\n    (mock, ctx) -> {\r\n       //add configuration to mock\r\n    }\r\n  ) {\r\n    // act\r\n    //call something that instantiates WhatEver\r\n }  \r\n\r\n  // assert\r\n  //stuff\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince https://javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/3.12.4/org/mockito/MockitoAnnotations.html#openMocks-java.lang.Object- returns AutoCloseable i kinda assumed that the instances get closed after each test.\r\n\r\nI know this is marked as an incubating feature, so i hope this is useful
