right, we have been talking about this for a while so let's consolidate discussions. TLDR: more and more use cases are broken (by default) with Mockito and JDK 17. That's because the subclass mockmaker runs into fundamental limitations on JDK 17, but the inline mockmaker works as expected.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of issues related to this:\r\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2587\r\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2560\r\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2573\r\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2561 (suspected)\r\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2521 (suspected)\r\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2449 (suspected)\r\n\r\nAt this point, the rate of issues created is increasing, as more and more of our users are adopting JDK 17+\r\n\r\nWe have historically talked about this as well: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1728\r\n\r\nWhen chatting with @raphw about this issue, there were a couple of options that we have available:\r\n1. Keep on using the subclass mockmaker by default on all JDK's and suggest users to use `mockito-inline` whenever appropriate\r\n2. Switch the default to the inline mockmaker for all JDK's and put the subclass mockmaker in an artifact such as `mockito-subclass` (legacy)\r\n3. Detect the current JDK version and make the inline mockmaker the default on JDK 17+, but keep the subclass mockmaker the default for older JDK versions\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, we should opt for least amount of surprise. E.g. Mockito should \"just\" work out-of-the-box for the majority of use cases. Therefore, if Mockito (by default) does not work nicely with JDK 17 in more and more cases, I consider that a bug.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think it is a good choice to force all existing users that are on JDK 16 and below to update their codebase wholesale to the new mockmaker. Inheritently, the new mockmaker works slightly different and forcing the update onto users doesn't feel like a nice solution. In the end, it works just fine on JDK 16 on below, so why change it?\r\n\r\nTherefore, my proposed way forward is:\r\n1. We publish Mockito 5 which switches the default mockmaker to the inline mockmaker on JDK 17+\r\n2. We update the JavaDoc of the subclass mockmaker to make users aware it is only intended to be used for specific use cases\r\n\r\nIn terms of timeline, I think we should collective user feedback from the community first. This issue seems like the best place to do so. Once we are confident that we would be able to switch the default, we could publish Mockito 5. For now, what if we take June 2022 as a temporary date to make such a change, unless we receive strong/valid user feedback that should block such a change?\r\n\r\nCC @mockito/developers

file\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI implemented a prototype to fix #2626 as suggested in https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2589#issuecomment-1105163928. The basics doesn't seem that difficult, but I could have missed some edge cases. I mostly skipped documentation and tests for now. Furthermore, I ignored that `ByteBuddyMockMaker` and `InlineByteBuddyMockMaker` are not exposed by the API, so we still have to adjust the API to allow setting the mock maker without accessing these classes.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't need this functionality right now. However, if you think it would be a worthwhile addition, I can still try to help with that topic.\r\n\r\nThis pull request allows users of Mockito to choose different MockMakers per mock. This feature could ease the migration from one MockMaker to another in a big project.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSomeClass subclassMock = Mockito.mock(SomeClass.class, Mockito.withSettings()\r\n    .mockMaker(AwesomeMockMaker.class));\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~PS: The Gradle task `spotlessApply` failed on my system with *“java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class com.google.googlejavaformat.java.java14.Java14InputAstVisitor”*. Probably because it couldn't find `BindingPatternTree`. Not sure if it is a local problem or something with the project configuration.~~\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n - [x] PR should be motivated, i.e. what does it fix, why, and if relevant how\r\n - [x] If possible / relevant include an example in the description, that could help all readers\r\n       including project members to get a better picture of the change\r\n - [x] Avoid other runtime dependencies\r\n - [ ] Meaningful commit history ;
