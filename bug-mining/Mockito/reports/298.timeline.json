@TimvdLippe \r\n\r\nI found a problem and fixed the code.\r\n\r\nI think the problem was that we used stack inside ArgumentMatcherStorageImpl.java, so the order was reversed during the push/pop process.\r\n\r\nso I changed code like this (I modified it to assign the result of the popMatcher to m2 first)\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void reportAnd() {\r\n    assertStateFor(\"And(?)\", TWO_SUB_MATCHERS);\r\n\r\n    ArgumentMatcher<?> m2 = popMatcher();\r\n    ArgumentMatcher<?> m1 = popMatcher();\r\n\r\n    reportMatcher(new And(m1, m2));\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic void reportOr() {\r\n    assertStateFor(\"Or(?)\", TWO_SUB_MATCHERS);\r\n\r\n    ArgumentMatcher<?> m2 = popMatcher();\r\n    ArgumentMatcher<?> m1 = popMatcher();\r\n\r\n    reportMatcher(new Or(m1, m2));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the fix, m1 and m2 were reversed, as follows\r\n\r\n![before change](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/assets/7044743/a9a5c5b9-0f81-464c-accc-e2cdd50f3a27)\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, m1 and m2 were assigned as expected, as follows\r\n\r\n![after change](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/assets/7044743/e799ed87-5e95-4136-9c0f-983af6c5e1d7)\r\n\r\nI was happy to think I had fixed the bug.\r\nBut sadly, the error changed to the following\r\n(I used the example code provided by the author)\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.mockito.exceptions.misusing.UnnecessaryStubbingException: \r\nUnnecessary stubbings detected.\r\nClean & maintainable test code requires zero unnecessary code.\r\nFollowing stubbings are unnecessary (click to navigate to relevant line of code):\r\n  1. -> at com.example.demo.MockitoTest.test(MockitoTest.java:22)\r\nPlease remove unnecessary stubbings or use 'lenient' strictness. More info: javadoc for UnnecessaryStubbingException class.\r\n\tat org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension.afterEach(MockitoExtension.java:192)\r\n\t...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's correct that I'm getting an UnnecessaryStubbingException because I didn't enter the expected input. (Passed \"hello\", not any(MyPojo.class))\r\nHowever, something feels like the result is not clear.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?\r\nI'm wondering if this is a good fix.\r\n\r\nIf this is the right fix, I'll raise a PR with the addition of test code for this.\r\n\r\n(Note that the `./gradlew check` passed without fail.)\r\n\r\nHave a nice
