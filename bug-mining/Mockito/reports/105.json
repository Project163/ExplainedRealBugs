Google API returns Void for deleting a file. Code works fine but when I instruct my test as PowerMockito.doNothing().when(delete).execute(); It complains that execute has a return value of Void.\r\n\r\nBut PowerMock just delegates call to Mockito in this case and Mockito throws exception: \r\n\r\n```\r\norg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException: \r\nOnly void methods can doNothing()!\r\nExample of correct use of doNothing():\r\n    doNothing().\r\n    doThrow(new RuntimeException())\r\n    .when(mock).someVoidMethod();\r\nAbove means:\r\nsomeVoidMethod() does nothing the 1st time but throws an exception the 2nd time is called\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have doubts about expected behaviour. For one side, method return something, but it return a `Void` which always is just `Void` and nothing could be changed. \r\n\r\nAnyway, it could be fixed only on Mockito side (without dirty hacks).
