If a module does not have such a package, or\r\n    if for legacy reasons it must have a name that does not correspond to\r\n    one of its exported packages, then its name should at least start\r\n    with the reversed form of an Internet domain with which the author is\r\n    associated.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/camel/issues/2007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/camel/issues/2007/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1283088413,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyODMwODg0MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1283088413","actor":{"login":"zyxist","id":283244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzI0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/283244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist","html_url":"https://github.com/zyxist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyxist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8228bd3555b1a26ed01f7c75ec162630b4408d91","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zyxist/mockito/commits/8228bd3555b1a26ed01f7c75ec162630b4408d91","created_at":"2017-10-08T06:20:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1283111073,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTI4MzExMTA3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1283111073","actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"5a5c409f561c853c04974c1542fe2f65c999c263","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/commits/5a5c409f561c853c04974c1542fe2f65c999c263","created_at":"2017-10-08T08:16:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ktoso","id":120979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDk3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso","html_url":"https://github.com/ktoso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-31T06:04:00Z","updated_at":"2017-10-31T06:04:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23789","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23789/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23789/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23789/events","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/issues/23789","id":263418609,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNjM0MTg2MDk=","number":23789,"title":"Release

N/A .\r\n\r\n#### Changes proposed in this PR:\r\n- Add an Automatic-Module-Name entry to the MANIFEST.MF in order to be able to use the project as a dependency in modularized projects\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\n\r\nWe are developing a Combinatorial Testing Framework at [coffee4j](https://github.com/coffee4j/coffee4j) and we're using Choco Solver as a dependency. We aim to modularize our project with Java 9 Modules introduced with [Project Jigsaw](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/).\r\nWhile compiling maven gives us this error message:\r\n```\r\n***********************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n* Required filename-based automodules detected: [choco-solver-4.10.0.jar]. Please don't publish this project to a public artifact repository! *\r\n***********************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n```\r\nas Choco Solver does indeed not specify an automatic module name. Other popular projects like Mockito (see mockito/mockito#1195 and mockito/mockito#1189) or AssertJ (see joel-costigliola/assertj-core#1221 and joel-costigliola/assertj-core#1220) in the past solved this problem by adding an Automatic-Module-Name entry to the MANIFEST.MF (short explanation how [here](http://branchandbound.net/blog/java/2017/12/automatic-module-name/), short summary of [naming conventions](https://sormuras.github.io/blog/2018-11-16-invalid-automatic-module-names.html) from one of the JUnit Developers).\r\n\r\nWe'd loved to see this change integrated, because we would like to use Java 9 Modules while still being able to publish our project to a public repository.\r\n \r\n@chocoteam/core-developer\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chocoteam/choco-solver/issues/634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chocoteam/choco-solver/issues/634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
