#3077 \r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAdds granularity to the logic that skips reporting of unused stubbings when tests are filtered. Instead of simply detecting the use of any kind of filter, intercepts uses of that filter and only skips reporting of unused stubbings when the filter actually prevents one or more tests from being run.\r\n\r\nThis allows filters (such as JUnit category excludes, which themselves can be used to separate unit and integration tests) to be applied during a test run without sacrificing the benefits of strict stubbing.\r\n\r\nTesting coverage is added for this newly-handled case (i.e., when a filter does not prevent any tests from being run), as well as existing cases (i.e., when a filter does prevent at least one test from being run).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n - [x] PR should be

Jenkinsfile is currently configured to do testing with the `unitTest` and `integrationTest` tasks, instead of the `test` task. These tasks use JUnit test category filters to distinguish between integration and non-integration tests. Because of https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3077, if a JUnit test category filter is used, Mockito does not report unused stubbings. As a result, our CI builds currently don't catch unused stubbings.\r\n\r\nAlthough an upstream fix has been implemented with https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/3078, a release has not yet been published with that fix. Even when a new release is published, it will take place on the 5.x.y line, which requires JDK 11+ (see the [5.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v5.0.0)).\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we can switch to using the `test` task instead of the `unitTest` and `integrationTest` tasks. If there are benefits to the two-task approach, we can revert to that approach once we begin work on Kafka 4.0 (which drops support for Java 8) and upgrade to a version of Mockito with the fix.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
