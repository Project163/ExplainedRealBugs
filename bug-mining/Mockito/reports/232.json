When testing a modular application, it is common to have packages encapsulated by default.\r\n\r\n### Stacktrace\r\n\r\nIn FieldReader, the IllegalAccessException is caught. The exception is re-thrown but the cause is lost.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/ea000f72444ed4c7e409441aedc3021951b89660/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/util/reflection/FieldReader.java#L28-L35\r\n\r\nUsing a debugger, the IllegalAccessException can be observed: https://pastebin.com/GsnU29QV\r\n\r\n### Problematic Code\r\n\r\n1. Use `module-info` in the project and don't open the package under test to mockito.\r\n\r\n2. Use the `MockitoExtension` for JUnit:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)\r\npublic class MyClassTest {\r\n\r\n  private final MyType mock;\r\n\r\n  public MyClassTest(@Mock MyType mock) {\r\n    this.mock = mock;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nMockito-Junit-Jupiter 3.9.0\r\nZulu16.28+11-CA (build 16+36)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2266/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
