The zero slot is in no way privileged. The verifier already tracks if the slot is reassigned to avoid super calls on other identities then the currently dispatched instance. At the same time, it allows such calls if 'this' is reassigned to another slot later from that targeted slot. \r\n\r\nIf I am reading the spec correctly, this is also perfectly legal. It only defines on what slot 'this' is passed to a method. I do neither think such reassignment is affecting the JIT where 'this' is no longer a special variable once the verifier is satisfied. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Byte Buddy retains the 'this' variable at slot 0. As a matter of fact, that's the point of it. It makes a defensive copy of the original array to function when obfuscators or alternative JVM languages are used which sometimes reassign slots that are no longer used in the code. Therefore, I am wondering what both IDEs are doing if this is both available at slot 0 and on the copied slot that is referrenced in the LVT. It would be available from both locations.

Since we prepend the line number to the very beginning of any method in order to add that line number to exceptions we throw from mocked methods, the debugger will stop if a break point is placed in the very first line of a method, even if the mocked path of the inline-mocked method is dispatched. In this case, no variables (including *this*) are displayed since the *real code* is never invoked but the call gets redirected into Mockito's own infrastructure. @TimvdLippe I think we rather have the Mockito exceptions show the right line number rather then not break in the first line of a method in case that a break point is set there, but maybe we should document this
