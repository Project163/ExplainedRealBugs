The method `findAnswerFor(invocation)` might return `null` but no null check is performed on the returned value inside the `answerTo` method which might cause null pointer exception. Here's the affected code snippet:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    Object answerTo(Invocation invocation) throws Throwable {\r\n        return findAnswerFor(invocation).answer(invocation);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public StubbedInvocationMatcher findAnswerFor(Invocation invocation) {\r\n        synchronized (stubbed) {\r\n            for (StubbedInvocationMatcher s : stubbed) {\r\n                if (s.matches(invocation)) {\r\n                    s.markStubUsed(invocation);\r\n                    // TODO we should mark stubbed at the point of stubbing, not at the point where\r\n                    // the stub is being used\r\n                    invocation.markStubbed(new StubInfoImpl(s));\r\n                    return s;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe static analysis was ran on version: `v4.11.0`\r\n\r\n## Sponsorship and Support\r\n\r\nThis work is done by the security researchers from [OpenRefactory](https://openrefactory.com) and is supported by the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/): [Project Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/).
