certain specific, rare scenarios (issue #1614) inline mocking causes memory leaks. There is no clean way to mitigate this problem completely. Hence, we introduced a new API to explicitly clear mock state (only make sense in inline mocking!):\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ExampleTest {\r\n\r\n     @After\r\n     public void clearMocks() {\r\n         Mockito.framework().clearInlineMocks();\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     @Test\r\n     public void someTest() {\r\n         //...\r\n     }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDue to the introduction of map from weak reference from mock instance to\r\nits invocation handler, Mockito became vulnerable to memory leaks as\r\nthere are multiple situations where Mockito could unintentionally hold\r\nstrong references to mock instances in the map record. The strong\r\nreferences could be through spiedInstance for spies, and arguments used\r\nto facilitate method stubbing.\r\n\r\nMockito could never know if the arguments passed in for method stubbing\r\nare also strongly referenced somewhere else or not, so Mockito needs to\r\nsave a strong reference to these arguments to avoid premature GC.\r\nTherefore to solve cyclic strong references through arguments Mockito\r\nneeds to explicitly know when mocks are out of their life, and clean\r\nup all internal strong references associated with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #1532 and #1533.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2172384221,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNzIzODQyMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2172384221","actor":{"login":"ttanxu","id":3538432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mzg0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3538432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu","html_url":"https://github.com/ttanxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c1ad3a0a54f792a271f8010ed430f59e59b614d7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ttanxu/mockito/commits/c1ad3a0a54f792a271f8010ed430f59e59b614d7","created_at":"2019-02-28T21:36:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2172485538,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNzI0ODU1Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2172485538","actor":{"login":"ttanxu","id":3538432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mzg0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3538432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu","html_url":"https://github.com/ttanxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f464f7a91936ea3d9b8392287535c12b111c759f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ttanxu/mockito/commits/f464f7a91936ea3d9b8392287535c12b111c759f","created_at":"2019-02-28T22:20:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2172503312,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNzI1MDMzMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2172503312","actor":{"login":"ttanxu","id":3538432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mzg0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3538432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu","html_url":"https://github.com/ttanxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a2fc2d695a0136e85ede0baa0c8aaa6f1af84aef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ttanxu/mockito/commits/a2fc2d695a0136e85ede0baa0c8aaa6f1af84aef","created_at":"2019-02-28T22:28:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2172520545,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNzI1MjA1NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2172520545","actor":{"login":"ttanxu","id":3538432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mzg0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3538432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu","html_url":"https://github.com/ttanxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"htt

*\r\n * This class will serve as the programmatic entry point to all mockito internal MockMakers.\r\n * Currently the default and only mock maker is the subclassing engine, but with enough feedback we can later\r\n * promote the inlining engine for features like final class/methods mocks.\r\n *\r\n * The programmatic API could look like {@code mock(Final.class, withSettings().finalClasses())}.\r\n */\r\n```\r\nI wonder — does this still hold true? I’m asking mostly from experience described in #1532 and #1533. This lead to #1614 and [an awkward API](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/What%27s-new-in-Mockito-2#mockito-2250):\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n@After fun clearMocks() {\r\n    Mockito.framework().clearInlineMocks()\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf there are plans to make it default anyway it would be great to still make it opt-in or easily opt-out.
