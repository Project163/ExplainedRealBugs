There was once some totally misplaced loop that did initialization multiple times.\r\n2. Somebody saw that and fixed it https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/1588 @LihMeh\r\n3. Another guy(@tokuhirom) comes that relied on the bug and declared the bug a feature. Namely that even if there is a valid constructor other left over fields should be field injected(by accident). https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/1810 . He also never updated the docs to declare his behaviour. Probably more ppl would have complained about this if it was not only working under rare condition (the test class extends another class). Even more would need to be done for that feature to work anyways I think. \r\n4.

wanted to chime in on this as it seems this issue and the combination of #2942 may have made @InjectMocks unusable in a larger than intended number of cases.\r\n\r\nThe root of the issue is that when the field injection occurs on a super class and the super class has a loosely typed field such as object. The mocking will completely fail because all mocks will match this field in the super class. So this forces people to mock all fields in the entire hierarchy of the class even if constructor injection succeeds and is preferred which is counter to the documentation as mentioned above.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/1575354347/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Sheikah45","id":66929319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTI5MzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66929319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45","html_url":"https://github.com/Sheikah45","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9423553780,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAF62v85F_YtZzwAAAAIxsAT0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/9423553780","actor":{"login":"Injectmocks","id":103880021,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjEVVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103880021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks","html_url":"https://github.com/Injectmocks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-04T03:10:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9423553782,"node_id":"SE_lADOAF62v85F_YtZzwAAAAIxsAT2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/9423553782","actor":{"login":"Injectmocks","id":103880021,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjEVVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103880021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks","html_url":"https://github.com/Injectmocks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Injectmocks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-04T03:10:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Sheikah45","id":66929319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTI5MzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66929319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45","html_url":"https://github.com/Sheikah45","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheikah45/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-04T13:14:09Z","updated_at":"2023-06-04T13:14:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2978","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2978/labels{/name}","comments_u

5.3.0, due to https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2942/commits, a regression was introduced.\r\nI investigated the issue with my colleague @sftwr-ngnr (thanks Urs for pairing)\r\n\r\nThe issue happens when:\r\n\r\n- You have a parent class for your test classes.\r\n- You have a class:\r\n  - Initialized using `@InjectMocks`.\r\n  - Some fields are injected through the constructor and other fields are not.\r\n  - There are multiple candidate mocks for the field not initialized in the constructor.\r\n\r\nIn this case, since we have a parent test class, you will run the initialization twice. Consider that, everytime that you call `MockInjection` (one per test class, the actual and the parent), you use the inner class `OngoingMockInjection` to add two `injectionStrategies`:\r\n\r\n- `ConstructorInjection`\r\n- `PropertyAndSetterInjection`\r\n\r\nSo, for the first invocation, the method `processInjection` in `ConstructorInjection` will initialize the class annotated with `@InjectMocks` inside helper class `FieldInitializationReport` by checking that `Plugins.getMemberAccessor()` in `FieldInitializer` has no value for the `fieldInstance` (see line 141 and 142 in `FieldInitializer`).\r\nFor the second invocation, since `Plugins.getMemberAccessor()` in `FieldInitializer` has already an initialized value for the `fieldInstance`, then we return false and enable propagating the execution of `PropertyAndSetterInjection`.\r\n\r\nHere it comes the problem. With the changes in https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2942/commits, the `TypeBasedCandidateFilter` is triggered to find for all the remaining fields not set via constructor any candidate mock to be set. If there is more than one, it throws the exception from method `moreThanOneMockCandidate`.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce it. Create a JUnit5 project with Mockito 5.3.0\r\nAdd the following production code in dedicated Java files\r\n```java\r\npublic interface Dependency {\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic interface Dependency1 extends Dependency{\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic interface Dependency2 extends Dependency{\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Service implements Dependency {\r\n\r\n\tprivate Dependency dependency;\r\n\r\n\tprivate final Dependency1 dependency1;\r\n\tprivate final Dependency2 dependency2;\r\n\r\n\tpublic Service(Dependency1 dependency1, Dependency2 dependency2) {\r\n\t\tthis.dependency1 = dependency1;\r\n\t\tthis.dependency2 = dependency2;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tvoid postConstruct() {\r\n\t\tdependency = null; // it could be something else, like a call to a context or to new\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nand then in the test folder add dedicated Java files for the following classes\r\n```java\r\npublic abstract class AbstractTest {\r\n}\r\n\r\n@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)\r\nclass ServiceTest extends AbstractTest {\r\n\r\n\t@Mock\r\n\tDependency1 dependency1;\r\n\t@Mock\r\n\tDependency2 dependency2;\r\n\t@InjectMocks\r\n\tService service;\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tvoid injectionFails() {\r\n\t\tAssertions.assertNotNull(service);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get\r\n```java\r\nMockito couldn't inject mock dependency on field 'private org.example.Dependency org.example.Service.dependency' that is annotated with @InjectMocks in your test, \r\nbecause there were multiple matching mocks (i.e. fields annotated with @Mock and having matching type): dependency1, dependency2.\r\nIf you have multiple fields of same type in your class under test then consider naming the @Mock fields identically to the respective class under test's fields, so Mockito can match them by name.\r\norg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException: \r\nMockito couldn't inject mock
