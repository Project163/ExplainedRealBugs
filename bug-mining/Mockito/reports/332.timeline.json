The way the original settings are passed has some weird behavior as well, because it results in inconsistent behavior for repeated calls to `clearInlineMocks()`. Any duplicate calls to `clearInlineMocks()` will fail for NPEs, because we clone in the previous setting according to the handler, after the first clear call the handler is a DisabledHandler and will only return nulls, this will lead to an NPE on any subsequent calls. So I think we need to implement some why for the DisabledHandler to return a sane MockCreationSettings Object.
