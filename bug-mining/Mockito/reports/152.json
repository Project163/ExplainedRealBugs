one of `doThrow` instructions failed due to InstantiationError, Mockito remains in \"unfinished stubbing\" state and can no longer mock anything.\r\n\r\nI had this issue in a single JUnit 4 test, but the fact that Mockito remained in \"unfinished stubbing\" state used to result in _all_ tests being marked as failed (I couldn't reproduce the last effect with the latest Mockito neither in JUnit 4 nor with JUnit 5 now, so the issue is applicable to a single test invocation only).\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.RepeatedTest;\r\nimport
