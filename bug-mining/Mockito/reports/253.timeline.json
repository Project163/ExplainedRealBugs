was a deliberate change as we had some caching issues with the previous solution. We can only inherit the annotations of one superclass/supertype. Mockito would create the same mock for:\r\n\r\nmocked class: `SomeInterface.class`\r\nmocked class: `Object.class`, additional interfaces: `SomeInterface.class`\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to inherit annotations, if the second mock already was created and in the cache, the request for the first mock would lack annotations as the first call inherited them from `Object` (which effectively means nothing). A similar issue would arise if:\r\n\r\nmocked class: `SomeInterface.class`, additional interfaces: `OtherInterface.class`\r\nmocked class: `OtherInterface.class`, additional interfaces: `SomeInterface.class`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could disable annotation inheritance only for the case with more then one annotation being involved and only inherit from a single annotation if the superclass was `Object`. My aim here was to make the mock making deterministic and not to depend on order. As the JVM does not inherit annotations from interfaces, droping the feature for interfaces felt like a sound approach.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/1126658460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/1129283697","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2640#issuecomment-1129283697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2640","id":1129283697,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAF62v85DT4Bx","user":{"login":"chrisgleissner","id":3969147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3969147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisgleissner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisgleissner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T20:23:19Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T20:23:19Z","body":"After upgrading to Mockito 4.5.1, the Spring @SpyBean annotation on Feign- and Resilience4J-annoyated REST client Java interfaces no longer works as it did with Mockito 4.4.x and earlier.
