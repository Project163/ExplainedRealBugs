However, when integrating this change within Google, we ran into numerous issues.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninvocation.getArgumentAt(0, Runnable.class).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\ngets rewritten to\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninvocation.getArgument(0).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not compile, as the generic parameter is erasured to `Object` and thus does not have the `run` method.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would propose adding back an overload to `getArgument` that allows you to specify the `Class`. In general, users would not need this inside a variable assignment, but do need it in all other cases.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1609/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
