Here is my proposition:\n##### Initialization and invocations:\n\n``` java\nList firstMock = mock(List.class);\nList secondMock = mock(List.class);\n\nfirstMock.add(\"was called first\");\nsecondMock.add(\"was called second\");\nsecondMock.add(\"was called second\");\n\nInOrder inOrder = inOrder(firstMock, secondMock);\n```\n##### Current non-BDD solution:\n\n``` java\ninOrder.verify(firstMock).add(\"was called first\");\ninOrder.verify(secondMock).add(\"was called second\");\n```\n##### Proposition 1:\n\n``` java\ninOrder.then(firstMock).should().add(\"was called first\");\ninOrder.then(secondMock).should(times(2)).add(\"was called second\");\n```\n##### Proposition 2:\n\n``` java\nthen(firstMock).should(inOrder).add(\"was called first\");\nthen(secondMock).should(inOrder, times(2)).add(\"was called second\");\n```\n\nI'm open to other propositions. What do you think? \nI can proceed with PR as soon as we will agree on API.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
