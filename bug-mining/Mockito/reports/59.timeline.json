A mocked method contains its generic type: A mocked method of type List<String> will not be erased to List. Many frameworks / libraries extract this information and would then react differently when encountering an instance of the mock class compared to the original class.\n    2. Bridge methods can only be resolved appropriately when the generic type information is processed.
