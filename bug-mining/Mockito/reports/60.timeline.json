looks like the metadata is now correct, however when running tests in an osgi container, I am unable to mock classes (see error below). I built a custom version of the mockito jar and embedded the byte-buddy and objenesis classes inside the mockito jar (instead of loading them as separate bundles) and the error went away. I think the problem is that byte-buddy classloader doesn't have access to the same classes as the mockito classloader when they are in separate bundles.

think you are right and we did it wrong when we ported the old \"searching class loader\" to Byte Buddy's multiple parent class loader. The old solution strongly referenced types defined by cglib while Byte Buddy short wires the interceptors from Mockito without creating any Byte Buddy dependency. Typically, Byte Buddy's and Mockito's class loaders are equal. This is only not the case when exporting both libraries as OSGi bundles. If you bundle both libraries in the same jar, this class loader equality is reinstated which is why this works.\n\nAs a consequence of the change code generation strategy, we do not even need to export Byte Buddy, it is never exposed by Mockito in the generated code.\n\nAs you already created a custom build, can you try changing the `MockBytecodeGenerator` to create a multiple parent class loader as follows:\n\n``` java\nnew MultipleParentClassLoader.Builder()\n  .append(features.mockedType)\n  .append(features.interfaces)\n  .append(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader())\n  .append(MockAccess.class, DispatcherDefaultingToRealMethod.class)\n  .append(MockMethodInterceptor.class, \n               MockMethodInterceptor.ForHashCode.class, \n               MockMethodInterceptor.ForEquals.class)\n```\n\nThank you for your analysis and help so far, we appreciate it!\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/227680644/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":704352486,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDcwNDM1MjQ4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/704352486","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"575e7ce7dec492b2e9c667c04617583061ea365a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/commits/575e7ce7dec492b2e9c667c04617583061ea365a","created_at":"2016-06-26T22:51:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-26T22:52:04Z","updated_at":"2016-06-26T22:52:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/471","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/471/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/471/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/471/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/471","id":162352153,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzUyNDMxNTE=","number":471,"title":"Reference
