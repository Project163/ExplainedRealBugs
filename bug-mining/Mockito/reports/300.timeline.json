Motivation\r\nIn the latest version of mockito-core (5.9.0), the `Only.verify` method throws a `NullPointerException` when it attempts to call `Reporter.noMoreInteractionsWanted` with a null argument. This occurs because the method `InvocationsFinder.findFirstUnverified` can return null, but this is not handled properly in `Only.verify`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #3237 \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added a null check for the result of `InvocationsFinder.findFirstUnverified` in `Only.verify`. If the result is null, `Reporter.noMoreInteractionsWanted` is not called.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n - [v] Read the [contributing
