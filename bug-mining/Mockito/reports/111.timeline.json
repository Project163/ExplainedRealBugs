you guys for really thorough debugging!\r\n\r\n>This is a bug in the UnusedStubbingFinder which should not rely on the stack shape.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason why the finder relies on the String representation of line where the unused stub is declared. I documented it in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2.x/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/junit/UnusedStubbingsFinder.java#L46), hopefully it is more less clear :) I'm not saying we should keep the current implementation, I'm ok changing it, I just wanted to give more data points.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this thread my gut feel tells me that the stack trace filter (different component than unused stubbing detection) may not be coping well with inline mocking. This could also have impact on stack trace filtering in general for inline mocking, the quality of exception messages, etc.\r\n\r\n@tmurakami, you made fantastic debugging effort to nail down the problem.
