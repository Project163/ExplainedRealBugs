For explicitness, you can still depend on mockito-inline, but behaviourally it will have no effect. It would be similar if you would use `mockito-subclass` on Mockito 4. That said, I guess we can remove it in the next release, as it was only used during the transition period for Mockito 5. Not sure if we should simply stop publishing the artifact or we consider that a breaking change for the BOM. @raphw
