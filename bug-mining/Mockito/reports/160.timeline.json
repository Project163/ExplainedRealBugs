However note that using `mock()`style would not work unless we use some `TypeReference` trick.\n\n> It gets more difficult if the mock's type is an instantiation of a generic type (e.g. @Mock Foo<Bar> x;), since the field's type arguments get dropped. I think fixing that would require adding support for mocking types, not just classes.\n\n@raphw I think we should not delay 2.0 for that one, JDK9 is not yet out. We can still release fixes

There are three scenarios:\n1. For generic return types, it suffices to resolve those return types properly by using `GenericMetadataSupport`. This can simply be added, I already tried this.\n2. For locally inferred generic return types, there is not much we can do. For example, if we mocked some method `public <T> T foo() { ... }` there is no information preserved within the method that would allow us to know the expected type for `T`. We could only parse any method from where `foo` was called to contextually determine the return type. This would add a whole new layer of complexity to Mockito and I do not think we should support this case. We should probably add a warning to the docs.\n3. For generic fields, we could find ways to preserve this information. We should probably refactor the `RETURN_SMART_NULLS` option to allow its binding to a generic base type rather than using the mock instance's (raw)
