PR intends to fix #1551. For fix it, the `ReturnsSmartNulls` answer use now some reflection to find the correct return type instead of the `java.util.Object`.\r\n\r\nWhen the return type can be found, it will start to retrieve empty values using the answer `ReturnsMoreEmptyValues` & `ReturnsEmptyValues` before creating a new mock instance.\r\n\r\nAs you may notice in tests, there is still one case where the return type cannot be found. In this case, the `Answer` will return a `null` instead of `Object` mock.\r\n\r\nI think, it may be possible to improve this code.
