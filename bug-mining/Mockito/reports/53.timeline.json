#426 for class Reporter \n\nThis PR changes the way errors are created and thrown. All methods of the Reporter are now static so they can be imported statically and return an exception instead of throwing it directly. This improves the readability and eliminates the use of hacks to satisfiy the compiler.\n\nHere is a sample:\n\n```\npublic List<T> getLastVarargs() {\n        if (arguments.isEmpty()) {\n            Reporter().noArgumentValueWasCaptured();\n            return null;\n        } else {\n            return arguments.getLast();\n        }\n}\n```\n\nThe above code snipped can be rewritten to this:\n\n```\npublic List<T> getLastVarargs() {\n        if (arguments.isEmpty()) {\n            throw noArgumentValueWasCaptured();\n        } \n        return arguments.getLast();\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":689434392,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Njg5NDM0Mzky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/689434392","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-11T15:16:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/225369495","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/426#issuecomment-225369495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/426","id":225369495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTM2OTQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"ChristianSchwarz","id":1437411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzc0MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristianSchwarz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-11T15:21:52Z","updated_at":"2016-06-11T15:21:52Z","body":"@raphw thanks for merging the PR that fast!
