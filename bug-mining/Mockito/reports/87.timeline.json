is the entry point for user friendly usage from within the test. Inspecting mocks looks wrong when it's a normal _user_.\n\nHowever I know framework developers may need to inspect mocks. Let's keep the `MockingDetails` type but instantiate it from another static factory method.\n\nThe drawback is the removal of this API for current users.

trying to get closure on awkward Mockito.debug().printInvocations() API. The API is semi-internal, package-protected and deprecated :) This API is simply unfinished (just like the verbose JUnit runner was unfinished until recently).\n\nOptions for Mockito.debug().printInvocations()\n1. delete this API without replacement, wait for users feedback if they need it.\n2. move to MockingDetails.printInvocations() and make public (already planned in #543)\n3. move to Mockito.framework().printInvocations() and make public\n4. option 2) + some composite mocking details API so that we can print invocations across multiple mocks\n5. ?\n\nMy thinking:\n\n1) Tempting, we already have 'verbose mode'. Still, it feels the feature is useful and is mentioned on SO (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11802088/how-do-i-enable-mockito-debug-messages). I don't think users will request this feature even if it is useful because they can use existing API and hack up a solution.\n2) I like it. However, it is not as powerful because usually we want to investigate the behavior / stubbing of multiple mocks. MockingDetails only covers a single mock. Original printInvocations() method neatly shows interactions/stubbings in order across multiple mock objects.\n3) Mockito.framework() already exists so we could use it. However, it feels that printing invocations is not really for framework integrators so I don't think it is a good place for this API.\n4) Option (2) with the multi-mock feature. I kinda like it. Example how it could work:\n\nMockito.mockingDetails(mock).isMock();\nMockito.mockingDetails(mock).getInvocations();\nMockito.mockingDetails(mock).printInvocations();\n\n~~Mockito.mockingDetails(mock, mock2, mock3).isMock();~~\nMockito.mockingDetails(mock, mock2, mock3).getInvocations();\nMockito.mockingDetails(mock, mock2, mock3).printInvocations();\n\nSignatures:\n\npublic MockingDetails mockingDetails(Object mock); //existing\npublic CompositeMockingDetails mockingDetails(Object ... mocks); //new\nMockingDetails extends CompositeMockingDetails //API consistency\n\nCompositeMockingDetails //new interface\nCompositeMockingDetails.getInvocations()\nCompositeMockingDetails.printInvocations()\nCompositeMockingDetails.getStubbings() //see #542\n\nYour

However, it solves the problem above and it is consistent with semantic versioning :)\n\nMockito release process (continuous delivery) does not include multiple features in a single version, with the exception for major version releases. I consider the 2.2.0 milestone as rough plan for what's after 2.1.0 but not a feature set to include in a specific version. Every new feature / change will ship a separate version, like 2.2.1, 2.2.2, etc.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/252441375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/252450745","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/542#issuecomment-252450745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/542","id":252450745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjQ1MDc0NQ==","user":{"login":"bric3","id":803621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3","html_url":"https://github.com/bric3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bric3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-08T21:57:53Z","updated_at":"2016-10-08T21:57:53Z","body":"> The reason we need to release 2.2.0 is to remove 2.2.0-beta version from being the latest in central.\n\nI don't agree.
