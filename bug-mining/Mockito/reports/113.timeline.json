This is static type safe, and refactoring friendly. So I find it preferable when it meets my needs.\r\n2. The constructor can use instance fields or instance methods of the enclosing test object.\r\n3. The main drawback is that you can't easily construct difference instances with different constructor parameters. On the other hand, I strive to keep my abstract classes stateless so I rarely need to pass constructor parameters anyway.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/277484656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fluentfuture","id":3457808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTc4MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture","html_url":"https://github.com/fluentfuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/277485778","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/685#issuecomment-277485778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/685","id":277485778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzQ4NTc3OA==","user":{"login":"fluentfuture","id":3457808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTc4MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture","html_url":"https://github.com/fluentfuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluentfuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-04T23:27:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-04T23:28:48Z","body":"I forgot to mention that it is possible with today's API to pass different constructor parameters, through MockSettings.

that ```useContructor(args...)``` reads nicer.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm not convinced that the dynamic type support is worth the effort. It seems to be a slippery slope toward defeating Java static type safety, which reminds me of the ancient JMock vs. EasyMock comparison where the former relied on type-less reflection while the latter is static type safe. If Java doesn't allow you to call `new Foo(Object, Object)`, does Mockito have to open that back door (when the enclosing class trick could be used to achieve the goal, albeit slightly indirectly)?\r\n\r\nThat said, if you do decide to add this feature, there are a few implementation caveats that we need to be careful about:\r\n* Overload resolution. It's not hard to imagine passing an arg whose static type suggests constructor overload1 to be invoked, but the runtime type actually invokes overload2. In other words, `new Foo(a, b) {...}` and `useConstructor(a, b)` result in different constructor being invoked.\r\n* Generics. There is no way to verify that the passed in `List<Something>` is actually a `List<String>`, even at runtime, risking unchecked type errors.\r\n* Visibility. What happens if the constructor has both public constructor and package-private constructor both could have been chosen for the given

Mockito API is not robust\r\nenough if it supports mocking with constructor but not when one has\r\nany constructor parameters.\r\n\r\nThis patch enhances the `MockSettings#useConstrctor()` method (as suggested in the alternative API comment in the issue) and adds\r\noptional ellipsis arguments that are passed to the constructor.\r\n\r\nThe patch streamlines the creation of mocks via constructors to a\r\nsingle flow, where using a no-arg constructor or an enclosing class\r\nare just private cases of this flow, and don't require their own\r\nspecial treatment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/935/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":959168294,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk1OTE2ODI5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/959168294","actor":{"login":"mureinik","id":4173849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzM4NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4173849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik","html_url":"https://github.com/mureinik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"323a1d279cf960d893cfcd1f72e549c6390b9737","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mureinik/mockito/commits/323a1d279cf960d893cfcd1f72e549c6390b9737","created_at":"2017-02-13T08:19:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":960251264,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk2MDI1MTI2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/960251264","actor":{"login":"mureinik","id":4173849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzM4NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4173849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik","html_url":"https://github.com/mureinik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b56bd385c6f3cc9f27f27fa35264b3c22f956a30","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mureinik/mockito/commits/b56bd385c6f3cc9f27f27fa35264b3c22f956a30","created_at":"2017-02-13T20:07:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":960288666,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk2MDI4ODY2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/960288666","actor":{"login":"mureinik","id":4173849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzM4NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4173849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik","html_url":"https://github.com/mureinik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9fc538c89d1fa0e41517a11ef1f4ab997b402b34","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mureinik/mockito/commits/9fc538c89d1fa0e41517a11ef1f4ab997b402b34","created_at":"2017-02-13T20:34:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":960363871,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk2MDM2Mzg3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/960363871","actor":{"login":"mureinik","id":4173849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzM4NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4173849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik","html_url":"https://github.com/mureinik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mureinik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"
