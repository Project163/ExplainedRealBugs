On this machine ,created `Throwable`, is initalized with all nulls.\nAs a result calling `throwable.fillInStackTrace()` has no effect and there is no chance the stack trace is ever filled. You can easily observe this behaviour by this sample code:\n\n``` java\nThrowable t = (Throwable) ObjenesisHelper.newInstance(Throwable.class);\nt.fillInStackTrace();\nt.printStackTrace();\n```\n\nAfter a bit of struggling I ended up using `ThrowsException` instead of `ThrowsExceptionClass`.\n\nObjenesis strategy to create instances is dependent on VM name (returned by `System.getProperty(\"java.vm.name\")`) so there is no 100% guarantee that this behaviour is reproduced on your machine.\n","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
