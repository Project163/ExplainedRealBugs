Looked into why and was able to reduce the issue to [a reproducible test case](https://github.com/hansjoachim/mockito/blob/confusedSignature/src/test/java/org/mockito/ConfusedSignatureTest.java). \n\nIt looks like the problem is somehow caused by the method signature for `getFoo()`. The subclass gets this method from two places, the superclass with generic return type and from the interface with a concrete one, and this seems to be confusing Mockito. \n\nThe test works with 1.10.19, but fails with 2.0.90-beta (/latest HEAD).\n\nPS. Feel free to replace the title with something more descriptive.\n","closed_by":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
