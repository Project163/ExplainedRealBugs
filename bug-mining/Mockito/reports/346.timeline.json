PR resolves issue #3659 by adding support for JDK 21's Sequenced Collections.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJEP 431 introduced new SequencedCollection, SequencedSet, and SequencedMap interfaces in JDK 21. When a mock method with one of these return types was unstubbed, Mockito would previously return null instead of an empty collection.\r\n\r\nImplementation Details\r\n\r\nTo address this while maintaining Java 11 compatibility, ReturnsEmptyValues has been updated. The key changes are:\r\n\r\nA new private method, returnValueForSequencedCollection, was introduced to handle the reflection-based checks in isolation.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate Object returnValueForSequencedCollection(Class<?> type) {\r\n    String typeName = type.getName();\r\n    if (\"java.util.SequencedCollection\".equals(typeName)) {\r\n        return new ArrayList<>();\r\n    } else if (\"java.util.SequencedSet\".equals(typeName)) {\r\n        return new LinkedHashSet<>();\r\n    } else if (\"java.util.SequencedMap\".equals(typeName)) {\r\n        return new LinkedHashMap<>();\r\n    }\r\n    // Return null to allow other checks to proceed.\r\n    return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis method is called at the beginning of returnValueFor to prioritize these special version-specific checks.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nObject returnValueFor(Class<?> type) {\r\n    // 1. Handle special Sequenced Collections first.\r\n    Object sequencedCollection = returnValueForSequencedCollection(type);\r\n    if (sequencedCollection != null) {\r\n        return sequencedCollection;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ... rest of the code\r\n```\r\nFixes #3659\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Read the [contributing
