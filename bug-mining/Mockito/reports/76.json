Branch out to `release/2.x`\n   1. Release `2.0.0`\n   2. Patch issue\n   3. Release `2.0.1`\n   4. Additional work on 2.1\n   5. Release `2.1.0`\n   6. ...\n   7. Forget about `2.1.x`\n   8. Critical fixes only get released\n2. Upgrade `master` to `3.0.0-beta-<build number>`\n   1. Start mockito `3.0.0` progress there (like java 8 only, drop APIs)\n\nAlso with recent change in the build script we could now release and check the release version with the branch.\n\nSee \n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/commit/b6a402f16e9222605638efe9b57eccc80a197f9e#diff-33cf41d9669aaef72ca19c641dc57d47R68\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/586#issuecomment-242076979\n- https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/483#issuecomment-231323266\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/594/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
