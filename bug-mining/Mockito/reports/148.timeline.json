opened issue #1578 a few weeks ago that went without an correspondence, so I apologize if submitting a PR isn't the ideal method of moving this issue forward.  However I am hoping I can get this fix incorporated into an official version without implementing temporary workarounds.\r\n\r\nThe PR should clearly show the issue I am trying to fix, but I had to introduce a testCompile snapshot dependency.  The dependent project has a fix required to demonstrate the issue within Mockito but it unfortunately has not been incorporated into an official release, and I can't think of another way to reproduce the issue.  I have contacted the owner of the dependent project but I haven't received a response from them either.\r\n\r\nI am looking for guidance on next steps for what I believe to be regression (reported to be working in #353).  The only other solution I can think of is to merge this without a unit test but I highly doubt that is desirable.\r\n\r\n_Git Commit Message_\r\n- problem - JUnitRule detects an unfinished mocking session when an inner class is detected\r\n- fix - if a MockitoSession has been established for JUnitRule, then use that and init mocks of the inner class.\r\n- tests - within an inner class ... ensure mocks are accessible, override outer class values when desired, retain original values if not overwritten\r\n- demonstrated with de.bechte.junit:junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner:4.12.2-SNAPSHOT","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2110918501,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjExMDkxODUwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2110918501","actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"4affa6618bb134fb8278a10d9dac3f9cc6729652","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/commits/4affa6618bb134fb8278a10d9dac3f9cc6729652","created_at":"2019-01-31T23:39:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2160454977,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNjA0NTQ5Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/2160454977","actor":{"login":"SamBarker","id":2833578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzM1Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2833578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker","html_url":"https://github.com/SamBarker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamBarker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"de957b10b6bb591914cc0e805bde3be086458247","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SamBarker/mockito/commits/de957b10b6bb591914cc0e805bde3be086458247","created_at":"2019-02-25T00:53:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13182387955,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAF62v84Xk3AhzwAAAAMRu0bz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/13182387955","actor":{"login":"hudawei996","id":13159223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTU5MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13159223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996","html_url":"https://github.com/hudawei996","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudawei996/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4affa6618bb134fb8278a10d9dac3f9cc6729652","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudawei996/mockito/commits/4affa6618bb134fb8278a10d9dac3f9cc6729652","created_at":"2024-06-17T09:07:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
