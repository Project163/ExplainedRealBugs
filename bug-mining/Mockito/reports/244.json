The generic method has the return type `Object` which is obviously assignable from `mockType`. This causes mockito to always undesirably return `this` with methods with generic return types when using `RETURNS_SELF`.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for mockito to check whether the return type of the method  is generic? In that case I would suggest a fix to never return `this` for methods with generic return types.\r\nIf you think this would be a good solution, I am happy to contribute a fix.\r\n\r\nedit: What do you think of checking whether return type is of type `Object.class`, which suggests that mockito should probable return the empty value instead of `this`\r\n\r\nedit 2: Added #2687 to demonstrate the issue with a test and solution proposal.
