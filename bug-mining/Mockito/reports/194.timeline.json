#1891 \r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the java bytecode generated by this project [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/). This means that under identical builds condition (for example Java version), repeated builds should provide the same output byte-for-byte.\r\n\r\nIt achieves this by:\r\n\r\n* using Gradle's [reproducible archives](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/working_with_files.html#sec:reproducible_archives) functionality to fix timestamps and file ordering within JARs\r\n* re-archiving JARs that are non-deterministic because they contain timestamps in their Manifests\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is best explained on the previously linked Reproducible Builds page.\r\n\r\n## Confirming the change\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n#!/bin/bash -e\r\n\r\nrm -f checksums*\r\n\r\n./gradlew clean build -x test --parallel\r\n\r\nfind . -name '*.jar' \\\r\n    | grep '/build/libs/' \\\r\n    | sort \\\r\n    | xargs sha256sum > checksums-1.txt\r\n\r\n./gradlew clean build -x test --parallel\r\n\r\nfind . -name '*.jar' \\\r\n    | grep '/build/libs/' \\\r\n    | sort \\\r\n    | xargs sha256sum > checksums-2.txt\r\n\r\ndiff checksums-1.txt checksums-2.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe diff should be empty, that is to say, both independent runs of the build should have generated byte-for-byte identical outputs, with the exception of the JavaDocs jars\r\n\r\n## Omitting Javadocs\r\n\r\nDespite Gradle allegedly supporting `noTimestamp` through [StandardJavadocDocletOptions](https://docs.gradle.org/5.3/javadoc/org/gradle/external/javadoc/StandardJavadocDocletOptions.html), I was unable to actually get this to work and remove the timestamped build comment in the javadoc. \r\n\r\nI'll happily fold this into the PR if I (or someone else) can get it to work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n - [x] Read the [contributing
