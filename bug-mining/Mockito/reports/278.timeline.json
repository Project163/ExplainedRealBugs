All our modules are setup to use Java 11.\r\n* We can't see StackWalker class from the IDE\r\n* This only happens on Android instrumental tests, not in \"normal\" java tests\r\n* The class StackWalker is not available in Android SDK java implementation: https://github.com/AndroidSDKSources/android-sdk-sources-for-api-level-33/tree/master/java/lang (that would explain why is not working only for instrumental tests, as they are executed on an Android device). Checked for latest android versions.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a very specific Android issue.\r\n\r\nFor the meantime, we will halt the upgrade, but any help will be great.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n - [x] The mockito message in the stacktrace have useful information, but it didn't help\r\n - [N/A] The problematic code (if that's possible) is copied here;\r\n       Note that some configuration are impossible to mock via Mockito\r\n - [x] Provide versions (mockito / jdk / os / any other relevant information)\r\n - [X] Provide a [Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable),

This could happen because the GitHub Actions runners might be shared between different jobs, and the emulator might be in a bad state when we try to use it. This sounds weird, because I'm sure GHA ensures a clean state, but not sure about it. Anyway, I haven't found any other suggestion than to kill the emulator and cold-boot it. Which is achieved by the default `-no-snapshot` flag. The only option I see here is to retry somehow.\r\n   \r\n   Fix: N/A so far, 🤞 `emulator-build` helps. \r\n   \r\n * <details><summary><code>Unknown failure: cmd: Failure calling service package: Broken pipe (32)</code></summary>\r\n   \r\n   [Job](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/actions/runs/4106655761/jobs/7085158611#step:4:496)\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   > Task :androidTest:connectedDebugAndroidTest\r\n   Exception thrown during onBeforeAll invocation of plugin com.google.testing.platform.plugin.android.AndroidDevicePlugin.\r\n   Failed to install APK(s): /Users/runner/work/mockito/mockito/subprojects/androidTest/build/outputs/apk/debug/androidTest-debug.apk\r\n   Unknown failure: cmd: Failure calling service package: Broken pipe (32)\r\n   com.android.ddmlib.InstallException: Unknown failure: cmd: Failure calling service package: Broken pipe (32)\r\n   \tat com.android.ddmlib.internal.DeviceImpl.installRemotePackage(DeviceImpl.java:1315)\r\n   \tat com.android.ddmlib.internal.DeviceImpl.installPackage(DeviceImpl.java:1141)\r\n   \tat com.android.tools.utp.plugins.deviceprovider.ddmlib.DdmlibAndroidDevice.installPackage(DdmlibAndroidDevice.kt)\r\n   \tat com.android.tools.utp.plugins.deviceprovider.ddmlib.DdmlibAndroidDeviceController$executeAsync$deferred$1.invokeSuspend(DdmlibAndroidDeviceController.kt:173)\r\n   \tat kotlin.coroutines.jvm.internal.BaseContinuationImpl.resumeWith(ContinuationImpl.kt:33)\r\n   \tat kotlinx.coroutines.DispatchedTask.run(DispatchedTask.kt:106)\r\n   \tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler.runSafely(CoroutineScheduler.kt:571)\r\n   \tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.executeTask(CoroutineScheduler.kt:750)\r\n   \tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.runWorker(CoroutineScheduler.kt:678)\r\n   \tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.run(CoroutineScheduler.kt:665)\r\n   \r\n   \r\n   > Task :androidTest:connectedDebugAndroidTest FAILED\r\n   ```\r\n   </details>\r\n   \r\n   Not a clue what's happening here, let's assume it's the \"same\" problem as above.\r\n   Retry might help in this case, but it's quite complex, not sure that we want to adopt this.\r\n   https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/develop/contrib/instrumentation.sh\r\n   \r\n   Fix: N/A so far, 🤞 `emulator-build` helps.\r\n   \r\n * <details><summary><code>Mockito cannot mock this class: interface org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInterface.</code></summary>\r\n   \r\n   [Job](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/actions/runs/4106511182/jobs/7085124984#step:4:674)\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   > Task :androidTest:connectedDebugAndroidTest\r\n   Starting 6 tests on test(AVD) - 13\r\n   \r\n   org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInstrumentedTests > mockAndUseBasicClassWithVerify[test(AVD) - 13] FAILED \r\n   \torg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException:\r\n   \tMockito cannot mock this class: interface org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInterface.\r\n   \r\n   org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInstrumentedTests > mockAndUseBasicClassUsingLocalMock[test(AVD) - 13] FAILED \r\n   \torg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException:\r\n   \tMockito cannot mock this class: interface org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInterface.\r\n   \r\n   org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInstrumentedTests > mockAndUseBasicInterfaceUsingAnnotatedMock[test(AVD) - 13] FAILED \r\n   \torg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException:\r\n   \tMockito cannot mock this class: interface org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInterface.\r\n   \r\n   org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInstrumentedTests > mockAndUseBasicClassUsingAnnotatedMock[test(AVD) - 13] FAILED \r\n   \torg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException:\r\n   \tMockito cannot mock this class: interface org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInterface.\r\n   \r\n   org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInstrumentedTests > mockAndUseBasicInterfaceAndVerify[test(AVD) - 13] FAILED \r\n   \torg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException:\r\n   \tMockito cannot mock this class: interface org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInterface.\r\n   \r\n   org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInstrumentedTests > mockAndUseBasicInterfaceUsingLocalMock[test(AVD) - 13] FAILED \r\n   \torg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException:\r\n   \tMockito cannot mock this class: interface org.mockitousage.androidtest.BasicInterface.\r\n   Tests on test(AVD) - 13 failed: There was 6 failure(s).\r\n   \r\n   > Task :androidTest:connectedDebugAndroidTest FAILED\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   </details>\r\n   \r\n   Undiagnosable as per https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2893#discussion_r1094978058.
