Very useful for complicated testing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I found that the verification collector doesn't work for verifications on method invocations with parameters. I had a quick check of the source code of the test, and I noticed that all of the tests in `VerificationCollectorImplTest` use no-arg invocations.\r\n\r\nHopefully this would be an easy fix, because this looks like an extremely useful feature for my application but I need to verify invocations with arguments. At the moment, my workaround is to wrap each verification call in an AssertJ soft assertion, but this makes writing the tests a bit more tedious and less readable.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1642/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
