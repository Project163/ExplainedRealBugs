With Mockito 2, we are applying more fine grained locking to improve concurrency. The difference is displayed in the stack trace where `findOrInsert` aquires a lock for the class loader of the mock class before creating a mock. The previous solution always aquired a global lock what made it impossible to create to mock classes concurrently.\r\n\r\nThe relevant part:\r\n\r\n```\r\nat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:404)\r\n- waiting to lock <0x00000007959e4a78> (a sbt.classpath.ClasspathUtilities$$anon$1)\r\nat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:411)\r\n- locked <0x0000000795a868e8> (a sbt.classpath.ClasspathFilter)\r\n\t\r\nat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:404)\r\n- waiting to lock <0x0000000795a868e8> (a sbt.classpath.ClasspathFilter)\r\nat net.bytebuddy.TypeCache.findOrInsert(TypeCache.java:161)\r\n- locked <0x00000007959e4a78> (a sbt.classpath.ClasspathUtilities$$anon$1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can it be that `sbt.classpath.ClasspathFilter` delegates to `sbt.classpath.ClasspathUtilities$$anon$1` where the latter apparently also reqires locking the former?

\r\n> Is there any project that I can build that reliably reproduces this?\r\n\r\nThis seems to be happening for every travis build for https://github.com/lucidsoftware/xtract\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't happen when I build locally.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce by building it in the travisci/ci-garnet:packer-1512502276-986baf0 docker image. Which is how I was able to get a thread dump and figure out that this is a likely cause.\r\n\r\nNow that I have identified what the problem probably is, I'll try to fix future builds, but a commit id that is broken is 1939ab6798c974e4238439d04ba54a71ece5c31c.\r\n\r\nFrom the thread dump, I think the applicable code is:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  private class PureXmlReader[T](result: T) extends XmlReader[T] {\r\n    def read(elem: scala.xml.NodeSeq): ParseResult[T] = ParseSuccess(result)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private class PartialSuccessXmlReader[T](result: T, errors: Seq[ParseError]) extends XmlReader[T] {\r\n    def read(elem: scala.xml.NodeSeq): ParseResult[T] = PartialParseSuccess(result, errors)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  def successXmlReader[T](result: T): XmlReader[T] =\r\n    spy(new PureXmlReader(result))\r\n\r\n  def partialSuccessXmlReader[T](result: T, errors: Seq[ParseError]): XmlReader[T] =\r\n    spy(new PartialSuccessXmlReader[T](result, errors))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems successXmlReader and partialSuccessXmlReader are being called simultaneously, and creating the spies concurrently results in a deadlock. The fact that both PureXmlReader and PartialSuccessXmlReader extend XmlReader is suspicious.\r\n\r\nI can give you the full thread dump if you want, but it is pretty similar to the original post.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/369143903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmccombs","id":2541726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDE3MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2541726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs","html_url":"https://github.com/tmccombs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1496075050,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQ5NjA3NTA1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1496075050","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-28T07:16:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1496075051,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0OTYwNzUwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1496075051","actor":{"login":"raphw","id":4489328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4489328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw","html_url":"https://github.com/raphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-28T07:16:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1498264061,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0OTgyNjQwNjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1498264061","actor":{"login":"tmccombs","id":2541726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDE3MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2541726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs","html_url":"https://github.com/tmccombs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"707f149fdd55820094a42686e5f79b318a5ae44a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lucidsoftware/xtract/commits/707f149fdd55820094a42686e5f79b318a5ae44a","created_at":"2018-03-01T05:27:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tmccombs","id":2541726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDE3MjY=",
