#2720.\r\n\r\nIn terms of memory allocations, this reduces the overall memory\r\nallocations of creating a Location by an order of magnitude in\r\nJava 9, and as compared to Java 8.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is somewhat involved due to these desires:\r\n\r\n- Minimize the amount of work done if the Location is never used. This\r\n  is done by not converting the StackFrame into a StackTraceElement,\r\n  instead wrapping in an intermediate type. The StackTraceElement conversion\r\n  will only occur (internally) if the .getFileName() method is called, which it usually isn't.\r\n- Ensure the implementation is still Serializable. This is ensured with\r\n  a .writeReplace method.\r\n- Minimize the number of allocations, which is basically an exercise in\r\n  lambda caching.\r\n- Ensuring the old mechanism still works on Java 8.\r\n- MethodHandles are even lower overhead than the reflection, but AnimalSniffer does\r\n  not like them since they don't exist in Android.\r\n\r\nPresently on Java 9+, on a stack depth of 1000 the old mechanism will allocate\r\n40kB of RAM per call. The new one will allocate 1.5kB of RAM per call,\r\nwhich is a huge improvement. Even in a very basic JUnit test with no stack depth,\r\nthe difference is about 1.5kB of allocation vs 8kB.\r\n\r\nThis is still sadly not the 'close-to-no-overhead' solution I was\r\nlooking for. I therefore also added a system property that can be used\r\nto fully disable Location creation. I'm aware that this is likely not\r\nthe right approach given Mockito has plugins and settings - mostly\r\nlooking for guidance here given I'm not sure what would be idiomatic\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n##
