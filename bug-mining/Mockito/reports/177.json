When run together from eclipse or mvn the second test `MockitoVoidMethodsUnitTest.whenAddCalledValueCaptured` fails but because of something detected in the other test:\r\n```\r\norg.mockito.exceptions.misusing.UnfinishedStubbingException: \r\nUnfinished stubbing detected here:\r\n-> at org.baeldung.mockito.misusing.MockitoMisusingUnitTest.givenNotASpy_whenDoReturn_thenThrowNotAMock(MockitoMisusingUnitTest.java:28)\r\n\r\nE.g. thenReturn() may be missing.\r\nExamples of correct stubbing:\r\n    when(mock.isOk()).thenReturn(true);\r\n    when(mock.isOk()).thenThrow(exception);\r\n    doThrow(exception).when(mock).someVoidMethod();\r\nHints:\r\n 1. missing thenReturn()\r\n 2. you are trying to stub a final method, which is not supported\r\n 3: you are stubbing the behaviour of another mock inside before 'thenReturn' instruction if completed\r\n\r\n-> at org.baeldung.mockito.MockitoVoidMethodsUnitTest.whenAddCalledValueCaptured(MockitoVoidMethodsUnitTest.java:30)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the call stack:\r\n```\r\nMockingProgressImpl.validateState() line: 109\t\r\nMockingProgressImpl.stubbingStarted() line: 98\t\r\nMockitoCore.stubber(Strictness) line: 179\t\r\nMockitoCore.stubber() line: 174\t\r\nMockito.doNothing() line: 2421\t\r\nMockitoVoidMethodsUnitTest.whenAddCalledValueCaptured() line: 30\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the method where it then fails inside `MockingProgress.java`:\r\n```java\r\npublic void validateState() {\r\n    validateMostStuff();\r\n\r\n    //validate stubbing:\r\n    if (stubbingInProgress != null) {\r\n        Location temp = stubbingInProgress;\r\n        stubbingInProgress = null;\r\n        throw unfinishedStubbing(temp);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is a bug, tests should be independent and not cause side affects on each other. Maybe something is not cleaned up properly between test runs.\r\n\r\nIf I add this tear down to `MockitoMisusingUnitTest` then it works ok:\r\n```java\r\n    @After\r\n    public void tearDown() {\r\n        ThreadSafeMockingProgress.mockingProgress().reset();\r\n    }\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't mind to have a go at fixing it, but I would need some help or hints. This was tested with the latest version 2.24.5.\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1655/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
