For non trivial method parameters, I often encounter the following ArgumentCaptor pattern:\r\n```java\r\nClassUnderTest classUnderTest = new ClassUnderTest(otherServiceMock);\r\n\r\nclassUnderTest.method();\r\n\r\nArgumentCaptor<Param> paramArgumentCaptor = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(Param.class);\r\nverify(otherServiceMock).doStuff(paramArgumentCaptor.capture());\r\nParam paramFromCaptor = paramArgumentCaptor.getValue();\r\nassertThat(paramFromCaptor.getField1()).isEqualTo(\"value1\");\r\nassertThat(paramFromCaptor.getField2()).isEqualTo(\"value2\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is fine, but a little bit verbose.\r\n\r\nAn alternative pattern I find myself using lately is using the `argThat` argument matcher to eliminate the captor, resulting in the verify statement looking something like this:\r\n```java\r\nverify(otherServiceMock).doStuff(argThat(param -> {\r\n    assertThat(param.getField1()).isEqualTo(\"value1\");\r\n    assertThat(param.getField2()).isEqualTo(\"value2\");\r\n    return true;\r\n}));\r\n```\r\nIn my opinion, at least in simple cases where only assertions on a single parameter are desired, this looks a little cleaner. Just the return statement is a bit pointless.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is adding an API that would allow eliminating the return statement in this pattern, for example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nverify(otherServiceMock).doStuff(assertArg(param -> {\r\n    assertThat(param.getField1()).isEqualTo(\"value1\");\r\n    assertThat(param.getField2()).isEqualTo(\"value2\");\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr is there already an API that would allow a similar pattern that I've missed?
