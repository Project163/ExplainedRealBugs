To continue support newer version of Mockito: \n- Repack [mockito-cglib](https://github.com/mockito/mockito-cglib) into Powermock mockito-api.

#613\n\nAs was suggested in [Mockito#248](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/248) I've repacked mockito-cglib into Powermock via creating a new module `powermock-api-mockito2`. Really, I did nothing, except copying `powermock-api-mockito`, putting `mockito-cglib` class into powermock and update build. \n\nAhh, of course I had to update `org.powermock.api.mockito.PowerMockito` to support API changes in the `org.mockito.Mockito`class. \nSame true for `org.powermock.api.mockito.internal.mockmaker.PowerMockMaker`.\n\n@bric3 and @raphw, could also review changes, please?\n\nI've added new Maven profile: mockito2. So nothing has been changed for users of Mockito 1 and nothing has been changed in build. But if run build with profile `mockito2` then several new artefacts will be built. And these artefact could be used by Mockito 2 users. All tests are passed for Mockito 2 build. Also I've checked new artefact with several other open source projects which use Powermock, and they tests have also have been passed. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/powermock/powermock/issues/614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/powermock/powermock/issues/614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
