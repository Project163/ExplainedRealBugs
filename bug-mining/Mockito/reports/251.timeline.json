Which leads to the following line returning `features.mockedType`:\r\n```java\r\nreturn subclassingRequired ? subclassEngine.mockClass(features) : features.mockedType;\r\n```\r\ninstead of calling the `subclassEngine` of type `TypeCachingBytecodeGenerator` with a byte generator of type `SubclassBytecodeGenerator`.\r\n\r\n`SubclassBytecodeGenerator` being the class modified in https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2207/ , I suspect the check for `isGroovyMethod` is never executed.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it seems like [`getMetaclass` is not marked with `@Internal`](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/src/main/java/groovy/lang/GroovyObject.java), so I'm not convinced the root cause is the same.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/1009154210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"temp-droid","id":82510451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTEwNDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82510451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid","html_url":"https://github.com/temp-droid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5867614440,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAF62v85AqCk9zwAAAAFdvLDo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/5867614440","actor":{"login":"stevegreenn","id":19478176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDc4MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19478176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn","html_url":"https://github.com/stevegreenn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-10T17:24:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5867614446,"node_id":"SE_lADOAF62v85AqCk9zwAAAAFdvLDu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/5867614446","actor":{"login":"stevegreenn","id":19478176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDc4MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19478176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn","html_url":"https://github.com/stevegreenn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevegreenn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-10T17:24:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/1011376058","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2522#issuecomment-1011376058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2522","id":1011376058,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAF62v848SF-6","user":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_a
