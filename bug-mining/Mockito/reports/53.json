By its nature these classes don't have a state. Currently some them are instance based in other word you need to create the utility class to call a helper method. This not only pollutes the heap but also the code cause instance methods can't be imported statically. \r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nHelper helper = new Helper();\r\nif (helper.isInputValid(input)){\r\n  [...] \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs. static import of Helper.isInputValid\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (isInputValid(input)){\r\n  [...] \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe aim of this ticket is to identify canidates that can be refactored to static utility classes.
