#2389 \"Parallel use of mocks with deep stubbing may lead to ConcurrentModificationException\"\r\n\r\nThe issue was that ReturnsDeepStubs (line 82) retrieved the existings stubbings via `InvocationContainerImpl::getStubbingsDescending`, and iterating on it to find existing stubbings resulted in a `ConcurrentModificationException` because other threads were adding their own `Answer` to the stubbings list (`InvocationContainerImpl::addAnswer` called at `ReturnsDeepStubs` line 150).\r\n\r\nAll of the methods in `InvocationContainerImpl` that mutate the `LinkedList<StubbedInvocationMatcher> stubbed` field are synchronized on `stubbed`, but the getters aren't (`getStubbingsAscending` and `getStubbingsDescending`). I added a `InvocationMatcherImpl::findStubbedAnswer` that does basically what `ReturnsDeepStubs` used to do, but synchronizing on `stubbed`.\r\n\r\nSomebody had been there before and had noticed there was something weird, because there was a TODO in the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// TODO why don't we do container.findAnswer here?\r\n```\r\nHowever, I tried that in my original solution (using `findAnswerFor()`), but it didn't work because it used the `matches()` method from the elements of `stubbed`, which don't have the matchers from `verify()` (see test and debugger screenshots below).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22927506/137038686-658da098-14a6-4967-978e-1291fa7a6392.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22927506/137038640-c43df08f-7388-411e-a381-f64332fd9b69.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI also added a test for regressions.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: described new
