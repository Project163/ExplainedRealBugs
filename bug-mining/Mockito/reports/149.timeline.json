What you were trying to do\r\n\r\nRun all unit tests in the `engine-tests` project with Java 10 on a Mac\r\n\r\n### What actually happened\r\n\r\nAbout 200 tests failed, seemingly with well-known Mockito compatibility issues on newer Javas. See for instance https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1419\r\n\r\nI suspect we might just have to keep an eye on this but in the meantime could probably try to update to the very latest Mockito anyway so long as it doesn't break anything (at least on Java 8)\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n* Run the engine unit test with Java 10 or 11\r\n* Try varying the version of Mockito in the `build.gradle file in `engine-tests` to `2.23.0` - for me that cuts it down to about 6 broken tests, still at least some are Mockito related  \r\n\r\n### Computer details\r\n\r\n* MacOS Mojave update
