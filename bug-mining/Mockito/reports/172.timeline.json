am preparing a repo that shows the issue (it may take a couple of days), but if both mockito and selenium are used in a single pom.xml, selenium 3.141.59's dependency on byte-buddy 1.8.15 causes that version of byte-buddy to be used instead of the version required by mockito.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/473263426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rhwood","id":297232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzIzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/297232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood","html_url":"https://github.com/rhwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhwood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/473371126","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1606#issuecomment-473371126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1606","id":473371126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzM3MTEyNg==","user":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T17:15:56Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T17:15:56Z","body":"I am not sure what we on the Mockito team can do about that. If Maven resolves to a dependency that does not satisfy the constraints we declare in our pom, that seems like an issue of Maven. We need at least ByteBuddy 1.9.7. If a different dependency requires a lower version, I think you need to resolve that in your `pom.xml` by explicitly declaring the version of ByteBuddy.\r\n\r\nPer https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Scope I am not sure what other scope is more appropriate over `compile`. We need ByteBuddy during compilation to define our MockMaker and therefore we also need to use it when running any
