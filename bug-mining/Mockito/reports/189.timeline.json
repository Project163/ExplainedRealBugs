@mockitoguy @andreisilviudragnea, I think this PR has introduced a new bug (or a regression if you like).\r\n\r\nThe problem arises when using Deep Stubs, as every call in a deep stub counts as used stubbing, but if you end up stubbing that mock for real this change will change the state of the original stubbing and your test will fail with an `UnnecessaryStubbingException`\r\n\r\nThe following example is in Scala, I don't have a running Java project at hand, but I can provide a 100% Java example if this is not enough to explain the problem\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  class Foo {\r\n    def userClass: Bar = {...}\r\n  }\r\n  class Bar {\r\n    def callMeMaybe: Baz = {...}\r\n  }\r\n  class Baz {\r\n    def callMe: Option[String] = {...}\r\n  }\r\n\r\nval aFoo = mock[Foo](DefaultAnswers.ReturnsDeepStubs)\r\naFoo.userClass.callMeMaybe.callMe returns Some(\"my number\")\r\naFoo.userClass.callMeMaybe.callMe.value shouldBe \"my number\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat code will fail as there are 2 stubbings for `callMe`, one automatically created by the deep stub (see `ReturnsDeepStubs.class` line 67) and one for the actual stubbing I'm making to return `Some(\"my number\")`.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/590001890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ultrasecreth","id":241804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTgwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/241804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth","html_url":"https://github.com/ultrasecreth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrasecreth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3063003746,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA2MzAwMzc0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/3063003746","actor":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-22T21:53:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3063003747,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNjMwMDM3NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/3063003747","actor":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-22T21:53:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3063003749,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA2MzAwMzc0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/3063003749","actor":{"login":"andreisilviudragnea","id":8200650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDA2NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8200650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea","html_url":"https://github.com/andreisilviudragnea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreisilviudragnea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"co
