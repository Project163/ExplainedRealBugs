The library messes with the type structure. The method in question looks like this:\n\n``` java\n@WithBridgeMethods({void.class})\npublic GHIssueComment comment(String message) throws IOException\n```\n\nThis makes it impossible for Byte Buddy to build bridge methods as they are required by the Java-specification. A `void` type can simply not be assigned to a `GHIssueComment` type. cglib \"solved\" this problem by ignoring bridge methods alltogether but all in all, there is no good solution to this. The mocked class is simply not legal Java code.\n\nI need to look into a better bridge method building mechanism without breaking the type validation. The problem is also the use of adapter methods; Byte Buddy would not know how to convert bridged types.

as discussed here: https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/3869 and implemented since 2.2.2 (https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/3911/files), the removal of the final modifier would allow mocking Realm without the use of PowerMock. Needless to say, after spending so much time trying to make Realm + PowerMock + Roboelectric work (and failing to do so), I was ecstatic to hear about aforementioned changes. But...\n\nIt was still impossible to mock Realm.class:\n`Mockito.mock(Realm.class)` would end up\n```\norg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException: \nMockito cannot mock this class: class io.realm.Realm.\n\nMockito can only mock non-private & non-final classes.\nIf you're not sure why you're getting this error, please report to the mailing list.\n\n\nJava               : 1.8\nJVM vendor name    : Oracle Corporation\nJVM vendor version : 25.112-b15\nJVM name           : Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM\nJVM version        : 1.8.0_112-b15\nJVM info           : mixed mode\nOS name            : Windows 7\nOS version         : 6.1\n```\n\nMy guess is it's because Realm.class still has a private constructor.\n\nAm I doing something wrong and there is a more elaborate way to set things up? Is there still a way to mock stuff without PowerMock? If not, what is the point of https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/3911/files change?\n\nThings I used in my code: \n- `io.realm:realm-gradle-plugin:2.3.0-SNAPSHOT`\n- `org.mockito:mockito-core:2.4.0`\n- `com.google.dagger:dagger:2.8`\n- `org.robolectric:robolectric:3.1.4`\n\nOh, and all the production and test code is written in Kotlin.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/realm/realm-java/issues/3937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/realm/realm-java/issues/3937/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Haarolean","id":1494347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTQzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1494347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean","html_url":"https://github.com/Haarolean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haarolean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-09T10:21:57Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T10:21:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hub4j/github-api/issues/1739","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hub4j/github-api","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hub4j/github-api/issues/1739/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hub4j/github-api/issues/1739/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hub4j/github-api/issues/1739/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hub4j/github-api/issues/1739","id":1985297242,"node_id":"I_kwDOAAlq-s52VTta","number":1739,"title":"Unable
