right, the information is scattered throughout a couple of GitHub issues, but let's summarize the changes we want to make for Mockito 5:\r\n\r\n- [x] Change default mockmaker to inline mockmaker (#2589)\r\n- [x] Update minimum Java version to 11 (#2798)\r\n- [x] Add `type()` method to `ArgumentMatcher` to fix vararg integration (#2807)\r\n- [x] Remove internal `VarargsMatcher` (#2835)\r\n\r\nI propose that we do not include any other breaking changes, as I think these two will already have a large impact. Since I would like our users to be able to upgrade to the latest version of Mockito, even with breaking changes, I think these bumps are already sufficiently large.\r\n\r\nPlease see the linked GitHub issues for a status update on what we need to do.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/1328261554","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798#issuecomment-1328261554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2798","id":1328261554,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAF62v85PK6my","user":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-27T14:44:14Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T21:24:03Z","body":"I filed #2802 to consolidate the changes for Mockito 5. For this issue, we will need to:\r\n\r\n- [x] Bump our minimum Java version to 11 specified here: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/0ce902af967cca91cb9ff2beaac95e44406bd175/gradle/java-library.gradle#L17-L18\r\n- [x] Additionally, we can look into remove our JavaDoc hack (https://github.com/mockito/mockito/tree/main/gradle/mockito-core/java-8-docs) which effectively reverts #2766\r\n- [x] We need to update our version of JavaDoc here: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/0ce902af967cca91cb9ff2beaac95e44406bd175/gradle/mockito-core/javadoc.gradle#L48\r\n- [x] Remove 8 from our build matrix: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/0ce902af967cca91cb9ff2beaac95e44406bd175/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L32\r\n- [x] Update all matrix checks to run on 11 instead: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/0ce902af967cca91cb9ff2beaac95e44406bd175/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L51\r\n- [x] Remove all checks in `.gradle` files that check for Version 8 explicitly: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/0ce902af967cca91cb9ff2beaac95e44406bd175/subprojects/module-test/module-test.gradle#L5\r\n- [x] Remove all checks in `.gradle` files that check if we are Java 9 compatible: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/0ce902af967cca91cb9ff2beaac95e44406bd175/subprojects/inline/inline.gradle#L17\r\n\r\nWe can clean up the source code in `src/main/java` to remove all reflection usages (and thus solve this ticket) in Mockito 5.1.0. I would prefer to make it a clean cut first, so that upgrading is relatively straightforward. Then fixes go in a minor release, so that we can catch regressions separately.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you think I missed something. I would welcome some PRs to get these fixed!","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/1328261554/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7897655892,"node_id":"LE_lADOAF62v85XJHfmzwAAAAHWvKpU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/7897655892","actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-27T14:44:20Z","label":{"name":"please
