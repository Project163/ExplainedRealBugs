Introduces koin-test for mocking Repository instances in functional tests.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOur UI tests normally connect to live backend since they use the default implementation. That brings about some things to consider: \r\n- if we use one e-mail to complete the registration flow, then it'll be _really_ registered, and we won't be able to run the same tests with the same e-mail for the 2nd time, backend will complain that the it is already registered. \r\n- with a live backend, we would be testing the backend itself too. so, if there are any problems w/ the backend, our tests would fail too, which creates a false-negative outcome. this might not be what we want.\r\n- on the other hand, a live backend frees us from the burden of mocking network requests and imitating the real behaviour from screen to screen.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I made a very primitive mocking mechanism with koin-test. It uses Mockito to mock Repository instances. There is a limitation here: we hit the \"Mockito cannot mock final classes\" problem again with Mockito & Kotlin. However, [for androidTests, MockMaker fix does not work](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1855#issuecomment-615916402), so we need to mock the Repository interface altogether, instead of concrete final RemoteDataSource class (which is our main problem). A solution to this problem would be to hide the RemoteDataSource behind an interface as well, but that sort of creates an unnecessary layer in production code.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wireapp/wire-android/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wireapp/wire-android/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/658801780","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1855#issuecomment-658801780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1855","id":658801780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODgwMTc4MA==","user":{"login":"glend1","id":8122900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjI5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8122900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1","html_url":"https://github.com/glend1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glend1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-15T14:28:09Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T14:28:09Z","body":"@TimvdLippe What should people do for android then?
