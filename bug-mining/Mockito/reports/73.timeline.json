Remove the betas from Maven central\n- Find a way to avoid releasing betas on Maven central\n\nActual comment:\n\nI don't read release notes, I don't participate in Mockito stuff. All I do is read the Javadoc. For more than a year, now, as someone who creates new projects every few days, I get pretty annoyed by the bad release management you've used. Maybe it's me, maybe it's you, I don't know. But I don't find this clean. At all.\n\nHere's what Netbeans suggest me when I'm selecting Mockito's version.\n\n![mockito-betas-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/666970/18350161/f7c71918-75d4-11e6-943a-fb772efb9c3d.png)\n\nOh, no final version on the first screen... Okay, let's scroll down.\n\n![mockito-betas-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/666970/18350170/fee7123e-75d4-11e6-9145-8b1c2d2d126d.png)\n\nWhat? I have to scroll down to the bottom 20% to find a stable version? Wait, is that a 2.1.0 beta? did I pass the 2.0.0 version? I just can't say. _scroll, scroll_. Ok, I didn't miss it: it's not yet released. But then, why do I see the 2.1.0 beta already? Shouldn't that even be alpha? I just don't know.\n\nThat means that roughly 80% of the versions given on Maven central are betas. Do you really think that this should go on? You guys have done some of the best API design when it comes to Mockito. But when it's about the release, the result is really subpar, for betas that no one will never ever use anymore.\n\nYou should ask sonatype to remove all those beta versions. As a user of what you do, I don't care about beta (maybe the last 2-3 beta versions to check what's new, but no more).\n\n> Do you remember guys the quite recent \"troubles\" with quite popular JavaScript library removed from node.js repo?\n\nThis was a production library. Here, the original idea is to remove betas.\n\nTo avoid this in the future, please, please, fix the publishing to Maven central. Recently there has been in average roughly one release per day on Maven central. Don't release the betas there. Nothing actually forbids you to do so, but look at the mess in the two screenshots. Why not create a private repo for testing? Can't this be hosted in a specific branch on GitHub? (a repo is just a folder, right?)\n\nI humbly ask you to do so for all of your users, for us who love what you've done so far.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/245596384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ogregoire","id":666970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Njk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire","html_url":"https://github.com/ogregoire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogregoire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
