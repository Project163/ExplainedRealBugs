I was reviewing @moltmann's PR and I'm wondering what are the alternative options to solve the problem. Can we attach a state to the mock object so that MockMakers can do their magic without keeping weak maps of all mocks? @raphw,

I see my mockmaker to be used to a legacy test suites though as they want to just mock one final method and not create a new test suite. Some older suites might not use junit or any other fancy feature.\r\n\r\nHence I would like to find a solution that does not require any changes outside of mockito.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/368593141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"moltmann","id":20428192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI4MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20428192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann","html_url":"https://github.com/moltmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1492633538,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQ5MjYzMzUzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1492633538","actor":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-26T18:05:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1492633539,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0OTI2MzM1Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1492633539","actor":{"login":"mockitoguy","id":24743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy","html_url":"https://github.com/mockitoguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockitoguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-26T18:05:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1492684976,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0OTI2ODQ5NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1492684976","actor":{"login":"moltmann","id":20428192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI4MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20428192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann","html_url":"https://github.com/moltmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moltmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c0ad83a2dd94a41bdde2cf3549a2e59416e7f5b6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moltmann/mockito/commits/c0ad83a2dd94a41bdde2cf3549a2e59416e7f5b6","created_at":"2018-02-26T18:31
