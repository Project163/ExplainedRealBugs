Byte Buddy requires stable names for fields that cache a value. I considered that using the hash of a `Method` would be good enough as those hashes should not collide.\r\n\r\nTurns out that for your exact signature, due to the complementary use of X and Y in both methods, the hash calculation of `java.lang.reflect.Method` yields the exact same hash code. I need to add a check to Byte Buddy which assures that a new name is found if such a collision occurs.\r\n\r\nThis is primary because of the poor choice of hashing in the JVM but it is a really rare case despite the hash function.
