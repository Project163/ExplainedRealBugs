While looking that up, I discovered that we do ship [`lenient()`](https://javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.5.1/org/mockito/MockSettings.html#lenient()), but we don't ship an equivalent API to set the strictness to `STRICT_STUBS`. I consider that a deficiency of the API, for which we should add an option. Therefore, +1 to this feature request.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, we shouldn't have shipped `mockSettings.lenient()`, but instead add `mockSettings.strictness(Strictness)`. We have the same issue with `@Mock`: https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mock.html#lenient()\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose we update both `MockSettings` and `@Mock` to accept a new setting called `strictness` which sets the `Strictness`. We can then deprecate both `lenient()` options, as they would be a shortcut for `strictness(Strictness.LENIENT)`.\r\n\r\n@sivaprasadreddy Would you like to contribute this feature to

Changes\r\n- **mockito: 4.4.0 -> 4.6.1** (https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases)\r\nMost important updates:\r\n  - Regression? Strictness set in @MockitoSettings ignored after upgrade from 4.5.1 to 4.6.0 https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2656\r\n  - Fixes https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2648 : Add support for customising strictness via @mock annotation and MockSettings https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2650\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why is this change needed?\r\n### Update 1\r\nAccording to the [Mockito documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#when(T)) :\r\n> Although it is possible to verify a stubbed invocation, usually it's just redundant. Let's say you've stubbed foo.bar(). If your code cares what foo.bar() returns then something else breaks(often before even verify() gets executed). If your code doesn't care what get(0) returns then it should not be stubbed. \r\n\r\nWhile working on the [Replace EasyMock and PowerMock with Mockito for StreamsMetricsImplTest ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12947) I noticed that described behavior wasn't applied when you create a new `mock` like this.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        final Metrics metrics = mock(Metrics.class);\r\n        when(metrics.metric(metricName)).thenReturn(null);\r\n\r\n        ... invoke SUT\r\n\r\n        verify(metrics).metric(metricName); // this should be redundant (according to docs)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter further investigation I figured out that described behaviour wasn't implemented until`v4.6.1`.\r\n\r\nWith this change we are now able to mock objects like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   Foo explicitStrictMock = mock(Foo.class, withSettings().strictness(Strictness.STRICT_STUBS));\r\n```\r\n- link to docs: [MockSettings.html#strictness](https://javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.6.1/org/mockito/quality/Strictness.html#STRICT_STUBS)\r\n\r\n### Update 2\r\nIt looks like I can accomplish the same thing by using the `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.StrictStubs.class)\r\n` instead of the `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)` so mockito dependency version update is not mandatory, but it would be nice to stay up-to-date and use the latest version (it's up to MR reviewer to decide if we are going to merge this now, or just close the MR and update mockito version later).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer
