If a project is still relying on Java 8 (or 9, or 10), they cannot benefit from any new fixes or features without upgrading their Java version, unless those same changes are backported to 4.x.y and released (or they want to fork and package Mockito themselves).\r\n\r\nGiven that, it'd be nice to know what the project's official policy on backporting is. Based on recent releases, it doesn't seem like backporting is common (the last release on the 4.x.y line is 4.11.0, which was published in December 2022, a month or so before 5.0.0, which was published in January 2023).\r\n\r\nAssuming this practice is intentional but undocumented, a short note added to the README (or possibly CONTRIBUTING?) doc stating that 4.x.y is no longer maintained and no new features, fixes, or security patches will be applied to it could be valuable.","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3087/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
