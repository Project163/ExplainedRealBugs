New Features in JUnit 5\r\n\r\nThe JUnit Jupiter extension model in JUnit 5 introduces support for constructor and method parameter resolution (i.e., dependency injection).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, third parties can implement the `ParameterResolver` extension API to inject dependencies, mocks, etc. into constructors and methods. In addition, the `TestInstancePostProcessor` extension API can be implemented to post-process a test instance (e.g., to perform field injection).\r\n\r\n## Status Quo\r\n\r\nMockito supports _field injection_ for mocks via the `@Mock` annotation. In addition, #438 allows `@Mock` to be declared on parameters for constructors and methods which makes `@Mock` support an ideal candidate for both the `TestInstancePostProcessor` and `ParameterResolver` extension APIs in JUnit Jupiter. In fact, the JUnit Team has already developed a proof of concept: see the `MockitoExtension` in the [junit5-mockito-extension](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/tree/master/junit5-mockito-extension) sample project.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce an official `MockitoExtension` for JUnit Jupiter to replace the proof of concept from the JUnit team.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/445/reactions","total_count":35,"+1":35,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/358591527","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1232#issuecomment-358591527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1232","id":358591527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODU5MTUyNw==","user":{"login":"ChristianSchwarz","id":1437411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzc0MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristianSchwarz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianSchwarz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-18T09:40:44Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T09:40:44Z","body":"Related discussion from #1221 \r\n----\r\n\r\n@TimvdLippe https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/445#issuecomment-357918936\r\n> Regarding #1232: another option would be to not support nesting of test classes. I think we actively have to consider this option, given our public API was apparently coupled to the JUnit4 implementation and we can not ship breaking changes per our policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n@marcphilipp https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/445#issuecomment-358106441\r\n> Well, it's @Incubating so you could still change it, right? 😉\r\n> \r\n> Besides, I think neither of the two proposals would break compatibility, would they? But then again, we should discuss this over at #1232. 🙂\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n@TimvdLippe https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/445#issuecomment-358286590\r\n> Hm, looking at it again, it seems that the breaking change is actually in an internal API, namely TestFinishedEvent, which is created in MockitoSession. As such, I think we should be okay actually. I will do a proper investigation this weekend (hopefully, else next week) and update #1221. I hope you are okay with that @ChristianSchwarz ? Once that is done, I can more definitively say the impact on our API and whether we are risking a breaking change. I have good hopes now we might actually dodge that.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n@marcphilipp https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/445#issuecomment-358407562\r\n> `TestFinishedEvent.getTestClassInstance()` and `TestFinishedEvent.getTestMethodName()` are currently only used (twice) like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> String testName = event.getTestClassInstance().getClass().getSimpleName() \r\n>                   + \".\" + event.getTestMethodName();\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> Currently, `DefaultMockitoSession `always uses null for `TestFinishedEvent.getTestMethodName() `which strikes me as odd. I think it would be better if TestFinishedEvent only had two methods: `getFailure()` and getTestName(). Then, MockitoSessionBuilder could get a testName(String) builder method and DefaultMockitoSessionBuilder could pass it to DefaultMockitoSession and so on.\r\n> \r\n> Alternatively, `MockitoSessionBuilder `could get a `testMethodName()` builder method and pass that on.\r\n> \r\n> Moreover, I think `MockitoSessionBuilder `should allow to configure a `MockitoLogger`. This way, frameworks like JUnit could pass in a custom implementation. For JUnit Jupiter, a `MockitoLogger `that publishes report entries instead of writing to stdout (which causes problems will parallel execution) comes to mind.\r\n> \r\n>

guys! What's the next step for closing this issue getting us closer to supporting JUnit5?\r\n\r\n@ChristianSchwarz - can you update the ticket and clarify the public API change? Do you suggest adding new \"initMock()\" method? Do you suggest vararg, or consecutive invocation, or both? I would suggest to go for the simplest compatible API change - keeping the existing method, just making it vararg. Will you be able to work on this?\r\n\r\n@marcphilipp - thank you for suggestions! For internal refactorings, we are pretty open - do what you think is good for the codebase. For public API changes/additions, we push back by default and we make sure that the use case is very
