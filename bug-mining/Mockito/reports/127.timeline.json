guide](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nNote: This is related to a fix listed in issue #1155 and fixed in pull request #1162 \r\n\r\nI wanted to point out how that bug-fix affects development with RXJava. For anyone who is using RXJava - that fix forced a lot of changes in the code, that are not desirable. Forcing the function definition to state that it throws leads to code smells and try catch blocks that don't really do anything, as exception handling is implemented inside RXJava.\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\nI have a class that returns an Observable, for let's say updating my users password, however the function may throw if the server returns an error code:\r\n\r\n**UpdatePassword.java**\r\n```\r\nfinal public class UpdatePassword extends Interactor<Boolean, UpdatePassword.Params> {\r\n    private AccountService accountService;\r\n\r\n    @Inject\r\n    public UpdatePassword(SchedulerProvider schedulerProvider, AccountService accountService) {\r\n        super(schedulerProvider);\r\n        this.accountService = accountService;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Observable<Boolean> observable(Params params) {\r\n        return accountService.updatePassword(params);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AccountService.java**\r\n```\r\npublic class AccountService extends BaseService {\r\n\\* (...) *\\\r\n        public Observable<Boolean> updatePassword(UpdatePassword.Params params) {\r\n        return accountApi.updatePassword(new ApiRequestBody<>(params))\r\n            .map(response -> {\r\n                if (response.errorCode > 0 && response.messageKey != null) {\r\n                    throw new ApiException(response.message, response.errorCode, response.messageKey);\r\n                }\r\n                return response.status == 200;\r\n            })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code would be called in the following way: \r\n```\r\nUpdatePassword updatePassword;\r\n\\* (...) *\\\r\n\r\n@OnClick(R.id.update_password_button) void onUpdateButtonClick() {\r\n\r\nupdatePassword.observable(params).subscribe(\r\n    passwordUpdated -> {\r\n        if (passwordUpdated) { \r\n            /* (...) */\r\n        }\r\n    }, throwable -> { // Here is where code handles Observables Exception \r\n        if (throwable instanceof ApiException) {\r\n            /* (...) */\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            view.onError(throwable.getMessage());\r\n        }\r\n    }, this::hideLoadingScreen);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this was my test scenario (all I'm doing is mocking the AccountService and make sure that the UpdatePassword indeed calls the method from injected AccountService):\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class UpdatePasswordTest {\r\n\r\n    private TestSchedulerProvider testSchedulerProvider = new TestSchedulerProvider();\r\n    private AccountService mockAccountService;\r\n    private AppConfig mockAppConfig;\r\n    private UpdatePassword updatePassword;\r\n    private Boolean isUpdated = true;\r\n    private UpdatePassword.Params testParams;\r\n\r\n    @Before\r\n    public void setup() {\r\n        mockAccountService = mock(AccountService.class);\r\n        mockAppConfig = mock(AppConfig.class);\r\n\r\n        testParams = new UpdatePassword.Params(mockAppConfig, \"oldPassword\",\"newPassword\", \"confirmPassword\");\r\n\r\n        when(mockAccountService.updatePassword(any()))\r\n                .thenReturn(Observable.just(isUpdated))\r\n                .thenThrow(ApiException.class);\r\n        updatePassword = new UpdatePassword(testSchedulerProvider, mockAccountService);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void test_passwordUpdateObservable_returnsTrue() {\r\n        Observable<Boolean> passwordObservable = updatePassword.observable(testParams);\r\n        TestObserver<Boolean> testObserver = passwordObservable.test();\r\n\r\n        testObserver.assertNoErrors();\r\n        testObserver.assertValue(isUpdated);\r\n        testObserver.assertComplete();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test (expected = ApiException.class)\r\n    public void test_passwordUpdateObservable_throws() {\r\n        TestObserver<Boolean> testObserver = new TestObserver<>();\r\n\r\n        updatePassword.observable(testParams).subscribeWith(testObserver);\r\n        updatePassword.observable(testParams).subscribeWith(testObserver);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe above scenario works great with mockito version **2.8.47**, but fails, when using any higher version.\r\n\r\nSo if I update mockito to e.g. **2.11.0**, after running tests I get the error below\r\n```\r\norg.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException: \r\nChecked exception is invalid for this method!\r\n```\r\nwhich forces me to update the definition of `updatePassword` function in `AccountService` class, which forces to update the definition of `observable` function for every single class that extends the `Interactor`, when in reality there's only a few classes that do throw. Moreover, now I have to wrap the call to get the observable inside of the @OnClick into try/catch block, but I'm not planning on catching anything, since the RXJava's **throwable** piece is taking care of that. Also, those changes trickle down to having the following test case scenario:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class UpdatePasswordTest {\r\n\r\n    private TestSchedulerProvider testSchedulerProvider = new TestSchedulerProvider();\r\n    private AccountService mockAccountService;\r\n    private AppConfig mockAppConfig;\r\n    private UpdatePassword updatePassword;\r\n    private Boolean isUpdated = true;\r\n    private UpdatePassword.Params testParams;\r\n\r\n    @Before\r\n    public void setup() {\r\n        mockAccountService = mock(AccountService.class);\r\n        mockAppConfig = mock(AppConfig.class);\r\n\r\n        testParams = new UpdatePassword.Params(mockAppConfig, \"oldPassword\",\"newPassword\", \"confirmPassword\");\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            when(mockAccountService.updatePassword(any()))\r\n                    .thenReturn(Observable.just(isUpdated))\r\n                    .thenThrow(ApiException.class);\r\n            updatePassword = new UpdatePassword(testSchedulerProvider, mockAccountService);\r\n        } catch (Exception e) { }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void test_passwordUpdateObservable_returnsTrue() {\r\n        try {\r\n            Observable<Boolean> passwordObservable = updatePassword.observable(testParams);\r\n            TestObserver<Boolean> testObserver = passwordObservable.test();\r\n\r\n            testObserver.assertNoErrors();\r\n            testObserver.assertValue(isUpdated);\r\n            testObserver.assertComplete();\r\n        }\r\n        catch(Exception e) { }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test (expected = ApiException.class)\r\n    public void test_passwordUpdateObservable_throws() {\r\n        try {\r\n            TestObserver<Boolean> testObserver = new TestObserver<>();\r\n\r\n            updatePassword.observable(testParams).subscribeWith(testObserver);\r\n            updatePassword.observable(testParams).subscribeWith(testObserver);\r\n        }\r\n        catch(Exception e) { }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe compiler basically forced me to add all those try/catch blocks, otherwise my code wouldn't compile, since observable was marked as throwing.\r\n\r\nSo basically whoever wants to use the **unchecked exceptions as a feature**, should use mockito version **2.8.47**, because any higher than that, tests would start failing.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why I wanted to ask whether it would be possible to add **thenThrowUnchecked** function to mocks, that would preserve the old (and **highly desired** by project I'm working on) behavior.\r\n\r\nI would love to be able to define that my mockAccountService throws an unchecked exception.\r\ne.g. like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhen(mockAccountService.updatePassword(any()))\r\n                    .thenReturn(Observable.just(isUpdated))\r\n                    .thenThrowUnchecked(ApiException.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany thanks if you've read until the end ;)

What does this PR do?\r\nUpgrade to new dependency mockito-testng\r\nFixied issue in code related to this changes in mockito\r\n- thenThrow(Class) should only throw checked exceptions that match the signature of the stubbed method (https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1155)\r\n- Cleaner code for Mockito users by better integration with static code checkers, more @CheckReturnValue (https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1270)\r\n- Add @CheckReturnValue to stubbing/verification methods (https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1228)\r\n- Removed usused stubs from test classes (stubbed methods that would never be invoked during test executions).\r\n- In some cases, stubs would be counted as unused, when one is declared for multiple tests in @BeforeMethod, and at least one of the tests ends up not invoking the stubbed method. Usual solution to that is disabling strict checking for that stub using static method lenient(), or moving/removing stubs.\r\n- In case when same method would be stubbed with when().then() (but with different arguments), an exception will occur about unnecessary duplicated. To fix that, stubbing were reworked into doReturn().when().\r\n- In other cases, when stubbing is intentionally declared, but not invoked, a lenient() method is used.\r\n\r\nMerge state\r\n\r\n\r\n###
