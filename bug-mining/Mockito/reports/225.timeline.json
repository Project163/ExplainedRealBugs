updating from `3.11.2` to `3.12.0` (and getting similar errors on `3.12.1`), I have seen some strange sometimes-reproducible verification failures on Mockito for tests which previously passed consistently.\r\n\r\nI can't yet establish a pattern or simple reproduction; it feels like it is somehow dependent on the order of test evaluation/usage with respect to other tests within the same JVM instance, and I have been unable to replicate locally.\r\n\r\nThere are two main classes I am seeing\r\n\r\n1. mocks with interactions being tracked (and thus failing `verifyNoInteractions(mock)` after being put into `HashSet`s (these did not seem to previously count as an interaction, and usually do not)\r\n    ```\r\n

have a handful of other examples too in different classes.\r\n\r\nThis could be confirmation bias, however since I saw some stuff was done with respect to hashCodes in #2331 I wondered if it could be related. Logging it here to see if anyone else has seen any similar weirdness or might know what is going on.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n- Currently I _cannot_ replicate locally (MacOS Big Sur w/AdoptOpenJDK `15.0.2`) even where it is replicable on build/CI automation environment.\r\n- The failures seem to be (somewhat) reproducible on AL2 Linux w/ Oracle JDK `15.0.1`) but I cannot distinguish a pattern, and sometimes a different combination/ordering of tests does not seem to yield the same failure on exactly the same test
