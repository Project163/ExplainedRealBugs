The issue also occurs when using `Mockito.spy()` directly instead of the `@Spy` annotation. Example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)\r\nclass GenericSpyFailingTest {\r\n\r\n  // Removing this spy makes the test pass.\r\n  @Spy\r\n  private final List<String> genericSpy = List.of(\"item A\", \"item B\");\r\n\r\n  @Spy\r\n  private ExampleRecord exampleRecord = new ExampleRecord(\"some value\");\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  void exampleServiceUsesDependency() {\r\n    // The mocked record has all attributes set to null\r\n    // despite being explicitly defined.\r\n    assertNotNull(exampleRecord.someParameter());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [the example repo](https://github.com/matej-staron/mockito-junit-examples) with tests to reproduce.\r\n\r\nAny idea why this happens? I couldn't find any mention of limitations related to using `@Spy` with generics.\r\n\r\nThis was originally encountered while using `mockito-inline` and an older Mockito version, but it is also reproducible with the latest `mockito-core`, as shown in the linked repo.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated!","closed_by":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/3160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
