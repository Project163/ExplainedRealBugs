read in [#952](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/952) that examples in interfaces AnswerX(Answer1, Answer2, etc.) and VoidAnswerX do not work. Thanks to an example correction by  Christian Schwarz in  the comment of the issue, I made some modifications in those files. If this is of any help, I'd be so happy! But do not hesitate to tell me if I did anything wrong! Sorry up front if I bring any inconvenience to you!\r\n\r\nBelow are some thoughts of mine during and after the correction work:  \r\n- I've tried those examples in my own simple tests, luckily they all work fine. \r\n- I noticed that Christian also gave an example on using the interface with lambda expression. I've also worked out the \"lambda\" versions regarding AnswerX interfaces but not with VoidAnswerX(at least not with the same case, the throwing exception usage, in the current example). So I decide not to include the lambda version in AnswerX, either(for consistency). But if you want them I'm happy to add them(probably with your kind advice)! \r\n- In the examples in VoidAnswerX I have to also import org.mockito.stubbing.VoidAnswerX to build the test successfully, which appears a little bit strange:-(  \r\n\r\nThanks for your review!!  \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSaiyi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1003314015,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwMDMzMTQwMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1003314015","actor":{"login":"SaiyiW","id":22788926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzg4OTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22788926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW","html_url":"https://github.com/SaiyiW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c64d7cf9fbde85726ed04346d8036121f51bbb38","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/delftswa2017/mockito/commits/c64d7cf9fbde85726ed04346d8036121f51bbb38","created_at":"2017-03-16T18:55:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1003603549,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwMDM2MDM1NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1003603549","actor":{"login":"SaiyiW","id":22788926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzg4OTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22788926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW","html_url":"https://github.com/SaiyiW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaiyiW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"42ea418a0d077cb27b5704163a13060f81c0db4d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/delftswa2017/mockito/commits/42ea418a0d077cb27b5704163a13060f81c0db4d","created_at":"2017-03-16T22:15:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1025165078,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTAyNTE2NTA3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/1025165078","actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"dcb21e0f17c783e99254e8486c115d6a0251a793","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/commits/dcb21e0f17c783e99254e8486c115d6a0251a793","created_at":"2017-04-01T11:02:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
