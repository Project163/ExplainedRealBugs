encountered unchecked or unsafe operations in `GroupMetadataManagerTest.java`, `KTableImplTest.java`, and `ConfigCommandIntegrationTest.java`.\n\n* Rewrite getArgument of invocation in InvocationOnMock API because the implementation of InvocationOnMock discards type anyway in in `GroupMetadataManagerTest.java`.\n\n* Remove unchecked annotations for using mock API without variable assignment in `KTableImplTest.java`.\n\n  <img width=\"1422\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-03-02 at 8 50 55 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10ff1799-ebaa-499c-9acd-ca3b30484e6d\" />\n
