the fallout of #2331 is indeed unfortunate. Apologies for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nLooking at the problems listed in this issue, the `HashSet` problem seems to me like it is working as intended. E.g. Mockito now correctly identifies a call on the mock (namely `.hashCode()`) and the code wasn't expecting that call to be there. I think it is fair to argue that the previous behavior was fine, but I think there is a reasonable argument to make that the new behavior is better.\r\n\r\nWith the second problem (that @vyazelenko also appears to run into), seems to be an issue with `Hamcrest` and `assertThat`. The issue is puzzling, as Mockito now correctly delegates any calls to `equals` to the mock. E.g. the real implementation of `equals` is called, which should be both safe (per the `Object` interface) and semantically more correct. I wonder if this might be an issue in Hamcrest itself (or at least the integration of both Hamcrest and Mockito).\r\n\r\nWhile I think the new behavior is the way to go, especially in the `.hashCode()` situation, I think it is fair to introduce some way to ignore such calls. I wonder if we can add a setting on a mock that would say \"you can call hashCode/equals and we don't mind\" or something.\r\n\r\nWould that be a workable solution for you?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/903945595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5195690714,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE5NTY5MDcxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/5195690714","actor":{"login":"vyazelenko","id":696855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Njg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko","html_url":"https://github.com/vyazelenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-23T16:54:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5195690723,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxOTU2OTA3MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/events/5195690723","actor":{"login":"vyazelenko","id":696855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Njg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko","html_url":"https://github.com/vyazelenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vyazelenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-23T16:54:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/903949565","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2399#issuecomment-903949565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2399","id":903949565,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAF62v8414Sz9","user":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T17:00:1
