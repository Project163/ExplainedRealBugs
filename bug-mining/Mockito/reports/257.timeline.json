`CapturingMatcher` can use the Class-Object passed to the `ArgumentCaptor` and capture only arguments that are instances of the expected type. This solution has a down side the captor still matches anything which may surprise users, here is an example:\n\n```\nstringArgs= ArgumentCaptor.forClass(String.class);\nmock.call(123);\nmock.call(\"abc\");\nverify(mock).call(stringArgs.capture()); //fails with too many invocations cause call(123) matches too.\n```\n\nIf the `CapturingMatcher` matches only instances of the expected type then existing client tests may break.

would be awesome to support a syntax like this:\n\n``` java\nMockito.when(mock::method).isInvokedWith(foo,bar).thenAnswer((foo, bar) -> 5);\n```\n\nThe benefits: true type safety. Currently we have an interim solution which helps a lot with Java 8, but it still [relies on casting](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/master/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/stubbing/answers/AnswerFunctionalInterfaces.java#L39).\nAlso the `when` syntax can be confusing compared to the `verify` syntax, since verify actually has the method call on the return value of `verify()` whereas `when` wants the method call inside its function argument.\n\nThis reads a lot more fluent imo and given the compiler warnings and similarity to `verify` could greatly benefit new users.\n\nThe biggest issue with this syntax is probably: how do we track the lambda reference? I have tried to come up with a proof of concept, but since `mock::method` just returns a `Function` without any points to what mock it was actually referring too, I could not extract the actual mock we should stub for. Maybe we can do some Bytecode magic there?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/643/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/289491427","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/565#issuecomment-289491427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/565","id":289491427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTQ5MTQyNw==","user":{"login":"paulduffin","id":4938819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzg4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4938819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulduffin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-27T15:35:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T15:35:01Z","body":"What is the status of this (or #358)?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/289491427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"paulduffin","id":4938819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzg4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4938819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulduffin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulduffin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/289492262","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/565#issuecomment-289492262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/565","id":289492262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTQ5MjI2Mg==","user":{"login":"TimvdLippe","id":5948271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDgyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5948271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe","html_url":"https://github.com/TimvdLippe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimvdLippe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-27T15:37:36Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T15:37:36Z","body":"Type-safety is still something I am investigating, targeting Mockito 3.

also tried to remove the VarargMatcher from the custom ArgumentMatcher but that failed too as the number of arguments did not match in

ticket tries to summarize which features are similar in our public API. The intention is to give an overview of which code we have to maintain, as well as trying to identify inconsistencies and confusion between various API's\r\n\r\n# Stubbing\r\nThere are 9 ways to stub a method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nwhen(mock.foo()).thenReturn('Bar');\r\ndoReturn('Bar').when(mock).foo();\r\n\r\nwhen(mock.foo()).thenThrow(MockException.class);\r\nwhen(mock.foo()).thenThrow(new MockException());\r\ndoThrow(MockException.class).when(mock).foo();\r\ndoThrow(new MockException()).when(mock).foo();\r\n\r\ndoNothing().when(mock).foo();\r\n\r\nwhen(mock.foo()).thenAnswer(new Answer() {...});\r\ndoAnswer(new Answer() {...}).when(mock).foo();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd there are 2 ways to call the real method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nwhen(mock.foo()).thenCallRealMethod();\r\ndoCallRealMethod().when(mock).foo();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe existence of 2+ ways to achieve the same thing, is because of the way stubs are handled.\r\nIn general, `when(mock.foo())` is the preferred way to stub.\r\nHowever, sometimes we already stubbed this method (#1237), we want to stub it but it is a spy (#500), the method is a consumer (returns `void`).\r\nFor all these cases, the different stubbing method has to be used (e.g. the `doXYZ().when(mock).foo()`).\r\nNew users get confused by this difference and can confuse the 2 API's quite easily.\r\n\r\nWe also completely mirror our full API in BDDMockito, because the name `when()` was changed to `given()`.\r\n\r\n## Stubbing vs Verification\r\n\r\nIn contrast, verification always uses the pattern `verify(mock).foo()`.\r\nThis method is yet again a different syntax than the one used for stubbing.\r\nReason being: we don't want to prematurely invoke the method, because it would run the stub.\r\nThis stub could throw an exception, screwing up the test.\r\n\r\nI still remember that when I was a first-time user of Mockito (~4 years ago), this difference in API thoroughly confused me.\r\n\r\n# VerificationModes\r\n\r\n## After and Timeout\r\n\r\nThere is a very subtle difference between the two API's, as described in #472.\r\nEven to me, the difference is so subtle I would not know which one to use in which situation.\r\nRather, I would like to see an API based on real-world use-cases, presumably related to Futures and Observables.\r\n\r\n## Multiple Modes\r\n\r\nThe API for VerificationModes is pretty brittle atm.\r\nThis is largely a result of [`VerificationWrapper`](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2.x/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/verification/VerificationWrapper.java) which is tightly coupled to all of our implementations of `VerificationMode`.\r\nMoreover, there is a different wrapper specifically for in-order matching, which is treated completely different.\r\n\r\nAs a user, it is hard to create custom `VerificationMode`, while still being able to use multiple modes at the same time.\r\nSee #339, #417 for examples of users wanting to add usage of a new mode.\r\n\r\n# ArgumentMatchers\r\n\r\nAs noted in the JavaDoc of `ArgumentMatchers`:\r\n\r\n> Matcher methods like anyObject(), eq() do not return matchers. Internally, they record a matcher on a stack and return a dummy value (usually null). This implementation is due to static type safety imposed by java compiler. The consequence is that you cannot use anyObject(), eq() methods outside of verified/stubbed method.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we do internal verification of Mockito static state to detect this misuse.\r\nFor new users, this distinction is very subtle and generates quite some confusion.\r\n\r\n## Auto-boxing\r\n\r\nAs noted in the JavaDoc of `ArgumentMatchers`:\r\n\r\n> NullPointerException auto-unboxing caveat. In rare cases when matching primitive parameter types you *must* use relevant intThat(), floatThat(), etc. method. This way you will avoid NullPointerException during auto-unboxing. Due to how java works we don't really have a clean way of detecting this scenario and protecting the user from this problem. Hopefully, the javadoc describes the problem and solution well. If you have an idea how to fix the problem, let us know via the mailing list or the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nOnce again, this is a very subtle case that throws a NPE in \"unexpected\" ways.\r\n\r\n## any{Map, Set, Collection, Iterable, ...}\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of methods that return classes with generics, to correctly compile with the method.\r\nHowever, the generics are completely discarded on run-time (since we have no information).\r\nThe implementations thus do something like `new InstanceOf(Collection.class, \"<any collection>\")`.\r\nUsing the API gives users the impression we support generics, even though we don't.\r\n\r\n## XYZThat()\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of `XYZThat()` methods that wrap custom matchers, but then return a default value.\r\nWrapper matchers like that seems unnecessary and would be nice if we could avoid that.\r\n\r\n## eq()\r\n\r\nThese methods exist, as we need to call methods with the correct type.\r\nThe reason they have to be default values, is because we don't know whether we stubbed them or not (see section #Stubbing).\r\n\r\n## Duplicate implementation\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, the following methods achieve the same (taken from `ArgumentMatchers` and `AdditionalMatchers`):\r\n\r\n* `isA(Class)` and `any(Class)`\r\n* `nullable(Class)` and `or(isNull(), any(Class))`\r\n* `startsWith(\"foo\")` and `matches(\"^foo\")`\r\n* `endsWith(\"foo\")` and `matches(\"foo$\")`\r\n* `find(\"foo\")` and `matches(\"foo\")` and `contains(\"foo\")`\r\n\r\nThere is also a large amount of implementations for `or()`, `and()` and `not()` as well as arithmetic matchers as `gt()`.\r\n\r\n## Feature expansion and misuse\r\n\r\nEven though we have a large amount of matchers, we still receive updates with additions for new APIs such as #1164.\r\nMoreover, we have very hard-to-debug issues like #689 where we have to detect misuse of the API.\r\nAnd we have issues like #1204 where types are failing verifications.\r\n\r\n# ArgumentCaptor\r\n\r\nSlightly related to `ArgumentMatcher`, we also support capturing arguments.\r\nWhile useful, interaction resulted in debates about its API (#474), lack of type-safety (#565), inability to deal with varargs (#585) and integration with matchers (#358).\r\n\r\n# (Additional-)Answers\r\n\r\nThere is duplication between `answer()` and `answerVoid()` as a result of how we handle consumers vs functions.\r\nThis is mainly an issue, because we can't do `when(mock.consumer())` as `void` is not allowed to be passed in.\r\nMoreover, we have several (seemingly arbitrary) answers that implement functionality like `returnsFirstArg()`.\r\nThis is a direct result of our brittle API with `invocation` which makes handling answers quite cumbersome.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nAll in all, I think 1. our public API surface is too large and 2. extensibility with custom matchers/answers/etc... is quite cumbersome.\r\nMy conclusion regarding API size, is largely related to lack of type-safety and annoyances with Java 5-6.\r\nWith lambdas in Java 8+, we should be able to tackle these problems in a lot nicer way.\r\nThis should open up a unified way to handle functions + consumers, remove the need for a lot of our custom matchers/answers and simply replace them with lambdas.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/1249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/519452772","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/565#issuecomment-519452772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/565","id":519452772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTQ1Mjc3Mg==","user":{"login":"adriangalera","id":2077258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzcyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2077258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera","html_url":"https://github.com/adriangalera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangalera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-08T09:57:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T09:57:21Z","body":"What's

https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2796\r\nFixes: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/567\r\nFixes: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/584\r\nFixes: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1222\r\nFixes: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1498\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach to https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2805. \r\n\r\n## Key difference:\r\n\r\nThis approach adds the new `type()` method to the main `ArgumentMatcher` interface and leaves the, IMHO broken, `VarargsMatcher` interface alone.  \r\n\r\n## Benefit:\r\n\r\nBecause this approach leaves `VarargsMatcher` untouched, it does not require additional existing matchers to implement `VarargsMatcher` to fix issues such as https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/567. Where as the first PR would require `Null` and `NotNull` to be marked `VarargsMatcher`.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates new variants of `isNotNull` and `isNull` to address https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/567. \r\nHaving `InstanceOf` override `type()` provides a workable solution to https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1593.\r\nHaving `equals` override `type` addresses https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1222.\r\n\r\nIf we want to go with this approach I'll implement `type()` for all the other existing matchers.\r\n\r\n## Downside\r\n\r\nThe obvious downside is that this changes the public `ArgumentMatcher` interface, though in a backwards compatible way.\r\n\r\nThe default implementation _could_ be dropped in the next major version bump.\r\n\r\n## Known limitation\r\n\r\nThe main limitation I'm aware of, is not a new limitation. It is that it is not possible to assert only a single parameter is passed to the vararg parameter, when using a `VarargMatcher`, e.g. `any()`. (ref: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1593). For example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Given method:\r\nint vararg(String... args);\r\n\r\n// I want to mock this invocation:\r\nmock.vararag(\"one param\");\r\n\r\n// ...but not these:\r\nmock.vararg();\r\nmock.vararg(\"more than\", \"one param\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no current way to do this.  This is because in the following intuitive mocking:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ngiven(mock.vararg(any(String.class))).willReturn(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\n... matches zero or more vararg parameters, as the `any()` method is using `VarargMatcher`. It seems to me that `VarargMatcher` is... a little broken!  This is maybe something that should be consider a candiate for fixing in the next major version bump.  \r\n\r\nWhile it is not possible to fix any `VarargMatcher` based matchers in a backwards compatible way, this the approach in this PR it is possible to mock/verify exactly one vararg param using `isA`, rather than `any`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void shouldMatchExactlyOnParam() {\r\n        mock.varargs(\"one param\");\r\n\r\n        verify(mock).varargs(isA(String.class));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void shouldNotMatchMoreParams() {\r\n        mock.varargs(\"two\", \"params\");\r\n\r\n        verify(mock, never()).varargs(isA(String.class));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void shouldMatchAnyNumberOfParams() {\r\n        mock.varargs(\"two\", \"params\");\r\n\r\n        verify(mock).varargs(isA(String[].class));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n... because `isA` does not implement `VarargsMatcher`, and so can work as expected once it implements `type()`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n - [x] PR should be motivated, i.e. what does it fix, why, and if relevant how\r\n - [x] If possible / relevant include an example in the description, that could help all readers\r\n       including project members to get a better picture of the change\r\n - [x] Avoid other runtime dependencies\r\n - [x] Meaningful commit history ; intention is important please rebase your commit history so that each\r\n       commit is meaningful and help the people that will explore a change in 2 years\r\n - [x] The pull request follows coding style\r\n - [x] Mention `Fixes #<issue number>` in the description _if relevant_\r\n - [x] At least one commit should mention `Fixes #<issue number>` _if relevant_\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2807/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2807/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
