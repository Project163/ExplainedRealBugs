discovered your project today when thinking about better ways to handle logging-based testing. Our current setup is roughly like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static Logger createLoggerMock() {\r\n        Logger mock = createMock( Logger.class );\r\n\r\n        // TODO: Clumsy workaround for https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2644\r\n        doAnswer( invocation -> {\r\n            String format = invocation.getArgument( 0 );\r\n            Object[] allArguments = invocation.getArguments();\r\n            Object[] arguments = Arrays.copyOfRange( allArguments, 1, allArguments.length );\r\n            logger.trace( format, arguments );\r\n            return null;\r\n        } ).when( mock )\r\n                .trace( anyString(), (Object[])any() );\r\n\r\n        doAnswer( answerVoid( (VoidAnswer3<String, Object, Object>)\r\n                logger::debug\r\n        ) ).when( mock )\r\n                .debug( anyString(), any(), any() );\r\n\r\n        doAnswer( invocation -> {\r\n            String format = invocation.getArgument( 0 );\r\n            Object[] allArguments = invocation.getArguments();\r\n            Object[] arguments = Arrays.copyOfRange( allArguments, 1, allArguments.length );\r\n            logger.info( format, arguments );\r\n            return null;\r\n        } ).when( mock )\r\n                .info( anyString(), (Object[])any() );\r\n\r\n        doAnswer( answerVoid( (VoidAnswer2<String, Object>)( message, arg ) -> {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException( \"Unexpected log warning: \" + message + \", with argument \" + arg );\r\n        } ) ).when( mock )\r\n                .warn( any(), ArgumentMatchers.<Object>any() );\r\n\r\n        doAnswer( answerVoid( (VoidAnswer3<String, Object, Object>)( message, arg1, arg2 ) -> {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException( \"Unexpected log warning: \" + message + \", with arguments: \" + arg1 + \", \" + arg2 );\r\n        } ) ).when( mock )\r\n                .warn( any(), ArgumentMatchers.<Object>any(), ArgumentMatchers.any() );\r\n\r\n        doAnswer( answerVoid( (VoidAnswer3<String, Object, Object>)( message, arg1, arg2 ) -> {\r\n            if ( arg2 instanceof Throwable ) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException( \"Unexpected log error: \" + message + \" with argument \" + arg1, (Throwable)arg2 );\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException( \"Unexpected log error: \" + message + \" with arguments [\" + arg1 + \", \" + arg2 + \"]\" );\r\n            }\r\n        } ) ).when( mock )\r\n                .error( any(), ArgumentMatchers.<Object>any(), any() );\r\n\r\n        return mock;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, we let `debug()` and `trace()` calls pass through to an underlying Logback implementation to ensure that this output can be seen when running tests. `warn()` and `error()` logging will cause assertion failures. (The same will go for `info()` calls because we set up our mocks to always fail on non-mocked methods).\r\n\r\n_However_... moving all of this to use `slf4j-mock` is a bit of work, since we currently construct our mock/test objects in a `@BeforeEach`-method with JUnit. I'd really prefer an \"imperative\" approach where I manually construct the object being tested. This is part of what the `@BeforeEach`-method looks like at the moment:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void init() throws Exception {\r\n        AuditLoggingManager auditLoggingManager = createMock( AuditLoggingManager.class );\r\n\r\n        Logger logger = createLoggerMock();\r\n\r\n        subject = new TimescaleDBEventPopulator(\r\n                new JobConfig().withTypeName( \"timescale-db-event-populator\" ),\r\n                logger,\r\n                auditLoggingManager,\r\n                serverManager,\r\n                settingsManager,\r\n                timescaleDBManager\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        // [...]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne of the main motivations for looking at `slf4j-mock` is to get rid of this ugly manual `logger` injection here in the `TimescaleDBEventPopulator` constructor call. It would be really nice to just let `slf4j-mock` provide the SLF4J implementation to the class, so that we could remove this constructor parameter altogether, but preferably without having to move our whole setup to use a `@Mock` / `@InjectMocks`-based approach.\r\n\r\nSorry if what I'm trying to convey here might be a bit fuzzy. I think what I'm aiming for is mostly to minimize the impact on our existing test setup etc, if possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/s4u/slf4j-mock/issues/140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/s4u/slf4j-mock/issues/140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/comments/1144226516","html_url":"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2644#issuecomment-1144226516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockito/mockito/issues/2644","id":1144226516,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAF62v85EM4LU","user":{"login":"big-andy-coates","id":8012398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTIzOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8012398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates","html_url":"https://github.com/big-andy-coates","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-01T23:02:17Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T23:02:17Z","body":"I've had a bit of a dig and it looks like a bug to me.  `returnsArgAt` has similar issues.

#2644\r\n\r\nFixes issues around vararg handling for the following methods in `AdditionalAnswers`:\r\n * `returnsFirstArg`\r\n * `returnsSecondArg`\r\n * `returnsLastArg`\r\n * `returnsArgAt`\r\n * `answer`\r\n * `answerVoid`\r\n\r\nThese methods were not correctly handling varargs. For example,\r\n\r\n```java\r\ndoAnswer(answerVoid(\r\n      (VoidAnswer2<String, Object[]>) logger::info\r\n   )).when(mock)\r\n      .info(any(), (Object[]) any());\r\n\r\nmock.info(\"Some message with {} {} {}\", \"three\", \"parameters\", \"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould previously have resulted in a `ClassCastException` being thrown from the `mock.info` call.  This was because the `answerVoid` method was not taking into account that the second parameter was a varargs parameter and was attempting to pass the second actual argument `\"three\"`, rather than the second _raw_ argument `[\"three\", \"parameters\", \"\"]`.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add checks for varargs methods and, when encountered, check to see if the required parameter type is the raw varargs type or the its component type.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n - [x] Read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n - [x] PR should be motivated, i.e.

issue is related to a resolved issue  https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2644, which was resolved in 4.7.0 by https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2664.\r\n\r\nAs per the comment by @perlun in the above PR: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2664#issuecomment-1319816402\r\n\r\n@big-andy-coates I found a similar semi-related issue I think... With 4.7.0, this now works correctly:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        doAnswer(answerVoid((VoidAnswer2<String, Object[]>)\r\n                logger::info\r\n        )).when(mock)\r\n                .info(any(), (Object[]) any());\r\n```\r\n\r\n_However_, if I try to use this form which is slightly more ergonomic:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        doAnswer( answerVoid( (VoidAnswer2<String, Object[]>)\r\n                logger::info\r\n        ) ).when( mock )\r\n                .info( any(), any( Object[].class ) );\r\n```\r\n\r\n...the mocking will fail to intercept these method calls. :thinking: No error when creating the mock, but it just won't detect the method calls as expected.\r\n\r\nI _presume_ this has again something to do with the varargs parsing. `javac` resolves those two calls to the correct/same `logger.info()` overload, so so far so good.\r\n\r\nDo you want me to create a separate issue/repro repo for this? I'm not even sure if it's something that can be (easily) fixed, I just happened to see it now while trying to \"clean up our code\"... :sweat_smile:\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @perlun in
