-          The Apache Commons Pool open source software library provides
-          an object-pooling API and a number of object pool implementations.
-          Version 2 of Apache Commons Pool contains a completely re-written
-          pooling implementation compared to the 1.x series.  In addition to
-          performance and scalability improvements, version 2 includes robust
-          instance tracking and pool monitoring.

-             <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/PooledObjectFactory.html"><code>PooledObjectFactory</code></a>
-             provides a generic interface for managing the lifecycle of a pooled object:
-          </p>
-<source>
-public interface PooledObjectFactory&lt;T&gt; {
-    activateObject(PooledObject&lt;T&gt;)
-    destroyObject(PooledObject&lt;T&gt;)

-    makeObject()

-}

-          <p>
-            Users of 1.x versions of Commons Pool will notice that while the <code>PoolableObjectFactory</code>s used by
-            1.x pools create and manage pooled objects directly, version 2 <code>PooledObjectFactory</code>s create and
-            manage
-            <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/PooledObject"><code>PooledObject</code></a>s. These object wrappers
-            maintain object pooling state, enabling <code>PooledObjectFactory</code> methods to have access to data such
-            as instance creation time or time of last use.  A 
-            <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/impl/DefaultPooledObject"><code>DefaultPooledObject</code></a> is
-            provided, with natural implementations for pooling state methods. The simplest way to implement a
-            <code>PoolableObjectFactory</code> is to have it extend
-            <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/BasePooledObjectFactory.html"><code>BasePooledObjectFactory</code></a>.
-            This factory provides a <code>makeObject()</code> that returns <code>wrap(create())</code>
-            where <code>create</code> and <code>wrap</code> are abstract.  You provide an implementation of <code>create</code>
-            to create the underlying objects that you want to manage in the pool and <code>wrap</code> to wrap created
-            instances in <code>PooledObject</code>s.  To use <code>DefaultPooledObject</code> wrappers, use
-<source>
-@Override
- public PooledObject&lt;Foo&gt; wrap(Foo foo) {
-    return new DefaultPooledObject&lt;Foo&gt;(foo);
- }
- </source>
-          where <code>Foo</code> is the type of the objects being pooled (the return type of <code>create()</code>).
-          </p>
-          <p>
-             <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/KeyedPooledObjectFactory.html"><code>KeyedPooledObjectFactory</code></a>

+          performance and scalability improvements, version 2 includes robust

+             <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/PooledObjectFactory.html"><code>PooledObjectFactory</code></a>
+             provides a generic interface for managing the lifecycle of a pooled object:
+          </p>
+<source>
+public interface PooledObjectFactory&lt;T&gt; {
+    activateObject(PooledObject&lt;T&gt;)
+    destroyObject(PooledObject&lt;T&gt;)
+    destroyObject(PooledObject&lt;T&gt;, DestroyMode)
+    makeObject()

+    validateObject(PooledObject&lt;T&gt;)
+}
+</source>
+          <p>
+            Users of 1.x versions of Commons Pool will notice that while the <code>PoolableObjectFactory</code>s used by
+            1.x pools create and manage pooled objects directly, version 2 <code>PooledObjectFactory</code>s create and
+            manage
+            <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/PooledObject"><code>PooledObject</code></a>s. These object wrappers
+            maintain object pooling state, enabling <code>PooledObjectFactory</code> methods to have access to data such
+            as instance creation time or time of last use.  A 
+            <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/impl/DefaultPooledObject"><code>DefaultPooledObject</code></a> is
+            provided, with natural implementations for pooling state methods. The simplest way to implement a
+            <code>PoolableObjectFactory</code> is to have it extend
+            <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/commons/pool2/BasePooledObjectFactory.html"><code>BasePooledObjectFactory</code></a>.
+            This factory provides a <code>makeObject()</code> that returns <code>wrap(create())</code>
+            where <code>create</code> and <code>wrap</code> are abstract.  You provide an implementation of <code>create</code>
+            to create the underlying objects that you want to manage in the pool and <code>wrap</code> to wrap created
+            instances in <code>PooledObject</code>s.  To use <code>DefaultPooledObject</code> wrappers, use
+<source>
+@Override
+ public PooledObject&lt;Foo&gt; wrap(Foo foo) {
+    return new DefaultPooledObject&lt;Foo&gt;(foo);
+ }
+ </source>
+          where <code>Foo</code> is the type of the objects being pooled (the return type of <code>create()</code>).

+             defines a similar interface for <code>KeyedObjectPool</code>s:
+          </p>
+<source>
+public interface KeyedPooledObjectFactory&lt;K,V&gt; {
+    PooledObject&lt;V&gt; makeObject(K key);
