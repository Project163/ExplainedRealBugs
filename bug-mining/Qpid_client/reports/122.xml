                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The client handles receiving released and modified outcomes for sent messages, but does not adverise them on the source for its producer links, only accepted and rejected. It should advertise all of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="15742946" author="gemmellr" created="Mon, 12 Dec 2016 19:48:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The meaning is just what the spec says of them. In terms of effect the JMS client would currently treat them non-accepted cases as a send failure (but it could in future do something else like try resending in certain cases...no plans on that though).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15743085" author="rgodfrey" created="Mon, 12 Dec 2016 20:39:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s just that the implication of supporting the outcomes would be that you actually do something with them, and I was curious as to what a (JMS) client could actually do with released or modified.  What you&apos;re actually saying is that the client only really supports two distinct outcomes (success and failure) but is liberal in how its partner communicates failure.  I can sort of see how released might be used with some sort of replay/managed failover scenario, but I struggle to think of any useful semantics for sending modified to a client.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15744816" author="gemmellr" created="Tue, 13 Dec 2016 10:33:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Essentially, yes, for now at least. I mainly did this as I thought thats what it was doing already and noticed it wasnt, though I believe I&apos;ve seen mention of Dispatch using both when doing message based routing for example depending on the precise nature of a given &apos;not able to be accepted&apos; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15744979" author="rgodfrey" created="Tue, 13 Dec 2016 12:01:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Which potentially points up a bug in Dispatch if it really replies with such an Outcome and the client which sent the message has not advertised support... which does bring up the question as what a receiver is supposed to do if the sender only claims support for &quot;Accepted&quot; and the receiver is not able to accept the message - tear down the link?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15744994" author="gemmellr" created="Tue, 13 Dec 2016 12:08:16 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Potentially, but I dont know if it sends them regardless, as I say I only made the change due to noticing it wasnt doing what I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually wondered the same question after I replied earlier. I don&apos;t think the spec talks to that situation that I can remember. In general the whole outcomes thing is a bit horrible &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
