Using DynamicMap() and ignore null source value approach to make the mapper ignore properties with NULL values on the source, but this doesn't appear to work in version 2.1.267.0 (current).\n\nHere's my mapping config:\n\n``` c#\nMapper.CreateMap<PersonDTO, Person>().ForAllMembers(\n    opt => opt.Condition(srs => !srs.IsSourceValueNull));\n```\n\nHere's my test:\n\n``` c#\n// Arrange   \nvar Person = new Person { FirstName = \"Bruce\", Surname = \"Lee\"};\nvar PersonDto = new PersonDTO { FirstName = \"Jet\", Surname = null };\n\n// Act\nMapper.Map(PersonDto, Person);\n\n// Assert\nAssert.AreEqual(\"Jet\", Person.FirstName); // Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<Jet>. Actual:<Bruce>. \nAssert.AreEqual(\"Lee\", Person.Surname, \"Surname field with NULL value should not have been mapped\");\n```\n\nDoes it work for you? And if so, can you spot the problem in my code?\n\n<!---\n@huboard:{\"order\":1.84375}\n-->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/490631431","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/220#issuecomment-490631431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/220","id":490631431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDYzMTQzMQ==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T20:06:29Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T20:06:29Z","body":"This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
