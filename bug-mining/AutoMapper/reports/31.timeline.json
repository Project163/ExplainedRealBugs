However, this has the affect of evaluating subsequent statements in the mapping, however their results do not get assigned to the destination.  \n\nBecause of this, the current unit tests work correctly, but since there is no obvious affect from the evaluation of the mapping, and none of the unit tests contain any subsequent statements that are dependent upon the condition (such as a null reference, or an out of bounds reference), the subtleties of the problem are not shown.\n\nThis seems to be a deliberate behavior so that ForAllMembers works correctly, but also has the side-effect of executing subsequent statements as well, then throwing away their results.  Is there a compromise here so that ForAllMembers works and subsequent statements are not executed?\n\nOr is the official stance that subsequent statements should not be considered to short-circuit if the condition is false?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/9516761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Mystere","id":1641593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDE1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere","html_url":"https://github.com/Mystere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mystere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/9524791","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/259#issuecomment-9524791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/259","id":9524791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk1MjQ3OTE=","user":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-17T12:05:56Z","updated_at":"2012-10-17T12:05:56Z","body":"I
