Mine is with a custom converter for DateTime? to DateTime?, which I know sounds weird, but it is doing something conditionally based on the source and destination models to adjust for the timezone. Regardless, my converter is called TimeZoneConverter and there is a nullable one too, called NullableTimeZoneConverter, with the interface for ITypeConverter, just like your NullableDateTimeOffsetConverter I would imagine. \n\nNow, the non-nullable one works, but the nullable one throws \"This operation is only valid on generic types.\"\n\n```\nCreateMap<System.DateTime, System.DateTime>().ConvertUsing<TimeZoneConverter>(); //works\nCreateMap<System.DateTime?, System.DateTime?>().ConvertUsing<NullableTimeZoneConverter>(); //does not work...\n```\n\nI tried doing it this way instead:\n\n```\nCreateMap<System.DateTime?, System.DateTime?>().ConvertUsing(new NullableTimeZoneConverter());\n```\n\nHowever, that gave a different, and even stranger error : \"Expression of type 'System.Nullable`1[System.Int32]' cannot be used for parameter of type 'System.Nullable`1[System.DateTime]'\" \n\nSo then I tried it this way:\n\n```\nCreateMap<System.DateTime?, System.DateTime?>().ConvertUsing((src, ctx) => new NullableTimeZoneConverter().Convert(src, ctx));\n```\n\nAnd got the same \"Expression of type 'System.Nullable`1[System.Int32]' cannot be used for parameter of type 'System.Nullable`1[System.DateTime]'\" error\n\nThis one is really strange since there is no integer involved at all. It just nullable datetime to nullable datetime, yet, somehow it thinks it is converting from a nullable

So we have to upgrade to get this fix. Alas, there are too many changes! \n\nThe big issue for us appears to be that the signature of ITypeConverter has radically changed and ResolutionContext is now missing Parent. \n\nWe have a converter that converts from a DateTime to a DateTime, which does so to automatically adjust the datetime up or down for the user's TimeZone. That way, all DateTimes from the domain and converted to the user's TZ and all DateTimes originating from a non-domain ViewModel are coverted back to server time. \n\nOur 4.2.1 converter looked like this:\n\n```\npublic class TimeZoneConverter : ITypeConverter<DateTime, DateTime>\n    {\n        public DateTime Convert(ResolutionContext source)\n        {\n            var sourceValue = (DateTime)source.SourceValue;\n            string timezone = ApplicationCache.TimeZone;\n\n            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(timezone))\n                return sourceValue;\n\n            bool convertFrom = (source.Parent.DestinationType.Namespace.Contains(\"Domain\") || ((source.Parent.Parent != null) && source.Parent.Parent.DestinationType.Namespace.Contains(\"Domain\")));\n            if (convertFrom)\n            {\n                //Convert the date from the user's time zone to the server/db time to copy back to domain\n                return sourceValue.ConvertFromSpecifiedTimeZone(timezone);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                //Convert the date to the specified timezone when returning from the domain\n                return sourceValue.ConvertToSpecifiedTimeZone(timezone);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nI have manged to make the changes for 5.0 except for the missing Parent property. Here's what I have so far:\n\n```\n    public class TimeZoneConverter : ITypeConverter<DateTime, DateTime>\n    {\n        public DateTime Convert(DateTime source, ResolutionContext context)\n        {\n            string timezone = ApplicationCache.TimeZone;\n\n            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(timezone))\n                return source;\n\n            bool convertFrom = context.Parent.DestinationType.Namespace.Contains(\"Domain\") || ((context.Parent.Parent != null) && context.Parent.Parent.DestinationType.Namespace.Contains(\"Domain\")));\n            if (convertFrom)\n            {\n                //Convert the date from the user's time zone to the server/db time to copy back to domain\n                return source.ConvertFromSpecifiedTimeZone(timezone);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                //Convert the date to the specified timezone when returning from the domain\n                return source.ConvertToSpecifiedTimeZone(timezone);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nBut context.Parent no longer exits. I have to be able to interrogate this to determine if the destination is in our Domain layer or not. But basically, I just need either the full namespace of the source or destination model to which the property belongs.\n\nWe also have a Nullable version of this, NullableTimeZoneConverter, which has the same issue, as well as the issue describe in issue #1389.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":707642320,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzA3NjQyMzIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/707642320","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"87a6a06cb429cf97b80e290db6678d287db44e18","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/commits/87a6a06cb429cf97b80e290db6678d287db44e18","created_at":"2016-06-29T11:55:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":707642323,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDcwNzY0MjMyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/707642323","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"99ce4d6dc133ac04e10548bb7b9a248e8e711233","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/commits/99ce4d6dc133ac04e10548bb7b9a248e8e711233","created_at":"2016-06-29T11:55:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/490097999","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1389#issuecomment-490097999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1389","id":490097999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDA5Nzk5OQ==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T14:14:44Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T14:14:44Z","body":"This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
