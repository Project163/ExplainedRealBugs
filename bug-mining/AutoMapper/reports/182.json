For the analogous ICollections in the view models I use Lists instead.

In previous versions the HashSet would be replaced a List and the database operation would proceed without issue, but since 6.2 you get an AutoMapperMappingException.","closed_by":{"login":"lbargaoanu","id":4517428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTc0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4517428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu","html_url":"https://github.com/lbargaoanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/2397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/2397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
