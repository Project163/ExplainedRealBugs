This cause k__BackingField  in the Json.\n\nMy code is like this:\n\n``` csharp\nclass User\n{\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n}\n\nUser user = new User { UserName = \"hello\" };\ndynamic d = Mapper.Map<ExpandoObject>(user);\nstring json = Json((ExpandoObject)d);\n```\n\nThe result json like this\n\n``` json\n{\"UserName\":\"hello\",\"<UserName>k__BackingField\":\"hello\"}\n```\n\nIf I just serialize the user object, it is OK.\n\n``` csharp\nUser user = new User { UserName = \"hello\" };\nstring json = Json(user);\n```\n\nresult\n\n``` json\n{\"UserName\":\"hello\"}\n```\n\nI try to use mapperconfiguration, but it doesn't help,even when I set false to those filter.\n\n``` csharp\nUser user = new User { UserName = \"hello\" };\nMapper.Initialize(cfg =>\n{\n    cfg.ShouldMapProperty = p => false;\n    cfg.ShouldMapField = f => false;\n});\ndynamic d = Mapper.Map<ExpandoObject>(user);\nstring json = Json((ExpandoObject)d);\n```\n\nThe result is still\n\n``` json\n{\"UserName\":\"hello\",\"<UserName>k__BackingField\":\"hello\"}\n```\n\nIf I change the automatic property  to field, everything is well, but I think it's not  a good solution.\nI don't know why the filter is not working. How should I do to remove  the k__BackingField members?\nThanks.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Ruikuan","id":7594271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTQyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7594271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan","html_url":"https://github.com/Ruikuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ruikuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
