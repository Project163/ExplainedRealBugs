I would imagine this working by using Mappings similar to this:\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<Animal, AnimalDto>()\n.PreMap(animalProxy => Helper.CastToEntity(animalProxy))\n.Include<Cat, CatDto>\n.Include<Dog, DogDto>\n```\n\nThe PreMap would give me an injection point to substitute what I am mapping for something else (only substituting an Animal for another Animal in the example) But what in reality, I could be substituting a dynamic AnimalProxy for a 'real' Cat or Dog entity before continuing on with the mappings.\n\nOf course I could solve this by calling CastToEntity on everything before passing it to Mapper.Map, but that gets complicated when mapping a Kennel that contains a list of Animals...\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
