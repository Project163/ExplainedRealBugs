For example, say I have the following source and destination objects:\n\n``` csharp\npublic class Restaurant\n{\n    ...\n    public DbGeography Location { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class RestaurantDto\n{\n    ...\n    public double? Distance { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nThen I've got a method that does a query based on a certain location, and needs to returns shops ordered by their location, along with their distance from that location. Something like this:\n\n``` csharp\npublic PageDto<RestaurantDto> GetByLocation(double lat, double long, int page, int pageSize)\n{\n    Page<Restaurant> restaurants = _repository.GetByLocation(lat, long, page, pageSize);\n\n    return Mapper.Map<PageDto<RestaurantDto>, Page<Restaurant>>(restaurants);\n}\n```\n\nOne solution is to wrap the Page<Restaurant> in another class that contains the current location, then make the mapping something like Mapper.CreateMap&lt;Wrapper&lt;Page&lt;Restaurant>>, PageDto&lt;RestaurantDto>>(). This ends up being quite messy though. What I'd like to be able to do instead is something like this:\n\n``` csharp\npublic PageDto<RestaurantDto> GetByLocation(double lat, double long, int page, int pageSize)\n{\n    Page<Restaurant> restaurants = _repository.GetByLocation(lat, long, page, pageSize);\n\n    var currentLocation = DbGeography.FromText(string.Format(\"Point({0} {1})\", long, lat);\n    var context = new Dictionary<string, object>{ { \"CurrentLocation\", currentLocation } };\n\n    return Mapper.Map<PageDto<RestaurantDto>, Page<Restaurant>>(restaurants, context);\n}\n```\n\nThis context would then be passed down through all the layers in the mapper so I could do something like:\n\n``` csharp\nMapper.CreateMap<Restaurant, RestaurantDto>()\n    .ForMember(dto => dto.Distance, (o, c) => o.MapFrom(r => r.Location.Distance((DbGeography)c[\"CurrentLocation\"])));\n```\n\nDoes that seem sensible, or is there already an easier way to do this?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
