upgrading to 5.0.2 it seems one of my mappings in throwing the following exception - \n`Expression of type 'System.Nullable`1[System.DateTime]' cannot be used for return type 'System.DateTime'`\n\nThe destination property is a nullable date time and the mapping is as follows -\n`ForMember(Function(dest) dest.EndDate, Sub(opt) opt.MapFrom(Function(src) If(src.ExamType = ExamType.Makeup, src.ExamSchedules.Max(Function(m) m.Schedule.DtEnd), src.ExamSchedules.Where(Function(f) f.Schedule.BHide = False).Max(Function(m) m.Schedule.DtEnd)))).`\n\nIf I try to change the destination to just Date then the configuration doesn't throw an exception but I will get an exception later on when my code is run that uses the mapping because there are times where there are no values and it should be null.\n\nNot sure if there is something I'm missing or whether this is a bug or already discussed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":719376343,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDcxOTM3NjM0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/719376343","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a00ac731e15a50251b3e90ee710dc40e0a2cd6e6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/commits/a00ac731e15a50251b3e90ee710dc40e0a2cd6e6","created_at":"2016-07-11T22:02:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":719389874,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzE5Mzg5ODc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/719389874","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"a00ac731e15a50251b3e90ee710dc40e0a2cd6e6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/commits/a00ac731e15a50251b3e90ee710dc40e0a2cd6e6","created_at":"2016-07-11T22:16:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/490054408","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1483#issuecomment-490054408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1483","id":490054408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDA1NDQwOA==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T12:15:03Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T12:15:03Z","body":"This
