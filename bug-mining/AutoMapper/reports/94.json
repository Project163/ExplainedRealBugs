am building a Win8.1 Store app and have generated a custom profile class by inheriting from the **Automapper.Profile** class.\n\nCompiling the app generates three instances of this warning message:\n_.\\packages\\AutoMapper.3.3.0\\lib\\windows8\\AutoMapper.dll : warning CS1684: Reference to type 'System.Reflection.BindingFlags' claims it is defined in 'c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework.NETCore\\v4.5.1\\mscorlib.dll', but it could not be found._\n\nI am also employing **Code Contracts** in my app and this problem further results in a **ccrewrite error**  _Rewrite aborted due to metadata errors._\n\nIs it possible to fix this problem in the Win8.1 Automapper implementation or should I simply remove my dependency on Automapper.Profile.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/658/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
