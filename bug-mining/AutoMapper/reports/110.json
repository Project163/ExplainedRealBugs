This breaks code written using the 4.0.4 overload, and it does so in a way which will not introduce any compile errors - the code will silently fail, trying to use the default mapper instead, as the new overload takes precedence.\n\nThe following code works fine in 4.0.4:\n\n```\n[TestClass]\npublic class UnitTest1\n{\n    [TestMethod]\n    public void TestMethod1()\n    {\n        var mapperConfig = new ConfigurationStore(new TypeMapFactory(), MapperRegistry.Mappers);\n        mapperConfig.CreateMap<Foo, Bar>();\n        var mapper = new MappingEngine(mapperConfig);\n\n        IList<Foo> source = new List<Foo>();\n\n        var result = source.AsQueryable().ProjectTo<Bar>(mapper).ToList();\n    }\n\n    public class Foo { }\n\n    public class Bar { }\n}\n```\n\nIn 4.1.0 it will fail because it falls back to using the default mapper.  The code has to be changed to work, from:\n\n```\nvar result = source.AsQueryable().ProjectTo<Bar>(mapper).ToList();\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nvar result = source.AsQueryable().ProjectTo<Bar>(null, mapper).ToList();\n```\n\nI appreciate it's a bit late to do anything about this change as people will already have begun upgrading - fortunately my unit tests caught this behaviour and I was able to spot it.  I think the release notes could do with mentioning this change however.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
