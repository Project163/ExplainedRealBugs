I also added summary documentation.\n\nThis addresses https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/issues/187 (and it appears to be related to https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/issues/173 and https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/issues/218).\n\n(Note: I previously submitted a pull request with a different solution involving an overload to AssertConfigurationIsValid(), but I believe this is a better solution because it allows more fine-grained control and doesn't make any existing methods obsolete. I also managed not to screw up the line endings this time :))\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":116845062,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDExNjg0NTA2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/116845062","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-05-01T02:32:17Z","milestone":{"title":"3.3.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":116845063,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MTE2ODQ1MDYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/116845063","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-05-01T02:32:17Z","milestone":{"title":"v.Next"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":128649946,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEyODY0OTk0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/128649946","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-06-06T02:14:27Z","label":{"name":"Feature","color":"009800"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":163064722,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTYzMDY0NzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/163064722","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"
