Install NuGet package `AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection` version **8.1.0**\r\n2. Create two classes `TConcrete`, `TInterface` and an interface `TInterface` with `TConcrete` implements `TInterface`\r\n3. Create mapping in a profile class with `CreateMap<TModel, TInterface>().As<TConcrete>();`\r\n4. Use `IMapper.Map<TInterface>(model)` where `model` is an instance of `TModel`.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\nThe output of `IMapper.Map<TInterface>(model)` should be an instance of `TConcrete`.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nThe program throws `ArgumentException` with message :\r\n\r\n> Expression of type 'TInterface' cannot be used for parameter of type 'TConcrete' (Parameter 'arg1')\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\nThe program runs correctly when revert the NuGet package to version **8.0.1**","closed_by":{"login":"lbargaoanu","id":4517428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTc0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4517428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu","html_url":"https://github.com/lbargaoanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/3526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/3526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
