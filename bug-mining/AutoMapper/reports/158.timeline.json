If this is intentional, override 'VisitUnary' and change it to allow this rewrite..\n\n(As a side note, the issues I've run into during Seal have been somewhat difficult to diagnose, e.g. having to comment out mappings until I narrow in on the one that caused the problem. Is it possible to add more diagnostic information like source/dest type/member into the exceptions? I can create a separate issue for this if necessary.)\n\nHere is an example mapping:\n\n```\n[TestClass]\npublic class UnitTest1\n{\n    static UnitTest1()\n    {\n        Mapper.Initialize(cfg =>\n        {\n            cfg.CreateMap<Source, Target>()\n                .ForMember(t => t.X, opts => opts.MapFrom(s => s.X > 0 ? s.X : default(short?)));\n        });\n    }\n\n    [TestMethod]\n    public void IncludedMappings()\n    {\n        var src = new Source\n        {\n            X = 0\n        };\n\n        var dest = Mapper.Map<Source, Target>(src);\n\n        Assert.AreEqual(src.X, dest.X);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Source\n{\n    public short X { get; set; }\n}\n\nclass Target\n{\n    public short?
