set;}\nstring Name {get; set;}\nIEnumerable<Tag> ChildTags {get; set;}\n}\n\npublic void Test()\n{\nvar source = new List<Tag>\n{\nnew Tag { Id = 1, Name = \"Tag 1\", ChildTags = new List<Tag>\n{\nnew Tag { Id = 2, Name = \"Tag 2\", ChildTags = new List<Tag>\n{\nnew Tag {Id = 3, Name = \"Tag 3\"},\nnew Tag {Id = 4, Name = \"Tag 4\"}\n}\n}\n}\n},\nnew Tag { Id = 1, Name = \"Tag 1\" },\nnew Tag {\nId = 3, Name = \"Tag 3\", ChildTags = new List<Tag>\n{\nnew Tag {Id = 4, Name = \"Tag 4\"}\n}\n}\n};\n\nMapper.CreateMap<Tag, Tag>()\n.ForMember(dest => dest.ChildTags,\nopt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.ChildTags));\nvar result = Mapper.Map<IList<Tag>, IList<Tag>>(tags);\n}\n```\n\nIn the result\n- the first instance of Tag 1 (ie source[0]) and all of its children are perfect\n- the second instance of Tag 1 (ie source[1]) has all the children of the first instance - it should not have any children\n- the second instance of Tag 3 (ie source[2]) does not have any children - it should have Tag 4 as a child\n\nBetter formatted code for this issue can be found here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11333732/how-do-i-get-automapper-to-not-cache-mapped-objects/12637096#12637096\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
