Only the last call is actually &#42;after&#42; the mapping. The previous calls happens when AutoMapper finds the object in its cache and are before the mapping is complete, meaning some of the properties are not yet mapped. <br /><br />This feels like a bug to me. If you add a BeforeMap handler it&#39;s only invoked once as expected.<br /><br />I&#39;ve attached a modified version of the BidirectionalRelationships.cs unit test to show this behaviour<br /><br />Moving the AfterMap call from TypeMapMapper.Map to TypeMapObjectMapperRegistry.Map &#40;i.e same place that BeforeMap is called&#41; seems to solve the problem. All other tests still pass after doing that change.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
