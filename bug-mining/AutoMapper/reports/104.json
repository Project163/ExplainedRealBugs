I'm using AutoMapper 4.0.4.\n\nI'm trying to map and project (ProjectTo<>) some enum properties and the only working configuration I found was something like:\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<Source, Destination>();\nvar m = Mapper.CreateMap<SourceType, DestinationType>();\nm.ProjectUsing(s => (DestinationType)s);\nm.ConvertUsing(s => (DestinationType)s);\n\n//Source and Destination are classes\n//SourceType and DestinationType are enums and properties of Source and Destination\n```\n- Using `Mapper.Initialize(cfg => ...)` or `Mapper.AddProfile<Profile>()` have the same behavior\n\nIs there another way (simpler) to achieve that (mapping and projecting enums)?\nI'm asking this because I have several enums and if I just map them, there is no need of creating enum mapping, but projecting them doesn't work \"automatically\".\n\nPlease see a gist I created here: https://gist.github.com/brenovieira/106b904f3899713e090d\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/840/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
