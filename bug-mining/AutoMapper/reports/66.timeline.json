Considering the same scheme where Animal is abstract.\nSuppose automapper meets an AnimalProxy, he's looking, well is it linked to anything I know ? \nWho are you AnimalProxy ? Nhibernate answer, well I'm an Animal, but I dont know if im a Cat or a Dog, YET !\nSo Automapper saying yes but Animal is abstract, how am I supposed to create an instance of Animal ?\nWell I would say that you could dynamically create this class\n\npublic AnimalDynamicMapping : Animal\n{}\n\nThen just make an instance of it and Map your animal with it. Its not perfect because :\n\nSay we have:\n\npublic abstract Animal\n{\n   public bool IsAlive {get/set}\n}\nTurtle : Animal\n{\n    public Animal Friend {get/set}\n}\nFish : Animal\n{\n   public Fish Friend {get/set}\n}\n\nMaybe in your DB you have the Friend of one Fish who is the same than the Friend of the Turtle.\nIn that case you will create two references to describe the same object. Boooooooh\nBut maybe you just want to know if the friend of the turtle is Alive.\nIn that case it will work. Now if you want to count the number of Dead friends, you could end up counting twice the same one > Here you just have to be aware of it depending on your design.\n\nIts not perfect but it would be very great to have the option of doing it.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/33725995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lejige","id":6530023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MzAwMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6530023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige","html_url":"https://github.com/lejige","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lejige/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/33794723","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/409#issuecomment-33794723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/409","id":33794723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzk0NzIz","user":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-31T13:44:42Z","updated_at":"2014-01-31T13:44:42Z","body":"Marking for 3.2 release\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/33794723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
