I further extended this with an option of a delegate that accepts `ResolutionResult, Source`. I also added (in fact, just pushed to public) same overloads for `ConvertUsing`.\n\nSo, as a result, following methods are now available:\n\n``` c#\nvoid ResolveUsing(Func<TSource, object> resolver);\nvoid ResolveUsing(Func<ResolutionResult, object> resolver);\nvoid ResolveUsing(Func<ResolutionResult, TSource, object> resolver);\n```\n\n``` c#\nvoid ConvertUsing(Func<TSource, TDestination> mappingFunction);\nvoid ConvertUsing(Func<ResolutionContext, TDestination> mappingFunction);\nvoid ConvertUsing(Func<ResolutionContext, TSource, TDestination> mappingFunction);\n```\n\nPS All that started because I needed `ConvertUsing(Func<ResolutionContext, TSource, TDestination> mappingFunction)` in my
