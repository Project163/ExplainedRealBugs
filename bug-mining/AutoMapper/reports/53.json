Now Automapper call the getter of the destination. In my opinion it shouldnt cause if has to set it. For example a getter could contains a access to a service when a private property is still null, for lazy loading.\n\nHere a failing test for Version 2.2.1 which works fine in Version 2.0.0\n\n```\npublic class AutomapperTestClass\n        {\n\n\n            [Test]\n            public void should_ignore_the_getter_of_destination()\n            {\n                Mapper.CreateMap<Source, Destination>();\n\n                var result = Mapper.Map<Destination>(new Source() {Foo = \"Bar\"});\n            }\n\n            private class Source\n            {\n                public string Foo { get; set; }\n            }\n\n            private class Destination\n            {\n                private string _foo;\n\n                public string Foo\n                {\n                    get { throw new Exception(); }\n                    set { _foo = value; }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/356/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
