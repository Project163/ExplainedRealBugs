This specific type, and a few others like it, have an optional Id property, which should either be provided in a constructor argument, or be `null` (and stay `null`). All other properties are mandatory.\n\nSince we do all other transformations of this kind in AutoMapper, it would be a shame if we couldn't do that here either - if for no other reason, then because of consistency across the code base.
