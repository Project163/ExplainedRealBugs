I get that GetType() of a nullable type returns the underlying type, but that just adds to the confusion. I've also noticed that for properties it seems the type of the property is used, not GetType() on the value of the property, so depending on context I get different results for the same types:\r\n```\r\nprivate class Source\r\n        {\r\n            public Source(int? value)\r\n            {\r\n                Field = value;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public int? Field { get; set; }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private class Target\r\n        {\r\n            public long Field { get; set; }\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        [TestMethod]\r\n        public void AnotherTest()\r\n        {\r\n            var mapper = new MapperConfiguration(cfg =>\r\n            {\r\n                cfg.CreateMap<int?, long>()\r\n                    .ConvertUsing(s => 12);\r\n                cfg.CreateMap<Source, Target>();\r\n            }).CreateMapper();\r\n                       \r\n            Assert.AreEqual(5, mapper.Map<int?, long>(5));\r\n            Assert.AreEqual(12, mapper.Map<Source, Target>(new Source(5)).Field);\r\n        }\r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/268894384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lemvigh","id":4123075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjMwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4123075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh","html_url":"https://github.com/lemvigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemvigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/268950372","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1865#issuecomment-268950372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1865","id":268950372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODk1MDM3Mg==","user":{"login":"lbargaoanu","id":4517428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTc0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4517428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu","html_url":"https://github.com/lbargaoanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-23T07:22:39Z","updated_at":"2016-12-23T07:22:39Z","body":"Yes, and probably that will always be the case.
