This provides a typed protection from issues like [mass assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_assignment_vulnerability) and keeps it very clear within a code-base which properties are intended for display, input, or no action at all. The existing facilities in MVC for specifying which properties to bind are somewhat clumsy or ugly (e.g. specifying property names via strings, decorating properties with `[Bind]`, etc.).\r\n\r\nWe'd like to provide a very basic object mapper in the box to assist in dealing with accepting input models and copying their values to domain or data models, and vice-versa for producing output/view-models. It is **not** intended to be a fully featured object mapping system, but rather a a simple way to handle the most basic of requirements that people are exposed to when implementing these model binding patterns. To that end, it will only support recursive property assignment based on name matching. It will not include features such as flattening (`CustomerName -> Customer.Name`), construction, immutable object creation (via constructor params), configurable conventions, etc. Customers looking for features like this and more will be advised to use a fully-featured library such as [AutoMapper](http://automapper.org/). This included library thus likely act as an introduction to the concept of object mapping which customers will very often graduate from to libraries like AutoMapper.\r\n\r\nThe API will be static only with methods to perform a mapping operation, as well as create a mapping delegate that can be stored and invoked later. The implementation will use reflection to build and compile an `Expression` tree into a delegate. The static mapping function will cache these delegates by the type parameters so as to avoid excessive reflection and object traversal after first use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Mvc/issues/5883/reactions","total_count":67,"+1":1,"-1":57,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":9,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Mvc/issues/5883/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/490337039","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/557#issuecomment-490337039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/557","id":490337039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDMzNzAzOQ==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T03:51:57Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T03:51:57Z","body":"This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
