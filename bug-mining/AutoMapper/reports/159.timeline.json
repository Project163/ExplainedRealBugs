can I just double check I'm understanding what you mean?\n\nSo basically what you're saying is that in any situation like this where we have a closure, we should really create a separate custom resolver class to handle it.\n\nSo instead of:\n\n```\npublic class MyMapperConfig\n{\n    private readonly IDateTimeProvider _dateTimeProvider;\n\n    public MyMapperConfig(IDateTimeProvider dateTimeProvider)\n    {\n        _dateTimeProvider = dateTimeProvider;\n    }\n\n    public void Configure(IMapperConfigurationExpression config)\n    {\n        config.CreateMap<Booking, BookingDto>()\n            .ForMember(d => d.Total,\n                o => o.MapFrom(b => b.CalculateTotal(_dateProvider.CurrentRestaurantTime(b.Restaurant))));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhat we'd actually do is:\n\n```\npublic class MyMapperConfig\n{\n    public void Configure(IMapperConfigurationExpression config)\n    {\n        config.CreateMap<Booking, BookingDto>()\n            .ForMember(d => d.Total, o => o.ResolveUsing<BookingTotalCalculator>());\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BookingTotalCalculator : IValueResolver<Booking, BookingDto, int>\n{\n    private readonly IDateTimeProvider _dateTimeProvider;\n\n    public BookingTotalCalculator(IDateTimeProvider dateTimeProvider)\n    {\n        _dateTimeProvider = dateTimeProvider;\n    }\n\n    public int Resolve(Booking source, BookingDto dest, int destMember, ResolutionContext context)\n    {\n        return source.CalculateTotal(_dateProvider.CurrentRestaurantTime(source.Restaurant));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf so, I'll need to think about that for a while. I can sort of understand why it could be a problem, but I also feel like it's adding an extra layer of complication.\n\nOn another note, why is the destination member passed into a value resolver? I could sort of understand the source member being passed in, but I'm scratching my head as to why the destination gets passed
