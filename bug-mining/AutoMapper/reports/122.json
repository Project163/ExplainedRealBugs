set; }\n        public Book[] Books { get; set; }\n    }\n\n    public class Book\n    {\n        public string Name { get; set; }\n    }\n```\n\nThe result of this is that `mappedAuthor` has the `Name` property set correctly. The `Books` array has 2 elements but for each book in there, the `Name` property is null. The mapping will work if I change my config to this:\n\n``` C#\n            var config = new MapperConfiguration(cfg =>\n            {\n                cfg.CreateMissingTypeMaps = true;\n                cfg.CreateMap<ExpandoObject, Book>()\n                    .ForMember(\n                        dest => dest.Name,\n                        opts => opts.MapFrom(src => ((IDictionary<string, object>) src)[\"Name\"])\n                    );\n            });\n```\n\nThis feature is new so I'm not sure if this is a bug or if my configuration is wrong.\n","closed_by":{"login":"barriestewart","id":5237045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzcwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5237045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart","html_url":"https://github.com/barriestewart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barriestewart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
