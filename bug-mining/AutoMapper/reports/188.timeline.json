I think I didn't elaborate on my question.\r\n\r\nI am doing a normal .ProjectTo() map from EF entities to a Dto. In my Dto I have multiple IEnumerable properties that map from my EF navigation properties. When I materialise the IQueryable<,> returned from the .ProjectTo() method e.g. with a .First() everything is materialise except for my IEnumerable properties, they are materialise when I use them(Lazy Loading). If I try this same example in an older version of Automapper everything is materialise after I call .First including my IEnumerable properties.
