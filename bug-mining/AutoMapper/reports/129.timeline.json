@jbogard \n1. \"owner\" come from the getter of the `BranchCollection` Property.\n2. AutoMapper doesnt have to instantiate the `BranchCollection` Property Because it's NOT NULL, Whener AutoMapper wants to check that if  `BranchCollection` is NULL or not, The getter of the property will instantiate it (if is null).\n3. In version 4.2.1 this code works properly but in 5 beta not\n4. I think in the 4.2.1 version AutoMapper first check if it is null then tries to instantiate it (of course  `BranchCollection` cant be null ever), But in version 5 beta it tries to instantiate `BranchCollection` without checking if it is
