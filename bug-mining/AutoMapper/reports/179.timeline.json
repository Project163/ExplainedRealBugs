is probably a very rare case but hit's us with the .net core Identity classes because they reflect just this setup.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to define mapping rules for open generics and re-use them on the concrete implementation using IncludeBase, no errors appear while setting the mapping up, but the defined rules are not applied.\r\n\r\nGiven the following example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing AutoMapper;\r\n\r\nnamespace ConsoleApp3\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            Mapper.Initialize(cfg =>\r\n            {\r\n                cfg.CreateMap(typeof(BaseUserDto<>), typeof(BaseUserEntity<>))\r\n                    .ForMember(\"Id\", opt => opt.Ignore());\r\n\r\n                cfg.CreateMap(typeof(ConcreteUserDto), typeof(ConcreteUserEntity))\r\n                    .IncludeBase(typeof(BaseUserDto<>), typeof(BaseUserEntity<>));\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            var user = new ConcreteUserDto\r\n            {\r\n                Id = \"my-id\",\r\n                Name = \"my-User\"\r\n            };\r\n\r\n            var userEntity = Mapper.Map<ConcreteUserEntity>(user);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public abstract class BaseUserDto<TIdType>\r\n    {\r\n        public TIdType Id { get; set; }\r\n        public string Name { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class ConcreteUserDto : BaseUserDto<string>\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public abstract class BaseUserEntity<TIdType>\r\n    {\r\n        public TIdType Id { get; set; }\r\n        public string Name { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class ConcreteUserEntity : BaseUserEntity<string>\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expectation would be, that the resulting `userEntity` object has it's `Id` property set to null, however it is copied over from the DTO.\r\n\r\nWhen changing the example to hardcode all generics to `int`, everything works as expected.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/2513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/2513/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/489631970","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/2333#issuecomment-489631970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/2333","id":489631970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTYzMTk3MA==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T14:02:56Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T14:02:56Z","body":"This
