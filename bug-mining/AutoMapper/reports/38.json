I am using Automapper to map it to _Source, however I want the Children property to also be mapped. When Children is created by EntityFramework, it is a dynamic proxy but I need it to be mapped to _Child. I used the following, and it did not work:\n\nMapper.CreateMap<Source, _Source>()\n.ForMember(q => q.Children, \nx => x.MapFrom(opt=>Mapper.Map<ICollection<Child>, ICollection<_Child>>(opt.Children)));\nIt doesn't seem to be converting from the proxies, which inherit from Child to _Child, which is what I want it to do. I already have an existing map from Child to _Child, but it is not getting invoked.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
