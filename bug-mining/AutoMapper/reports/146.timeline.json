Is it possible to add more diagnostic information like source/dest type/member into the exceptions? I can create a separate issue for this if necessary.)\n\nHere is an example mapping:\n\n```\n[TestClass]\npublic class UnitTest1\n{\n    static UnitTest1()\n    {\n        Mapper.Initialize(cfg =>\n        {\n            cfg.CreateMap<Source, Target>()\n                .ForMember(t => t.X, opts => opts.MapFrom(s => s.X > 0 ? s.X : default(short?)));\n        });\n    }\n\n    [TestMethod]\n    public void IncludedMappings()\n    {\n        var src = new Source\n        {\n            X = 0\n        };\n\n        var dest = Mapper.Map<Source, Target>(src);\n\n        Assert.AreEqual(src.X, dest.X);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Source\n{\n    public short X { get; set; }\n}\n\nclass Target\n{\n    public short? X { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nAnother interesting aside is that the exception is significantly different if mapping int instead of short:\n\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: The binary operator GreaterThan is not defined for the types 'System.Nullable`1[System.Int32]' and 'System.Int32'..\n    at System.Linq.Expressions.Expression.GetUserDefinedBinaryOperatorOrThrow(ExpressionType binaryType, String name, Expression left, Expression right, Boolean liftToNull)\n   at System.Linq.Expressions.Expression.GreaterThan(Expression left, Expression right, Boolean liftToNull, MethodInfo method)\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/490055003","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1469#issuecomment-490055003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1469","id":490055003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDA1NTAwMw==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T12:17:03Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T12:17:03Z","body":"This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
