from #1461 \n\nI'm thinking check Binary Operations and if one side has a constant and other has map change, then change the constant in the same way the property map changed.\n\nSame for function calls that have the base change and update the constants that had a matching type.\nEx:  Equals() call vs using == operator.\n\nMaybe more scenarios need to be accounted for but it's a start.\n\nThe ExpressionMapper ExpressionVisitor logic is going to get a lot more complex
