Where in the previous version they didn't. And shouldn't.\r\n\r\nInvestigating:\r\nIn this case automapper reports a `mapping exception` because of an arbitrary value it gets from running an instance **method**. That is: A method named `GetXYZ` which it isn't supposed to execute during mapping. It's not supposed to be executed by the mapper because it's not tied to a property being mapped. It's just a regular instance method.\r\n\r\nSeeing this I got curious. I posited that it might have something to do with the **method's name starting with `Get`**. Which might cause Automapper to mistakenly assume that the method is a property. \r\n\r\nTurns out that was the case.\r\n\r\nWork-around:\r\nAfter I changed the method name to `GenerateXYZ` the exception was remedied. \r\n\r\nCommunity notes:\r\nIf you updated and are encountering new mapping exceptions: verify whether Automapper is calling any methods whose names start with `Get` and consider renaming those methods until a patch is issued. \r\nThis is obviously not feasible in many environments, in which case it would be better to postpone updating until a patch is issued.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lbargaoanu","id":4517428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTc0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4517428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu","html_url":"https://github.com/lbargaoanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/3523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/3523/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
