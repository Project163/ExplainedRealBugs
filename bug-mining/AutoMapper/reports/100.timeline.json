I've temporarily solved it by calling Extensions.ClearExpressionCache() between calls.  I see two solutions:\n\n1.)  Add IMappingEngine into the key of Extensions._expressionCache, possibly as part of the ExpressionRequest.  That way the cache can distinguish between expressions generated from different MappingEngines.\n\n2.)  Move _expressionCache into MappingEngine so each engine keeps track of its own cache, similarly to how it already does this with _objectMapperCache.  Then we might move some of the extension methods into the IMappingEngine interface.\n\nThoughts?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/66336918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alastrange","id":6774078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzQwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6774078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange","html_url":"https://github.com/alastrange","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alastrange/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/66337342","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/636#issuecomment-66337342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/636","id":66337342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzM3MzQy","user":{"login":"mwpowellhtx","id":1824187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjQxODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1824187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx","html_url":"https://github.com/mwpowellhtx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpowellhtx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-09T19:02:07Z","updated_at":"2014-12-09T19:02:19Z","body":"Personally, I'd like to see option 2.
