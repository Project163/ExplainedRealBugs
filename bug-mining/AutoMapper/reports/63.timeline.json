took a look at the test you added. Have you checked that the BasePrice property doesn't get accessed on the source object if the condition is false? (ie: short circuiting)\n\nNot sure if that's the issue but either way the test should capture that scenario. Can be achieved by changing the property accessor on the Source class to:\n\n``` C#\nset {\n    if( !HasBasePrice )\n        throw new InvalidOperationException( \"Has no base price\" );\n\n    return _basePrice;\n}\n```\n\nThis is the common design taken in our domain model for any properties whose values don't make sense in a particular state - and yes the instance values are correct. The code worked as expected (get accessor was not accessed if the mapping condition was false) in the 2.1.267 version prior to the library upgrade.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/13858796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marchy","id":1369360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjkzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1369360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy","html_url":"https://github.com/marchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/13902780","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/263#issuecomment-13902780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/263","id":13902780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTAyNzgw","user":{"login":"pver","id":1618378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTgzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1618378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver","html_url":"https://github.com/pver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pver/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-21T17:51:43Z","updated_at":"2013-02-21T17:51:43Z","body":"Hi @marchy, I've changed the test as described (the get of the BasePrice property now throws an exception if it's accessed while HasBasePrice equals false), but also in this case the test runs fine (see updated test at 3ebf01bef693bf4536ef870215e2d70e10363601)\n\nAre you also mapping the HasBasePrice property of the destination type? Maybe the order used to set the values in the destination object is important in you domain model?\n\nHave you tried with the latest 2.2.1 release @jbogard made a few days ago?
