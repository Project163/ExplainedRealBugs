mapped to the same object:\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<BaseItem,RandomDTO>();\nMapperCreateMap<ItemA,RandomDTO>();\n```\n\nWe got a generic method where we use a map like this `...Map<BaseItem,RandomDTO>` and this method can receive either the base or any of its implementations.\n\nIt turns out that when receiving a child object as input,  instead of getting the base map as we specified in code, it's going for the child map.

If so how can I explicitly tell AutoMapper _not_ to automatically map to a derived type?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/924/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"lbargaoanu","id":4517428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTc0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4517428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu","html_url":"https://github.com/lbargaoanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbargaoanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-09T11:35:51Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T11:35:51Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/890","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/890/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/890/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/890/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/890","id":106441530,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMDY0NDE1MzA=","number":890,"title":"Determining subclass to instanciate based from a property value using ConstructUsing/ConvertUsing not working after upgrading to v4","user":{"login":"Dunge","id":6548184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDgxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6548184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge","html_url":"https://github.com/Dunge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dunge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-09-14T22:31:52Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T00:05:25Z","closed_at":"2015-10-23T03:34:37Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":"resolved","sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":505380,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDUzODA=","name":"AutoMapper","full_name":"LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuckyPennySoftware","id":206369998,"node_id":"O_kgDODEz0zg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206369998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyPennySoftware/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper","description":"A convention-based object-object mapper in .NET.

If you have a proper solution of achieving the same result, you are welcome.\n\nI have a single class type loaded from the database, and a application model abstract class of the same name, along with multiple derived classes. Depending on the value of a property on the database model, instantiate one type or another. I also want to be able to map back and forth with their own mapping rules.\n\nHere's the code I was using (simplified to only two derived classes):\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<CommunicationSetting, Model.CommunicationSettings.CommunicationSetting>()\n            .Include<CommunicationSetting, DialupCommunicationSetting>()\n            .Include<CommunicationSetting, InputCommunicationSetting>()\n            .ConstructUsing(CommunicationSettingsConstructor)\n            .ConvertUsing(CommunicationSettingsMapper);\n\nMapper.CreateMap<Model.CommunicationSettings.CommunicationSetting, CommunicationSetting>()\n            .Include<DialupCommunicationSetting, CommunicationSetting>()\n            .Include<InputCommunicationSetting, CommunicationSetting>()\n            .IgnoreAllNonExisting();\n\nMapper.CreateMap<CommunicationSetting, DialupCommunicationSetting>()\n            .IgnoreAllNonExisting()\n            .ReverseMap()\n            .IgnoreAllNonExistingSource();\n\nMapper.CreateMap<CommunicationSetting, InputCommunicationSetting>()\n            .ForMember(dest => dest.InputType, opt => opt.MapFrom(t => (CommunicationInputType)t.SocketType))\n            .IgnoreAllNonExisting()\n            .ReverseMap()\n            .ForMember(dest => dest.SocketType, opt => opt.MapFrom(t => (int)t.InputType))\n            .IgnoreAllNonExistingSource();\n\n    private static readonly Func<CommunicationSetting, Model.CommunicationSettings.CommunicationSetting> CommunicationSettingsConstructor =\n        x =>\n        {\n            switch (x.Type)\n            {\n                case CommunicationType.Dialup:\n                    return new DialupCommunicationSetting();\n                case CommunicationType.Input:\n                    return new InputCommunicationSetting();\n            }\n            return null;\n        };\n\n    readonly static Func<CommunicationSetting, Model.CommunicationSettings.CommunicationSetting> CommunicationSettingsMapper =\n        x =>\n        {\n            switch (x.Type)\n            {\n                case CommunicationType.Dialup:\n                    return Mapper.Map<DialupCommunicationSetting>(x);\n                case CommunicationType.Input:\n                    return Mapper.Map<InputCommunicationSetting>(x);\n            }\n            return null;\n        };\n```\n\nSo with AutoMapper3, it would check the \"Type\" property and instantiate the proper mapped type and use the proper mapping rules. With AutoMapper4, it always instantiate in the last type defined in the createmap rules.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":441079668,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ0MTA3OTY2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/441079668","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4e9ef5af7919822c49494113ff5da51a0b9b0803","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/commits/4e9ef5af7919822c49494113ff5da51a0b9b0803","created_at":"2015-10-21T03:52:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":441482187,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ0MTQ4MjE4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/441482187","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-21T13:14:41Z","label":{"name":"Bug","color":"e11d21"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":441482223,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQ0MTQ4MjIyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/441482223","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-21T13:14:44Z","milestone":{"title":"4.1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":441541252,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQxNTQxMjUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/441541252","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url"
