I'm not sure if there's a reason it couldn't be done the other way round, but it seems a bit strange.\n\nUsing the [example from the Wiki](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki/Mapping-inheritance), I would like to be able to specify my inherited mappings from the derived class, such as:\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<Order, OrderDto>()\n      .ForMember(o=>o.Id, m=>m.MapFrom(s=>s.OrderId));\nMapper.CreateMap<OnlineOrder, OnlineOrderDto>()\n    .IncludeBase<Order, OrderDto>();\nMapper.CreateMap<MailOrder, MailOrderDto>()\n    .IncludeBase<Order, OrderDto>();\n```\n\nMy requirement for this stems from the fact that my derived classes often live in different assemblies, and therefore the mapping needs to be specified from the derived end.  It's unusual in inheritance for a base class to have any knowledge of the specific derived classes, so it would make sense that mappings can be specified this way too.\n\nI've seen [this extension](http://matthewmanela.com/blog/inheriting-base-type-mappings-with-automapper-extension/) which allows a base class to be included as a `.BeforeMap` extension, but this does not play nicely with `AssertConfigurationIsValid`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
