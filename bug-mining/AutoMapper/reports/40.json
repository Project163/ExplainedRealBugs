example, there are UserModel (string FirstName, string LastName) and UserDto(string FullName) classes.\nMapping is defined using AutoMapper.QueryableExtensions and is executed by Linq2Entities.\n\nMap creation code:\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<UserModel, UserDto>()\n    .ForMember(dto => dto.FullName, opt => opt.MapFrom(u => u.LastName + \" \" + u.FirstName));\n```\n\nNow look at the AutoMapper code snippet:\n\nMapEngine.cs, CreateMapExpression, line 245\n\n```\ncurrentChild = converter.Visit(((LambdaExpression)propertyMap.CustomExpression).Body);\nvar propertyInfo = propertyMap.SourceMember as PropertyInfo;\nif (propertyInfo != null)\n{\n    currentChildType = propertyInfo.PropertyType;\n}\n```\n\nWhen CreateMapExpression is processing FullName, propertyMap.SourceMember is null, currentChildType is not set, NullReferenceException is raised afterwards.\n\nI found a workaround adding this code:\n\n```\nelse\n{\n    currentChildType = currentChild.Type;\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
