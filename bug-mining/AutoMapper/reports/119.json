It passes expression to `MemberInfoFinderVisitor`, which enumerates expression tree and creates `PropertyGetter` for each `PropertyAccess` node. Problem is that `ExpressionVisitor` enumerates expression in this order (from example before):\n`Lambda`\n`.`\n`Data`\n`.`\n`NestedSource`\n`s`\nIn the same order properties passed to `ConstructorParameterMap`, which latter applies them to source model. During mapping it tryes to access property `Data` of class `SourceWrap` and fails.\nI think if you reverse `Members` list of `MemberInfoFinderVisitor` before passing it to `ConstructorParameterMap` it will partially solve the problem.\nBut there are still a problem if someone tryes to do something like that:\n`.ForCtorParam(\"data\", opt => opt.MapFrom(s => s.NestedSource.Data + s.SomeOtherData))`\nSo you probably should check if `sourceMember` expression is only accessing properties. Or just pass whole expression to `ConstructorParameterMap` and then compile it to access data from source member.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1047/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
