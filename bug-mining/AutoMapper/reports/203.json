I saw that you're targeting .NET Standard 2.0 again, I thought I could finally upgrade from v10.1.1 on my ASP.NET MVC 5 project on .NET Framework 4.8. While the project does build without any complaints, when I try to run the app locally via IIS, I get the following exception:\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> \n> Could not load file or assembly 'AutoMapper' or one of its dependencies. Strong name signature could not be verified.  The assembly may have been tampered with, or it was delay signed but not fully signed with the correct private key. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131045)\n\nI thought it was the binding redirects, but they should be fine:\n\n```xml\n<dependentAssembly>\n\t<assemblyIdentity name=\"AutoMapper\" publicKeyToken=\"be96cd2c38ef1005\" culture=\"neutral\" />\n\t<bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-15.0.0.0\" newVersion=\"15.0.0.0\" />\n</dependentAssembly>\n```\n\nThe IIS AppPool does target .NET v4.0.
