I realize that I can then manually readd the Items to the nested Map() call, but I believe it should happen automatically.\r\n\r\n(NOTE: The example below is extremely simplified. You may think, \"these mappings should just be handled through _____ (e.g. conventions)\", but just keep in mind the main point is that the IMappingOperationOptions.Items are lost.\r\n\r\n### Source/destination types\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class FromGarage\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic List<FromCar> FromCars { get; set; }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\npublic class ToGarage\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic List<ToCar> ToCars { get; set; }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\npublic class FromCar\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic int Id { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic string Name { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic Door Door { get; set; }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\npublic class ToCar\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic int Id { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic string Name { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic Door Door { get; set; }\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Mapping configuration\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nCreateMap<FromGarage, ToGarage>()\r\n                .ForMember(dest => dest.ToCars, opts => opts.MapFrom((src, dest, destVal, ctx) => \r\n                {\r\n                    var toCars= new List<ToCar>();\r\n\r\n                    ToCar toCar;\r\n                    foreach (var fromCar in src.FromCars)\r\n                    {\r\n// I KNOW I COULD PASS IN THE ITEM \"DOOR\" MANUALLY RIGHT HERE, BUT SHOULDN'T THIS HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY?\r\n                        toCar = ctx.Mapper.Map<ToCar>(fromCar);\r\n                        if (toCar == null)\r\n                            continue;\r\n\r\n                        toCars.Add(toCar);\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    return toCars;\r\n                }));\r\n\r\nCreateMap<FromCar, ToCar>()\r\n                .ConvertUsing((src, dest, ctx) =>\r\n                {\r\n                    ToCar toCar = null;\r\n\r\n                    if (fromCar.Name != null)\r\n                    {\r\n                        toCar.Id= fromCar.Id;\r\n                        toCar.Name = fromCar.Name;\r\n\r\n                            // ERROR OCCURS HERE.
