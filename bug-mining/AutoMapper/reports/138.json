The following mapping works in 4.2.1:\n\n```\nCreateMap<Person, PersonDTO>()\n    .ForMember(dest => dest.NameOfFirstBorn, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.Family.Children.FirstOrDefault().Name))\n    ;\n```\n\nIf `src.Family` is null, `.FirstOrDefault()` is never called and the destination receives a null.  In 5.0.0, AssertConfigurationIsValid still succeed, but when called with a source object where Family is null, a MappingException is generated with the inner message being `ArgumentNullException` from `FirstOrDefault`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1382/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
