Internally, constructor parameter maps and property maps are modeled as two completely separate objects (ConstructorParameterMap/PropertyMap). Convenience aside - there's no guarantee that the constructor parameter and member map to the same member, NOR any guarantee that the constructor parameter is even surfaced through a member to be mapped, NOR that AutoMapper even recognizes the destination member since it will skip read-only properties.\n\nThe most obvious behavior is to treat the two separately, otherwise you're up the creek without a paddle when your destination types _internals_ don't follow some convention.

AutoMapper appears to _always_ use name-based mapping (only) for constructor parameters. I.e., the value for a destination ctor argument \"x\" sems to always be taken directly from a source property \"x\" or \"X\", ignoring any ForMember mappings. I was confused by the fact that the member mapping is _additionally_ executed if the property has any setter, even private. Therefore, my statement about an inconsistency already existing between the ctor eligibility check and the ctor invocation was incorrect.\n\nNow, about whether to also use ForMember for ctor parameters or not. I think the most important point is that we need some way to customize ctor parameter mappings, for the same reasons why we need to customize property mappings. If this need is undisputed, then the approach that you (@jbogard) suggested can always be used and it always works correctly, no matter how the properties are implemented:\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<Src, Dest>()\n    .ForCtorParam(\"resolvedVal\", opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.Val)));\n```\n\nSince this is probably the best solution that always works, it is of course what AutoMapper should implement first. Unfortunately, this solution suffers from the big drawback of having to reference the ctor parameter as a string, with no compiler or tooling (refactoring) support at all (although you can detect errors while building the map). That's a pity, but for the general solution, I don't think it can be helped [^1].\n\nHowever, what about the (many) DTO scenarios, where objects are just plain data containers and properties really do match ctor parameter names? Couldn't AutoMapper allow me, as a programmer knowing that my objects follow my conventions, allow me to specify my ctor argument mappings by convention, too?\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<Src, Dest>()\n    .ForCtorParamMatching(src => src.ResolvedVal, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.Val)));\n```\n\nWith the other feature already in place, this would of course be trivial to implement (just use the member name as a string), while giving me refactoring and tooling support. But only if I choose to use it.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n[^1] For completeness' sake, here's an alternative that's also compiler-supported and refactoring-safe:\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<Src, Dest>()\n    .ConstructUsing(opt => new Dest (opt.MapFrom(src => src.Val)));\n```\n\nHowever, I don't like it because it is so verbose - it requires me to mention every single ctor parameter, even those I don't want to explicitly specify (e.g., using an `opt.MapDefault<int>()` method or something like that), it's more difficult to implement, and it doesn't fit AutoMapper's general API very well.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/68159634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fschmied","id":139564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTU2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/139564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied","html_url":"https://github.com/fschmied","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschmied/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":212130606,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEyMTMwNjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/212130606","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-26T21:48:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":212130607,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMjEzMDYwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/212130607","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-26T21:48:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":212638313,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDIxMjYzODMxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/212638313","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-29T22:03:46Z","milestone":{"title":"4.0.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":212638347,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxMjYzODM0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Luc
