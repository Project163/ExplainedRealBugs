Right now I do something like this:\n> \n> ```\n>             if (typeMap != null && typeMap.DestinationCtor != null)\n>                 return typeMap.DestinationCtor(context.SourceValue);\n> ```\n> \n> But that \"context\" variable has all of the contextual information, including the parent object.  I could modify that overload to take the ResolutionContext object instead.
