Max { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we're mapping from a null string value, it's returning 0 instead of null. Here's a test that recreates the issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Test]\r\npublic void Map_ReturnsNullIntForNullString()\r\n{\r\n\t// Arrange\r\n\tvar mapperConfig = new MapperConfiguration(cfg => cfg.CreateMap<Model, Dto>());\r\n\tvar mapper = mapperConfig.CreateMapper();\r\n\r\n\tvar model = new Model {Max = null};\r\n\r\n\t// Act\r\n\tvar dto = mapper.Map<Dto>(model);\r\n\r\n\t// Assert\r\n\tAssert.IsNull(dto.Max);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tested this against 5.2.0-alpha-01245 and the issue still exists.\r\n\r\nHere's a gist: https://gist.github.com/adam-resdiary/c69a75aebe644205e1301818ce011efb","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
