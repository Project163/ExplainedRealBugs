using `string.Equals` instead of `Name.Equals`.\n\n```\n(pm => string.Equals(pm.DestinationProperty.Name, destinationProperty.Name));\n```\n\nIt doesn't solve the problem however which falls back to the type `NulloMemberGetter`being assigned to the property map but without being setup in any way. It's properties are readonly and it has no constructor.\n\nhttps://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/blob/37f9d5682a91e119cca4326bbcabc5b1a0b92841/src/AutoMapper/Execution/MemberGetter.cs#L24\n\nAdding a short constructor that sets `Name` and `MemberType` gets around this and I can actually map stuff, it doesn't however care about the customized member mappings. This test \"seems to work\", but it's just because we map `A` from `A`.\n\n```\n[Fact]\npublic void Can_map_explicit_members() {\n    var config = new MapperConfiguration(cfg => cfg.CreateMap(typeof(Source<>), typeof(Dest<>)).ForMember(\"A\", from => from.MapFrom(\"A\")));\n\n    var source = new Source<int> {\n        A = 5\n    };\n\n    var dest = config.CreateMapper().Map<Source<int>, Dest<int>>(source);\n\n    dest.A.ShouldEqual(5);\n}\n```\n\nThe following however doesn't, it's still just `A` being mapped to `A`, `Value` is still 0.\n\n```\n[Fact]\npublic void Can_remap_explicit_members() {\n    var config = new MapperConfiguration(cfg => cfg.CreateMap(typeof(Source<>), typeof(Dest<>)).ForMember(\"Value\", from => from.MapFrom(\"A\")));\n\n    var source = new Source<int> {\n        A = 5\n    };\n\n    var dest = config.CreateMapper().Map<Source<int>, Dest<int>>(source);\n\n    dest.Value.ShouldEqual(5);\n}\n```\n\nAnd about here I got lost, there is just to much lambda/expression/reflection stuff everywhere to do a \"quick dig\" into the
