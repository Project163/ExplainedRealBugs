To do so, I'm creating a new class, ProfileMap, to be the analog to TypeMap and PropertyMap to represent the final configuration for a profile.\r\n\r\nThis also means that when we build a ProfileMap, I can examine the root configuration and anything set in your profile, to build the final picture. In order to do so, many of the defaults need to be removed in the Profile class, in addition to making some of the values nullable so that I can detect if they're set or not.\r\n\r\nThe final picture is a bit cleaner, with the ProfileMap class containing behavior of \"how do I create a TypeMap\", and the Profile class containing behavior of \"how do I gather Profile configuration\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1796/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":861878226,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg2MTg3ODIyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/861878226","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"feaf58544a4479a925c589debe2a7bc48675532c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/commits/feaf58544a4479a925c589debe2a7bc48675532c","created_at":"2016-11-16T22:10:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":863425146,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODYzNDI1MTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/863425146","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"feaf58544a4479a925c589debe2a7bc48675532c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/commits/feaf58544a4479a925c589debe2a7bc48675532c","created_at":"2016-11-17T20:28:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/489900137","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1712#issuecomment-489900137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1712","id":489900137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTkwMDEzNw==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T04:10:11Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T04:10:11Z","body":"This
