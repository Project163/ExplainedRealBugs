By default is regarded to be on. \nWe made three changes: \n- set the initial value of the UseDestinationValue to true (to reflect the current state and dont break anything)\n- regard its value in PropertyMap.GetDestinationValue (return null if false)\n- added a function in IMappingExpression to disable it\n  That way we preserve the current behaviour but introduce a way to go back to the old behaviour.\n\n(The change in TypeMapObjectMapperRegistry, seemed a nessesary fix to a hidden bug, revealed by our change. UseDestinationValue does not need to be regarded when setting the value).\n\nPlease consider this fix.
