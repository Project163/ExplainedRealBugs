The good support for tree structures is one of the most compelling reasons I use Automapper to begin with, as opposed to just using a LINQ .Select() expression.\nIf the child collection of the SourceType and DestType structures had different sorting applied, this would cause walking the tree of the two structures in sync particularly painful to do correctly and would likely require intermediate data structures.\nI can think of numerous, though mostly small ways that doing it manually, as in your example, would require more work and more code.  Individually, I don't think many of them are compelling reasons, but taken together, I believe they could save a significant amount of work and mistakes for users of the library.  Most individual steps that Automapper follows when processing a mapping could be done 'easily' by hand, but it seems like the overall purpose of Automapper is specifically to attempt to eliminate as many of these manual steps as possible.\nAnyway, it was just a thought and if you don't think it fits into your vision of the library, I understand.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/41331022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cherrydev","id":1072616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1072616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev","html_url":"https://github.com/cherrydev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrydev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/41399392","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/503#issuecomment-41399392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/503","id":41399392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzk5Mzky","user":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-25T14:36:50Z","updated_at":"2014-04-25T14:36:50Z","body":"Ah, so AfterMap gets called on each level?
