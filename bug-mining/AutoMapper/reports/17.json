I received no exception, the mapping simply didn't occur.\n\nThe expected behavior would be that all properties get mapped. If this isn't possible for some reason, at least an exception should be thrown to alert the programmer that the mapping failed.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nprivate void MapTest(DisplayModel displayModel) // displayModel has a property Radius = 300\n{\n    object vm = new SomeViewModel();\n    Mapper.Map(displayModel, vm);\n    Debug.Assert(((SomeViewModel)vm).Radius == 300); // fails\n\n    var vm2 = new SomeViewModel();\n    Mapper.Map(displayModel, vm2);\n    Debug.Assert(((SomeViewModel)vm2).Radius == 300); // succeeds\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
