What I want is a list of grandparentviewmodels that have only the grandparent name, but also has a list of grandchild objects....not a list of parent objects....ie....\"give me the grandparent and all their grandchildren regardless of which parent they are a child of\".\n\nIn order to try to get this working, I have used the ConvertUsing method and have created a class that implements the ITypeConverter interface.   Everything builds, but I can't get the mapping to work....the breakpoints I am setting in the TypeConverter class do not get hit and I can't figure out what I am doing wrong.\n\nI created a stackoverflow question for this, but it isn't getting any action so hoping this forum helps.  [Here is the SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36344338/flatten-linq-automapper-projectto-nested-children).  And below are snippets of the code I have:\n\n```\npublic class GrandparentConverter : ITypeConverter<Grandparent, GrandparentViewModel>\n{\n    public GrandparentViewModel Convert(ResolutionContext context)\n    {\n        var entities = context.SourceValue as Grandparent;\n\n        return entities\n            .Select(x => new GrandparentViewModel\n            {\n                GrandparentId = x.GrandparentId,\n                Name = x.Name,\n                Grandchildren = AutoMapper.Mapper.Map<IEnumerable<Parent>, List<ChildViewModel>>(x.Parents)\n            }).ToList();\n\n        //return new GrandparentViewModel\n        //{\n        //    GrandparentId = entities.GrandparentId,\n        //    Name = entities.Name,\n        //    Grandchildren = entities.Parents.SelectMany(x => x.Children.Select(y => new ChildViewModel\n        //    {\n        //        ChildId = y.ChildId,\n        //        Name = y.Name\n        //    }).ToList()).ToList()\n        //};\n    }\n}\n\n\npublic class ChildConverter : ITypeConverter<IEnumerable<Parent>, List<ChildViewModel>>\n{\n    public List<ChildViewModel> Convert(ResolutionContext context)\n    {\n        var entities = context.SourceValue as IEnumerable<Parent>;\n\n        return entities\n            .SelectMany(x => x.Children)\n            .Select(x => new ChildViewModel\n            {\n                ChildId = x.ChildId,\n                Name = x.Name\n            }).ToList();\n    }\n} \n\n....surrounding code removed as it isn't relevant....\nMapperConfiguration mapper = new MapperConfiguration(cfg =>\n        {\n            cfg.CreateMap<Child, ChildViewModel>();\n            cfg.CreateMap<IEnumerable<Parent>, List<ChildViewModel>>().ConvertUsing<ChildConverter>();\n\n            cfg.CreateMap<Grandparent, GrandparentViewModel>();\n            cfg.CreateMap<IEnumerable<Grandparent>, List<GrandparentViewModel>>().ConvertUsing<GrandparentConverter>();\n        });\n\n        FamilyEntities db = new FamilyEntities();\n        List<GrandparentViewModel> entities = db.Set<Grandparent>()\n            .Where(x => x.GrandparentId == 1)\n            .ProjectTo<GrandparentViewModel>(mapper)\n            .ToList();\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/1216/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
