`System.Int32`.\r\n`Mapper.Map<FooDto>(new Foo())` also works as expected.\r\nIt does not matter if I use the static configuration method or create an instance of mapper and pass it to ProjectTo().\r\n\r\nIf I adjust the configuration like this:\r\n```\r\n        Mapper.Initialize(cfg =>\r\n        {\r\n            cfg.CreateMap<Foo, FooDto>().ForMember(\r\n                dto => dto.A,\r\n                conf => conf.MapFrom(foo => foo.A));\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error goes away.
