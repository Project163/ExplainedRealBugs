this unfortunately this is a massive breaking change. If you are going to change the assembly manifest this should be on a major version. Sure, if people rebuild their projects there shouldn't be an issue but for projects like CMS's that use Automapper, they cannot ship with the new version because all plugins built for it will no longer work. This should have been a version 4.0 change. We use Automapper in Umbraco but this means we won't be able to upgrade to 3.1 + until we release a new major version. ... and anyone that decides they want to do a Update-Package AutoMapper will unfortunately get upgraded to a DLL that will break their site since the assembly manifest is different and binding redirects won't work because of the public key change.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/127644405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Shazwazza","id":1742685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza","html_url":"https://github.com/Shazwazza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/127658789","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/373#issuecomment-127658789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/373","id":127658789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzY1ODc4OQ==","user":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-04T15:59:53Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T15:59:53Z","body":"Yeah if I could undo that SN removal I would have (now a mistake over 2 years old).
