Pretty nasty as the only error you see subsequently on AppHarbor is a \"403 - Forbidden: Access Denied\" from IIS with no additional debug information as the web application failed even to load.\n\nIt

The package file contents are then deployed to the QA server. This is an exception I only see in our QA environment where we don't have Visual Studio installed.\n\nThe issue seems to be that we are not deploying Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure.dll.\n\nWhen I looked at the Autofac.Mvc5.nuspec file in the Autofac.Mvc5 nuget package version 3.3.2 I saw that the declared dependencies are Autofac version [3.4.0, 4.0.0) and Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc version [5.1.0, 6.0.0).\n\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<package xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\">\n  <metadata xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd\">\n    <id>Autofac.Mvc5</id>\n    <version>$AFversion_Autofac.Mvc5$</version>\n    <authors>Autofac Contributors</authors>\n    <licenseUrl>http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php</licenseUrl>\n    <requireLicenseAcceptance>false</requireLicenseAcceptance>\n    <description>ASP.NET MVC 5 Integration for Autofac</description>\n    <summary>Provides an IDependencyResolver implementation and other integration points for System.Web.Mvc.</summary>\n    <language>en-US</language>\n    <title>Autofac ASP.NET MVC 5 Integration</title>\n    <projectUrl>http://autofac.org</projectUrl>\n    <iconUrl>http://code.google.com/p/autofac/logo</iconUrl>\n    <dependencies>\n      <dependency id=\"Autofac\" version=\"[3.4.0,4.0.0)\" />\n      <dependency id=\"Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc\" version=\"[5.1.0,6.0.0)\" />\n    </dependencies>\n  </metadata>\n</package>\n```\n\nWhen I looked at the Autofac.Integration.Mvc\\packages.config file, it seems like there are more assemblies from the NuGet packages folder that are direct dependencies of the Autofac.Mvc5 NuGet package.\n\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<packages>\n  <package id=\"Autofac\" version=\"3.4.0\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n  <package id=\"Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc\" version=\"5.1.0\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n  <package id=\"Microsoft.AspNet.Razor\" version=\"3.1.0\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n  <package id=\"Microsoft.AspNet.WebPages\" version=\"3.1.0\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n  <package id=\"Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure\" version=\"1.0.0.0\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n</packages>\n```\n\nTo fix this issue, Microsoft.AspNet.Razor, Microsoft.AspNet.WebPages, and Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure should be dependencies of the Autofac.Mvc5 NuGet package.\n\nOne other thing: when I looked at the Autofac.Integration.Mvc.dll in Telerik JustDecompile I saw that of \nthe assemblies Microsoft.AspNet.Razor, Microsoft.AspNet.WebPages, and Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure, only Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure is actually referenced. Is this an indication that Microsoft.AspNet.Razor and Microsoft.AspNet.WebPages do not need to be referenced by Autofac.Integration.Mvc?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autofac/Autofac/issues/574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autofac/Autofac/issues/574/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/490428526","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/556#issuecomment-490428526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/556","id":490428526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDQyODUyNg==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T10:06:33Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T10:06:33Z","body":"This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
