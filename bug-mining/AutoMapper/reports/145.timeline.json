Here's the other one.\n\nThere are quite a lot of mappings in our project that are, by the standards of 5.0.0, pretty broken. For one thing, there are static calls to `Mapper.Map()` inside the configurations; those I'm working on removing.\n\nBut there are also mapping targets which have private constructors written explicitly to allow AutoMapper 2.2.1 to construct the objects and then map properties from some DTO. Many of these now throw runtime errors at mapping time with the pretty uninformative error message\n\n> System.ArgumentException: MyProject.Foo.DestinationType needs to have a constructor with 0 args or only optional args\n\nSince these errors aren't discovered by the configuration verification, we're pretty screwed; we don't have test coverage that excercises all possible mappings, so we won't find all of these until someone stumbles on them in production. Unless this can be resolved, this is pretty much a dealbreaker for our upgrade
