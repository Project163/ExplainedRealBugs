But the problem I then ran into is that if Sub is null in your example, then the whole thing is null. With AutoMapper, it tries to make sure that you don't get null values in your results.\n\nIf you want to handle a missing \"Sub\", your query has to look totally different. Joins, \"DefaultIfEmpty\" and so on.\n\nWhy not just flatten?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/22917936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/22944760","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/358#issuecomment-22944760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/358","id":22944760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTQ0NzYw","user":{"login":"leftler","id":1425499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjU0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler","html_url":"https://github.com/leftler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-20T13:32:06Z","updated_at":"2013-08-20T13:32:06Z","body":"Flattening is the workaround I went with in my actual project.
