ated_at":"2015-08-21T21:24:32Z","body":"@jbogard, I'm sorry for the delay.\n\n> AutoMapper has two modes, projection and mapping. Projection uses only expressions to map, and mapping can do waaaaaaaay more things. Though your two code snippets look the same, one uses Func and one uses Expression.\n\nThat's absolutelly correct.\nIndeed, as I have like 30 enums, I made this method to create my enum mappings:\n\n```\nprotected void CreateEnumMap<TEnum1, TEnum2>(Expression<System.Func<TEnum1, TEnum2>> exp,\n    Expression<System.Func<TEnum2, TEnum1>> reverseExp, bool createReverse = true)\n{\n    var map = CreateMap<TEnum1, TEnum2>();\n    map.ConvertUsing(exp.Compile());\n    map.ProjectUsing(exp);\n\n    if (createReverse) CreateEnumMap(reverseExp, exp, false);\n}\n```\n\n> The piece that executes the mapping are also completely separate. The projection doesn't actually map anything\n\nThat I'm not sure. I didn't dig into this part of the AutoMapper code, but as an AutoMapper user perspective I see that:\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<Source, Destination>();\nMapper.Map<Source, Destination>(source); //this works\n```\n\n```\nMapper.CreateMap<Source, Destination>();\nMapper.CreateMap<SourceType, DestinationType>().ProjectUsing(s => (DestinationType)s);\nMapper.Map<Source, Destination>(source); //this doesn't work correctly\n```\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is AutoMapper creates the expression tree to enum-enum projections.\nThen creating enum-enum mapping wouldn't be necessary to map and project.\n\nIn my large AutoMapper config, I just call .ProjectUsing() and .ConvertUsing() with enums.\nThat's a problem to maintenance, because I need treat class and enum separetely.\n\nI map and project two POCO classes (with same property names), just callling `CreateMap<Source, Destination>()`.\n\nOn the other hand, to enum I don't need to call CreateMap<> to use mapping.\nBut if I project it, I need to call `CreateMap<>` and `ProjectUsing`\nEven worse, If I map and project it, I need to call `CreateMap<>`, `ProjectUsing` and `ConvertUsing`.\n\nIt's not a clear behavior to me and the documentation doesn't explain that.\nDo you agree?

per #840 (in part!), when using QueryableExtensions it would be nice if declared projection rules were picked up for normal mapping too. \n\nThe API raises expectations that this should happen already, as ProjectUsing returns void and doesn't allow any run-on clauses: it's final, and seems like it declares everything that needs to be declared. When Mapper.Map is then inadvertently used alongside projections, and it throws an exception, the innocent user may blame AutoMapper and convince himself that something is broken, rather than suspecting his own misunderstanding of the API.\n\nTherefore I've changed the comment on ProjectUsing to be a little more explicit, and also exposed a new ProjectAndConvertUsing method that does as you'd expect.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":400051679,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQwMDA1MTY3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/400051679","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-03T13:26:29Z","milestone":{"title":"4.1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":400051862,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQwMDA1MTg2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/400051862","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-03T13:26:40Z","label":{"name":"Improvement","color":"207de5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":400052242,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDAwMDUyMjQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/events/400052242","actor":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"70aa2eddee65dd3c816229ef4e4ea735034e6f49","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/commits/70aa2eddee65dd3c816229ef4e4ea735034e6f49","created_at":"2015-09-03T13:26:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/comments/490329334","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/840#issuecomment-490329334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/840","id":490329334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDMyOTMzNA==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"http
