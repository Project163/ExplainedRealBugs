I frequently have been finding myself having to iterate or walk through a list or tree after performing a mapping operation on it in order to manipulate it in a manner that has local context (data not contained in the source list).  It would be more convenient to be able to  do something like:\n\n``` csharp\nMapper.Map<SourceType, DestType>(sourceList, e => e.AfterMap(delegate(SourceType a, DestType b)\n{\n   /// Do some manipulation here\n});\n```\n\nWould this be useful to anyone else, or does it look like I'm approaching this in the wrong way somehow?  This could perhaps be added IMappingOperations, though that might be a bit clunky.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbogard","id":104498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard","html_url":"https://github.com/jbogard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbogard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LuckyPennySoftware/AutoMapper/issues/503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
