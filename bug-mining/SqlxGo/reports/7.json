This is a bug, because it's contrary to reasonable expectations, ie:\n\n``` go\n\ntype Foo struct {\n    Name string\n}\n\n// can set 'Name' on this struct\ntype Place struct {\n    Foo\n}\n\n// cannot set 'Name' on this struct\ntype Person struct {\n    *Foo\n}\n```\n\nCurrently, when you scan into a nil pointer, database/sql allocates the space for you.  This is how `[]byte` and `string` work as well;  a new one will always be allocated.  I'm going to copy this behavior, even though it's not well known, because I don't want `StructScan` to behave differently and because I think it could end up creating incredibly difficult to figure out bugs.\n\nThe `setValues` function can allocate these using reflect.\n\nNote that all this per-row allocation is going to cost a little something, so if speed is a priority I recommend against pointer embeds.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/35/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
