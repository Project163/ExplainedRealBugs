This prevents JSONText from being embedded into a larger, Marshal()-able struct like so:\n\n```\ntype MyThing struct {\n  MyField int\n  MySubField JSONText \n}\n```\n\nCalls to json.Marshal(MyThing) will fail since MySubField won't have a pointer receiver in this context. Instead `encoding/json` will interpret the field as a `[]byte` and marshal it into a base64 string, e.g.:\n\n```\n{\n  \"MyField\": 0,\n  \"MySubField\": \"bnVsbA==\" \n}\n```\n\nOne simple solution might be to drop the pointer from the method:\n\n```\n--- a/go/src/_vendor/github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/types/types.go\n+++ b/go/src/_vendor/github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/types/types.go\n@@ -56,7 +56,7 @@ func (g *GzippedText) Scan(src interface{}) error {\n type JSONText json.RawMessage\n\n // MarshalJSON returns the *j as the JSON encoding of j.\n-func (j *JSONText) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {\n+func (j JSONText) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {\n        return j, nil\n }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
