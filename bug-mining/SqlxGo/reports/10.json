here is the test code that is failing for me:\n\n```\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"database/sql\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    _ \"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\"\n    \"github.com/jmoiron/sqlx\"\n    // _ \"github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3\"\n    \"log\"\n)\n\nvar schema = `\nCREATE TABLE person (\n    first_name text NULL,\n    last_name text NULL,\n    email text NULL\n);\n`\n\ntype Person struct {\n    FirstName sql.NullString `db:\"first_name\"`\n    LastName  sql.NullString `db:\"last_name\"`\n    Email     sql.NullString\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    //db, err := sqlx.Connect(\"sqlite3\", \"/tmp/sqlxbugtest.db\")\n    db, err := sqlx.Connect(\"mysql\", fmt.Sprintf(\"%s:%s@/%s?parseTime=true\", \"sqlx\", \"sqlx\", \"sqlxtest\"))\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    db.Execl(\"drop table person\")\n    db.Execf(schema)\n\n    p := Person{\n        FirstName: sql.NullString{\"ben\", true},\n        LastName:  sql.NullString{\"doe\", true},\n        Email:     sql.NullString{\"ben@doe.com\", true},\n    }\n    _, err = db.NamedExec(\"INSERT INTO person (first_name, last_name, email) VALUES (:first_name, :last_name, :email)\", p)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    p2 := &Person{}\n    rows, err := db.NamedQuery(\"SELECT * FROM person WHERE first_name=:first_name\", p)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    for rows.Next() {\n        err = rows.StructScan(p2)\n        if err != nil {\n            log.Fatal(err)\n        }\n        if p2.FirstName.String != \"ben\" {\n            log.Fatal(\"Expected first name of `ben`, got \" + p2.FirstName.String)\n        }\n        if p2.LastName.String != \"doe\" {\n            log.Fatal(\"Expected first name of `doe`, got \" + p2.LastName.String)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere is the output:\n\n```\n2014/01/03 22:42:18 Expected first name of `doe`, got 1\nexit status 1\n```\n\nThis is what the mysql database looks like:\n\n```\nfirst_name, last_name, email\n'ben', '1', NULL\n```\n\nSo basically, I can get this to work by doing 1 of any of the following things:\n- Change `p := Person {...` to `p := &Person {...`\n- Change all `sql.NullString` to `string` \n- Use sqlite3 instead of mysql\n\nI'm not entirely sure why this is failing, but I found this in my production code.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/40/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/40/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
