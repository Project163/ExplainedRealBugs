It's an oversight with the new scalar/base-type support in Get.\n\nSome structs are supported by drivers despite not implementing `driver.Valuer`.  I can special case `time.Time` because it's common; there is pq and mysql support for scanning to it.  I wonder if there's a more generic check like \"has no exported fields.\"\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/comments/55412259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/comments/55412648","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/84#issuecomment-55412648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/84","id":55412648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDEyNjQ4","user":{"login":"medovina","id":673039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MzAzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/673039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina","html_url":"https://github.com/medovina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medovina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-12T14:42:25Z","updated_at":"2014-09-12T14:42:25Z","body":"OK - I'm glad to hear you can special case time.Time if necessary since it seems like a fundamental type.
