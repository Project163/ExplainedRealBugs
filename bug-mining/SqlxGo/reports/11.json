For example here I set up a database to have a name (string) and age(int):\n\n```\n+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| Field | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |\n+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| name  | varchar(255) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |\n| age   | int(11)      | NO   |     | NULL    |       |\n+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n+------+-----+\n| name | age |\n+------+-----+\n| bob  |  10 |\n+------+-----+\n```\n\nI then use sqlx to read out the values into a struct, but the struct has the wrong types.\n\n```\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"log\"\n  \"github.com/jmoiron/sqlx\"\n  _ \"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\"\n)\n\n// in database name is a string and age is an int\n\ntype Person struct{\n  Name int\n  Age string\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  sqlSession, err := sqlx.Open(\"mysql\", \"root:@(localhost:3306)/dashboard?parseTime=true\")\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Panic(err)\n  }\n  err = sqlSession.Ping()\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Panic(err)\n  }\n  query := \"SELECT * FROM test\"\n  rows, errSql := sqlSession.Queryx(query)\n  if errSql != nil {\n    log.Panic(errSql)\n  }\n  for rows.Next() {\n    var p Person\n    errScan := rows.StructScan(&p)\n    if errScan != nil {\n      log.Panic(errScan)\n    }\n    log.Println(\"Person:\", p)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo instead of giving me an error, it has zeroed out values. Person: {0 }\nI feel this is a bug of some kind. \n\nP.S. sqlx is very useful, thank you for writing it\n","closed_by":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
