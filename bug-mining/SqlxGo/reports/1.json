I got back a really ugly panic:\n\nreflect.(_rtype).Elem(...)\n    /home/nate/go/src/pkg/reflect/type.go:584 +0x118\ngithub.com/jmoiron/sqlx.StructScan(...)\n    /home/nate/code/go/src/github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/sqlx.go:761 +0x1b4\ngithub.com/jmoiron/sqlx.Select(...)\n    /home/nate/code/go/src/github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/sqlx.go:508 +0xbe\ngithub.com/jmoiron/sqlx.(_DB).Select(...)\n    /home/nate/code/go/src/github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/sqlx.go:160 +0x71\n\nThere seem to be a couple ways to handle this with better results:\n\n1.) Allow this to work, just check to see if the thing passed in is a struct, and if so, just scan the first returned row\n2.) Don't allow it to work, but handle the error with a more friendly error message\n\nfor #2, it might also be beneficial to rename the parameter as something like dest_slice ... to make it a little more obvious that it requires a slice.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
