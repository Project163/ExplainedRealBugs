The named query parsing should be modified to allow for that by allowing the `::` escape to mean a single `:` in the result query.  This follows from the sql standard's `''` to escape `'` inside string literals.\n\nThis will be unlikely to have much impact on current uses of sqlx;  there is no valid use of `::` currently for named statements.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/91/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/91/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
