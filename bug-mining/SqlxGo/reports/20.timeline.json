There are two changes I could make here:\n1. panic right away if a non-Stmt (either sql or sqlx style) is passed to `tx.Stmtx`\n2. use a Stmt-ish interface to prevent something completely nonsensical from passing compilation\n\nI do think this is a panic-able offence, so I'm fine with adding 1 regardless to address this particular issue.  \n\n2 is technically a breaking change, but it would be unlikely to break any currently functioning code;  the only thing I can think of is passing an explicitly created `interface{}` value for a Stmt here.  I try pretty hard not to break peoples code but if I have to to improve the library I prefer it to either work 100% compatibly or issue a trivial compiler error.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/comments/152870256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":464290741,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDY0MjkwNzQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/events/464290741","actor":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"a60eb2e96cd6c4a4de21c0e25e94c3def8de8556","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/commits/a60eb2e96cd6c4a4de21c0e25e94c3def8de8556","created_at":"2015-11-14T03:45:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/comments/156621599","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/182#issuecomment-156621599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/182","id":156621599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjYyMTU5OQ==","user":{"login":"jmoiron","id":218132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoiron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoiron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-14T03:50:28Z","updated_at":"2015-11-14T03:50:28Z","body":"I'm going to leave off the 2nd bit of this for now.
