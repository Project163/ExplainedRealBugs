This causes a run-time error about `nlohmann_json_schema_validator.dll` being missing.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n- OS: Windows\r\n- Compiler: MSVC\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. `./vcpkg install json-schema-validator`\r\n2. Use `\"VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET\": \"x64-windows\"` in CMake project.\r\n3. Setup CMake and program to use the library as normal from examples.\r\n4. Attempt to run your program.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe program should run without an error about a missing DLL.\r\n\r\n**Failure logs**\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/assets/5551512/b3bad9a3-f7ea-4897-87a8-a6f335fe6169)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nPerhaps this flag from the [library's documentation](https://github.com/pboettch/json-schema-validator#building-as-shared-library) needs added when being dynamically linked.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume this also affects the production of a `.so` file on Linux.","closed_by":{"login":"JavierMatosD","id":44559473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTU5NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44559473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD","html_url":"https://github.com/JavierMatosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
