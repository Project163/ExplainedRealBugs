Please describe.\r\n\r\nCurrently, cairo is always dependent on lzo with no way to disable it, even though it is an optional dependency in cairo's build script.\r\nThe problem arises from the open-source version of lzo, available via vcpkg, being licensed under GPL 2.0+. This makes all versions of cairo from v1.16.0#11 onwards impossible to use in a closed-source commercial application, even though cairo itself is very well suited for that as it is licensed under LGPL 2.1 or MPL 1.1.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nMove the hard lzo dependency to a feature that can be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nWe couldn't find a suitable solution other than creating an overlay port in our internal vcpkg registry that must be maintained for each new version.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"JavierMatosD","id":44559473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTU5NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44559473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD","html_url":"https://github.com/JavierMatosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
