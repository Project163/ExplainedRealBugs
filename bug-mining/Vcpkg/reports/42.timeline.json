I attempted to build DevilutionX on my laptop for the first time in a long while, I encountered the error described in https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38947.\r\n\r\nFrom what I gathered, the vcpkg port for libsodium 1.0.19 was pointed to the `1.0.19` tag in libsodium which is a moving target. The tag changed, which invalidated their hash. They fixed it by targeting the `1.0.20-RELEASE` tag which is a more stable target, but it does nothing to resolve the 1.0.19 hash.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has already downloaded the 1.0.19 package should be unaffected. Anyone who hasn't already downloaded it is going to encounter the error and be unable to build. So we don't have much choice but to update.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diasurgical/DevilutionX/issues/7125/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diasurgical/DevilutionX/issues/7125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dg0yt","id":13567791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTY3Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13567791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt","html_url":"https://github.com/dg0yt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dg0yt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-06T19:41:42Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T19:41:42Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/40314","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/40314/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/40314/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/40314/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/40314","id":2451517361,"node_id":"I_kwDOBBJcqc6SHy-x","number":40314,"title":"[libsodium]
