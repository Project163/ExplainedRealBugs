Possible causes are:\r\n      \r\n      1. You are actually using an HTTP proxy, but setting HTTPS_PROXY variable\r\n         to `https://address:port`. This is not correct, because `https://` prefix\r\n         claims the proxy is an HTTPS proxy, while your proxy (v2ray, shadowsocksr\r\n         , etc..) is an HTTP proxy. Try setting `http://address:port` to both\r\n         HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY instead.\r\n      \r\n      2. If you are using Windows, vcpkg will automatically use your Windows IE Proxy Settings\r\n         set by your proxy software. See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/77\r\n         The value set by your proxy might be wrong, or have same `https://` prefix issue.\r\n      \r\n      3. Your proxy's remote server is out of service.\r\n      \r\n      If you've tried directly download the link, and believe this is not a temporary\r\n      download server failure, please submit an issue at https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues\r\n      to report this upstream download server failure.\r\n      \r\n\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  scripts/cmake/vcpkg_download_distfile.cmake:270 (z_vcpkg_download_distfile_show_proxy_and_fail)\r\n  scripts/cmake/vcpkg_from_github.cmake:106 (vcpkg_download_distfile)\r\n  ports/libsodium/portfile.cmake:1 (vcpkg_from_github)\r\n  scripts/ports.cmake:175 (include)\r\n\r\n\r\nerror: building libsodium:x64-windows-static failed with: BUILD_FAILED\r\nElapsed time to handle libsodium:x64-windows-static: 807 ms\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe cited url `https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/archive/1.0.19.tar.gz` does not point to the actual release, but to a tag that is used like a branch.\r\nUse 1.0.19-RELEASE tag OR better, the signed release tarballs instead `https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/download/1.0.19-RELEASE/libsodium-1.0.19.tar.gz`\r\n\r\nAlso, 1.0.20 released yesterday, probably triggering this issue.","closed_by":{"login":"vicroms","id":3526662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjY2NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3526662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms","html_url":"https://github.com/vicroms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicroms/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38947/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38947/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
