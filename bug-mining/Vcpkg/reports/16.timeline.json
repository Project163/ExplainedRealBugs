`CMake` version `3.29.2` reverted these changes in [Kitware - CMake - 9420](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests/9420), closed this issue.\r\n\r\nSee [Kitware - CMake - 25873](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/25873) and [Kitware - CMake - 25827](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/25827)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFix #37968.\r\n\r\nFunction `vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup` in `vcpkg-cmake-config` cannot adjust the prefix for `CMake` version `3.29.1` because the module `CMakePackageConfigHelpers` altered package config `PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR` to \"package name and a global counter\" at [Kitware - CMake - !9390](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests/9390).\r\n\r\nAdd replacement for new formats to fix it.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] Changes comply with the [maintainer guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-docs/blob/main/vcpkg/contributing/maintainer-guide.md).\r\n- [x] SHA512s are updated for each updated download.\r\n- [ ] ~The \"supports\" clause reflects platforms that may be fixed by this new version.~\r\n- [ ] ~Any fixed [CI baseline](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/scripts/ci.baseline.txt) entries are removed from that file.~\r\n- [ ] ~Any patches that are no longer applied are deleted from the port's directory.~\r\n- [x] The version database is fixed by rerunning `./vcpkg x-add-version --all` and committing the result.\r\n- [x] Only one version is added to each modified port's versions file.\r\n\r\n### Test\r\nPort `tinyobjloader` usage tests pass for `CMake` version `3.29.0` and `3.29.1`\r\n* The config file in `lib/tinyobjloader/cmake` was moved to `share/tinyobjloader`.\r\n* The `get_filename_component` prefix was modified to the correct deepness.\r\n  * For `3.29.0`, `get_filename_component(PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../\" ABSOLUTE)`\r\n  * For `3.29.1`, `get_filename_component(PACKAGE_${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME}_COUNTER_1 \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../\" ABSOLUTE)`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Cheney-W","id":38240633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjQwNjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38240633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W","html_url":"https://github.com/Cheney-W","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cheney-W/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-07T06:17:00Z","updated_at":"2024-04-07T06:17:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38008","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38008/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38008/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38008/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38008","id":2229273645,"node_id":"I_kwDOBBJcqc6E4AQt","number":38008,"title":"[liblzma]
