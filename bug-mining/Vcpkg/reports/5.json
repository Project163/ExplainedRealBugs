the bug**\r\n\r\nAfter GitHub actions runners were updated to use cmake 3.29.1 (https://github.com/actions/runner-images/releases/tag/ubuntu20%2F20240407.1), our builds of ParquetSharp, which depends on re2, have started failing due to this issue in re2: https://github.com/google/re2/issues/488.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by this change in cmake: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/commit/6ddf8712cdcc1b548af4b502ea91e94cf0bf4f0b\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\nI've reproduced this in my local dev environment:\r\n- OS: Fedora Linux 39\r\n- Compiler: gcc 13.2.1\r\n- Cmake: 3.29.1\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nBuild a project that uses re2:\r\n\r\nvcpkg.json:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vcpkg/master/scripts/vcpkg.schema.json\",\r\n  \"name\": \"re2-build-test\",\r\n  \"version-string\": \"undefined\",\r\n  \"builtin-baseline\": \"0bc3f04da6cb8ae1dbd5e2051032c596bb03cffa\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [\r\n    \"re2\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCMakeLists.txt:\r\n```\r\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)\r\n\r\nproject(re2-build-test VERSION 0.1 LANGUAGES CXX)\r\n\r\nfind_package(re2 CONFIG REQUIRED)\r\n\r\nadd_executable(program src/main.cc)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(program PRIVATE re2::re2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nsrc/main.cc:\r\n```\r\nint main() {\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild with vcpkg:\r\n```\r\ncmake -B build -S . -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake\r\ncmake --build build\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe program should build successfully.\r\n\r\n**Failure logs**\r\n\r\nBuilding and installing re2 itself works, but then building the local program fails with:\r\n```\r\nCMake Error at build/vcpkg_installed/x64-linux/share/re2/re2Config.cmake:15 (message):\r\n  File or directory /include referenced by variable re2_INCLUDE_DIR does not                                                                                   \r\n  exist !                                                                      \r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):                                           \r\n  build/vcpkg_installed/x64-linux/share/re2/re2Config.cmake:33 (set_and_check)\r\n  /home/adam/dev/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:859 (_find_package)\r\n  CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package)   \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe line causing the error in `build/vcpkg_installed/x64-linux/share/re2/re2Config.cmake` is:\r\n```\r\nset_and_check(re2_INCLUDE_DIR ${PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR}/include)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR` is not defined.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed upstream in re2: https://github.com/google/re2/commit/9ebe4a22cad8a025b68a9594bdff3c047a111333\r\n\r\nWould you accept a patch to backport this fix for the current version of re2 in vcpkg?\r\n\r\nIf not, we can work around this by using our own port of re2 with a patch, or install an older version of cmake on our GitHub action runners, but it seems likely that other users will run into this too.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JavierMatosD","id":44559473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTU5NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44559473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD","html_url":"https://github.com/JavierMatosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38064/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
