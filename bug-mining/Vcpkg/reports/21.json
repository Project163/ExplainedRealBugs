These roughly correspond to `vcpkg` features.\r\n\r\nA small number of libraries in `google-cloud-cpp` use `_` in their names. As `_` is not valid in `vcpkg` features, these are mapped to `vcpkg` features with `-` in their names. For example, to install the `dialogflow_es` library one would say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvcpkg install google-cloud-cpp[core,dialogflow-es]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe port script correctly builds and installs the '*.a' and headers, but fails to install the `*.cmake` files correctly. In the previous example, vcpkg will try to find `google_cloud_cpp_dialogflow-es/*.cmake`, but should be trying to find `google_cloud_cpp_dialogflow_es` (note that **last** dash is replaced to an underscore).\r\n\r\nI will try to send a PR.","closed_by":{"login":"JavierMatosD","id":44559473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTU5NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44559473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD","html_url":"https://github.com/JavierMatosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierMatosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/38442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
