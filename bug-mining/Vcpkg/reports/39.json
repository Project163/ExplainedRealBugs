The build itself is successful so the issue must be in the provided CMake files. On Linux it works\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n- OS: Windows 11\r\n- Compiler: MSVC 19.37.32822 under Visual Studio Community 2022 17.7.3\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nAdd \"avcpp\" to vcpkg.json dependencies and in CMakeLists.txt `find_package(avcpp CONFIG REQUIRED)`, then link `avcpp::avcpp` and `avcpp::FFmpeg` to your target. I used it in Visual Studio (opening the project with \"open folder\") but I expect the same to happen with standalone CMake. I'm using vcpkg in manifest mode as a git submodule\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should work\r\n\r\n**Failure logs**\r\nCMake failure:\r\n```\r\n1> [CMake] CMake Error at build/debug/vcpkg_installed/x64-windows/share/avcpp/avcpp-targets.cmake:61 (set_target_properties):\r\n1> [CMake]   The link interface of target \"avcpp::avcpp\" contains:\r\n1> [CMake] \r\n1> [CMake]     Threads::Threads\r\n1> [CMake] \r\n1> [CMake]   but the target was not found.
