I was going to write that feature in our app, so I was excited to see that you already had. Thanks! Like the time when I thought \"oh, we should use bcrypt for our passwords\" only to discover that Devise already did, I've yet again found that you thought of and implemented something before I realized I needed it. :)\n\nOne request: for re-confirmation, it would be nice to be able to use a different email template. Our current confirmation template says \"Welcome to #{name of app}!\" I like that, but it's an odd message for someone who is just updating their email address. So now I  have to choose: welcome them again, or alter the confirmation email to be more generic, or put logic in the template to check whether they're new or reconfirming.\n\nThoughts?\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
