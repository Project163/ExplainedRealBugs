Most of this comes down to overriding `find_for_authentication` (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/models/authenticatable.rb#L114) to do a JOIN and convert the WHERE clause.\n\nHowever, the Recoverable strategy uses `find_or_initialize_with_errors` which does a a `to_adapter.find_first` call directly (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/models/authenticatable.rb#L135). This also means password reset doesn't get the `case_insensitive_keys` and `strip_whitespace_keys` treatment (seems like they should be in `filter_auth_params` anyhow).\n\nNow we could just override `find_or_initialize_with_errors`, but I'm wondering if there's a better way for consistency. If I'm not fundamentally misunderstanding something, I can put together a patch.\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
