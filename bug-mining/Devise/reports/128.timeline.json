I can trace it down to this commit from 4 years ago:\n\nhttps://github.com/plataformatec/devise/commit/31d70206371cb45b86bea906f3cacceda9449b3e\n\nThe commit even specs out clearly that it should redirect to the sign in path when http_authenticable_on_xhr is false.  I haven't worked on APIs much, so I'm not sure what the goal was here.  The problem in my particular app is that the sign in path that it wants to redirect the failure to simply doesn't exist.  I'm not sure exactly what it means to be a \"navigational format.\"  In this case, there is an assumption that there is a path that you can fetch and it will tell you how to log in.  Is this what it means for it to be

think of the redirection then, as a navigational assist for the user, which suggests to me that devise is assuming that a xhr is a navigational format request regardless of the request format (at least when http_authenticatable_on_xhr is disabled).  Presumably this is so that if the browser is using a xhr to fetching some html partial in on a screen, the user can then sign in (unless we're using basic auth, in which case the browser presumably pops up a password dialog).  Shouldn't that redirect then be mitigated by whether it is a navigational format?  I admit I don't really understand the use case for redirecting a json request when the json format is not specified as navigable.  Am I creating a non-standard api by wanting an xhr json request to just fail with 401 if the user cannot be authenticated?  Assuming this is fairly typical desired behavior, even if the current behavior is desired as the default behavior, should there be some switch to turn prevent that redirect?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/48752461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ashanbrown","id":1858046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTgwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/ashanbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashanbrown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/48755754","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/3112#issuecomment-48755754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3112","id":48755754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzU1NzU0","user":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-11T16:58:36Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T16:58:36Z","body":"The issue is that we cannot return 401 on xhr requests because some browsers will show a prompt asking users for credentials which is now what we want.
