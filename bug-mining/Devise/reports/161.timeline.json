I guess we could possibly set the response to one or the other configured status, depending on what the recall app gives us back. (e.g. if it's a 3xx we use the configured `redirect_status`, otherwise `error_status`.)\r\n\r\nIs the `Devise::Multifactor` goal only to call that redirect? (i.e. it's a separate custom app to do it?) Is there more custom code to it, like do you need a flash message or something to show up? Because if not, I wonder if you could use the [`redirect!` code from Warden directly](https://github.com/wardencommunity/warden/blob/88d2f59adf5d650238c1e93072635196aea432dc/lib/warden/strategies/base.rb#L150-L170). I have never used it myself, but in theory if you call it and then `throw :warden`, it should work if all you need is a redirect from within the custom strategy.\r\n\r\n> If the response code is a redirect, don't overwrite the status or use Devise.responder.redirect_status.\r\n\r\nYeah this is inline with what I mentioned above, I could see a change like this happening possibly.\r\n\r\n> it seems to me that a redirect status from the recall app should never be overwritten with a client error status.\r\n\r\nIt needs to, in order to be fully compatible with Turbo (ensuring a compatible response, I mean). I tried explaining a little bit about the reasoning in that other issue: https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5561#issuecomment-1436891271, but the overall idea of recalling was to simulate re-rendering the form with the authentication failure, thus responding with an error status like any other Rails controller would do.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/1469877086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"carlosantoniodasilva","id":26328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/1475832275","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5570#issuecomment-1475832275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/5570","id":1475832275,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS2Is5X92nT","user":{"login":"devdicated","id":6094548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTQ1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6094548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated","html_url":"https://github.com/devdicated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdicated/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-20T08:46:37Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T08:46:37Z","body":"We use `fail! :multifactor_required` to trigger a flash message with the redirect.

I see, yeah I'm not sure off the top of my head how to make flash + warden redirect work, there's probably some incantation, I'll give it some thought, but what you explained makes sense. \r\n\r\n> I could set up a PR which uses either redirect_status or error_status depending on the recall status if you think that's the way to go.\r\n\r\nSorry I missed your message previously, I was working on making that change here: https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/pull/5573. Hopefully that's all we need to have redirects when recalling the app / action working, making this less of a \"breaking\" change. Let me know what you think. (or if you have an opportunity to test it)
