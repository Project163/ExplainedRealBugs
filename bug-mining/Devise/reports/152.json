If that user arrived with an expired session, I get hit with https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/v4.4.1/lib/devise/hooks/timeoutable.rb#L28. After some time, I found that Devise's own session controller works around this problem and disables timeoutable in order to do its work: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/v4.4.1/app/controllers/devise/sessions_controller.rb#L7\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI think ideally, Devise would take care of not executing the timeoutable hook when calling sign_in because when you're signing a user in, it doesn't make sense to check to see if his old session has timed out.\r\n\r\nIf the current behavior is the desired behavior, I believe we at least need a note in the documentation for sign_in with a disclaimer about how this requires disabling timeoutable using the approach found in Devise's session_controller.","closed_by":{"login":"tegon","id":3727827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjc4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3727827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon","html_url":"https://github.com/tegon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
