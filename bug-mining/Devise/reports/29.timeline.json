So, if everyone agrees, +1 for making it the default and we do not even need a configuration option. across_browser should also be the default. For example, gmail works this way and I would consider it an application that should have strong security concerns.\n\nAbou tests, I recommend you to run just `rake test` for this while, since Datamapper tests are not green (yet).

There are a few changes I would like to propose though:\n\n1) I would like to discuss a better name than remember_for_extendable. I think the current name is not very clear in intent. Something like extend_remember_on_access or extend_remember_period sounds better;\n\n2) remember_me_across_browsers should be on by default :)\n\n3) I believe that in your current patch, the feature you added does not work. We would need to add some integration tests. You are relying on the remember_me! call, but that only happens when the user signs in through password authentication (notice Devise::Hooks::Rememberable is only added to Devise::Strategies::Authenticatable).\n\nhttp://github.com/trevorturk/devise/blob/07a1b0e3f4bf4fe9d6fe0a9dd48ebf94ffde5b58/lib/devise/hooks/rememberable.rb\n\nSince the Rememberable strategy does not inherit from Authenticatable (http://github.com/trevorturk/devise/blob/07a1b0e3f4bf4fe9d6fe0a9dd48ebf94ffde5b58/lib/devise/strategies/rememberable.rb#L9), whenever signing in through the remember me token, it's never renewed.\n\nMy suggestion is: include the rememberable hook in the rememberable strategy and overwrite the remember_me? implementation to only be called if the user has remember_me_extendable set to true.\n\nGreat work!\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/287272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/287294","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/340#issuecomment-287294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/340","id":287294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzI5NA==","user":{"login":"trevorturk","id":402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk","html_url":"https://github.com/trevorturk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-06-24T21:41:27Z","updated_at":"2010-06-24T21:41:27Z","body":"OK - thanks for the pointers, and I'm sorry I didn't get it right the first time :) I'll give it another go like you said and report back here when I have something to show.

I was thinking that the remember me extension might be fine to run just if a user is remembered (as opposed to signing in on a different browser). \n\nFeedback is welcome, but I'll just give it another shot when it's not so late at night in any case :)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/293125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trevorturk","id":402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk","html_url":"https://github.com/trevorturk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/293461","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/340#issuecomment-293461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/340","id":293461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-06-30T10:50:25Z","updated_at":"2010-06-30T10:50:25Z","body":"Hey Trevor, I merged the remember me across browser.

Maybe another test to ensure the method is not called if the user is not remembered would also be good, but I didn't get to that. \n\nSo, my first test isn't working the way I thought it would.

The merge commit in the branch is so that I had a green test suite from your master branch. \n\nAnyway - I think this might be good enough to pull now. Please let me know what you think.

Maybe something like:\n\n\"When true, extends the user's remember period when they are remembered via cookie.\"\n\nAnyway, I'm happy to work up a patch if that's easier for you - just let me know.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/324161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trevorturk","id":402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk","html_url":"https://github.com/trevorturk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/324167","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/340#issuecomment-324167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/340","id":324167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDE2Nw==","user":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-07-23T15:45:55Z","updated_at":"2010-07-23T15:45:55Z","body":"A patch for docs would be welcome!
