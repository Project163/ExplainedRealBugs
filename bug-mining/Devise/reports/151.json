Please add the following to your Devise initializer: (RuntimeError)\r\n\r\n  config.secret_key = 'ABC...'\r\n\r\nPlease ensure you restarted your application after installing Devise or setting the key.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI didn't expect to change devise configuration for the patch level release. I'm using `gem \"devise\", \"~> 4.4.1\"` in `gems.rb`.\r\n\r\nSetting this back to `gem \"devise\", \"4.4.1\"` fixes the issue for the moment.\r\n\r\nI have the `Rails.application.config.secret_key_base` set in an initializer.\r\n\r\nSome info [from the docs](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/generators/templates/devise.rb#L9):\r\n\r\n> Devise will use the `secret_key_base` as its `secret_key`\r\n> by default. You can change it below and use your own secret key.\r\n> config.secret_key = '<%= SecureRandom.hex(64) %>'\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information about my setup, thanks!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tegon","id":3727827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjc4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3727827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon","html_url":"https://github.com/tegon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4807/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
