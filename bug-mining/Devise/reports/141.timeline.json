I thought `Devise::Strategies::Rememberable#extend_remember_me_period` had something to do with it since it always gets called and looking at some historic commits 2e43944567deb0b376e764e2362613e886c3e4f7 7029a5aaa88fcee9a9bf25a63d0105ad97728d08 I presumed it's purpose is to update `remember_created_at` on the resource? But it seems it doesn't do that anymore.\n\n> because that commit is not supposed to extend the remember me period\n\nc92996646aba2d25b2c3e235fe0c4f1a84b70d24, changes the `serialize_into_cookie` to always return `Time.now` as the `generated_at`. Which looking at the check in `Devise::Models::Rememberable#remember_me?`:\n\n``` ruby\n        # The token is only valid if:\n        # 1. we have a date\n        # 2. the current time does not pass the expiry period\n        # 3. the record has a remember_created_at date\n        # 4. the token date is bigger than the remember_created_at\n        # 5. the token matches\n        generated_at.is_a?(Time) &&\n         (self.class.remember_for.ago < generated_at) &&\n         (generated_at > (remember_created_at || Time.now).utc) &&\n         Devise.secure_compare(rememberable_value, token)\n```\n\nEffectively extends the remember_me token, right? The generated only needs to be bigger then`remember_created_at`, not `generated at < (remember_created_at.utc + self.class.remember_for)`\n\nBtw I also ran into an issue with this comparison in `Devise::Models::Rememberable#remember_me?`:\n`(generated_at > (remember_created_at || Time.now).utc)` it relies on the fact that you constantly return an updated `generated_at` in the token, if we're not updating those values all the time per monkey patch for #3950. It's starting to randomly fail due to some serialization issues (probably some precision is lost). I 'fixed' that by changing it to `(generated_at.utc.to_i >= remember_created_at.utc.to_i) &&`\n\nCurrent monkey patch:\n\n``` ruby\nmodule Devise\n  module Models\n    module Rememberable\n      # TODO: Keep track of this issue and remove monkey patch when resolved\n      # https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/issues/3950\n\n      def remember_me!(*)\n        return unless remember_token.blank?\n\n        self.remember_token = self.class.remember_token\n        self.remember_created_at = Time.now.utc\n        save(validate: false) if self.changed?\n      end\n\n      def remember_me?(token, generated_at)\n        # TODO: Normalize the JSON type coercion along with the Timeoutable hook\n        # in a single place https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/ffe9d6d406e79108cf32a2c6a1d0b3828849c40b/lib/devise/hooks/timeoutable.rb#L14-L18\n        if generated_at.is_a?(String)\n          generated_at = time_from_json(generated_at)\n        end\n\n        # The token is only valid if:\n        # 1. we have a date\n        # 2. the current time does not pass the expiry period\n        # 3. the record has a remember_created_at date\n        # 4. the token date is bigger than the remember_created_at\n        # 5. the token matches\n        generated_at.is_a?(Time) &&\n         (self.class.remember_for.ago < generated_at) &&\n         (generated_at.utc.to_i >= remember_created_at.utc.to_i) &&\n         Devise.secure_compare(rememberable_value, token)\n      end\n\n      # Make sure it returns the original generated_at timestamp of the token\n      module ClassMethods\n        # Create the cookie key using the record id and remember_token\n        def serialize_into_cookie(record)\n          [record.to_key, record.rememberable_value, record.remember_created_at.utc.to_f.to_s]\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/197330702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jjoos","id":1165788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos","html_url":"https://github.com/jjoos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjoos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/197359218","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/3994#issuecomment-197359218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3994","id":197359218,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzM1OTIxOA==","user":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-16T14:39:57Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T14:39:57Z","body":"Oh, you are right.
