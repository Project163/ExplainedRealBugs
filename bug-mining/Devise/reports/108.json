Currently, there's no way to remove this restriction entirely like there is for `confirm_within`. I can work around this by setting `allow_unconfirmed_access_for` to some ridiculous value like 1000.years, but that feels like a rather dirty solution. I'd prefer to just set it to nil and have that remove the restriction, but currently doing that yields the following error:\n\n```\nundefined method `ago' for nil:NilClass\ndevise (2.2.2) lib/devise/models/confirmable.rb:162:in `confirmation_period_valid?'\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"nashby","id":200500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby","html_url":"https://github.com/nashby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/2275/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/2275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
