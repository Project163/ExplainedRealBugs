submitted a PR (#3570).\n\n---\n\nAlso I have a bit of a problem with compatiblity with [NoBrainer](http://nobrainer.io/) and the adapter [devise-nobrainer](https://github.com/nviennot/devise-nobrainer/tree/master/lib)\n\nThe AR equivalent in NoBrainer of `save` is `save?` (and `save!` is `save`).\nEverywhere `save(validate: false)` is used, it doesn't matter. But when validations are performed it matters as NoBrainer raises an exception while devise expect no exception.\n\nThere are two places `save` is called and performs validations:\n- https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/app/controllers/devise/registrations_controller.rb#L17\n- https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/models/confirmable.rb#L75-L77\n\nSide node: there are 13 places where save is called without performing validations (that seems a bit odd, but whatever).\n\nSo to make NoBrainer compatible with devise, I make these two `save` calls to call NoBrainer's `save?`.\nA few solutions:\n\n1) Since it's only two call to change, it's simple enough to do a `defined(:save?) ? save? : save`.\n2) We could modify orm_adapter to provide a layer of indirection for `save`\n3) But the orm_adapter project doesn't seem to be much maintained. Further, orm_adapter is not really used by any other project besides devise. Popular libraries seem to provide in-library adapters, which is easier to maintain. (e.g. https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari/tree/master/lib/kaminari/models). So we could remove the dependency on orm_adapter, and roll in-library adapters.\n\nWhat do you think we should do?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/94282758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nviennot","id":297060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/297060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot","html_url":"https://github.com/nviennot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":284725569,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4NDcyNTU2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/284725569","actor":{"login":"nviennot","id":297060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/297060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot","html_url":"https://github.com/nviennot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7b1522d54ab7ba7465c4f6658d0a006537690e34","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nviennot/devise/commits/7b1522d54ab7ba7465c4f6658d0a006537690e34","created_at":"2015-04-19T15:12:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":284732033,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4NDczMjAzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/284732033","actor":{"login":"nviennot","id":297060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/297060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot","html_url":"https://github.com/nviennot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nviennot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c22e7133b68a2e89d009adc8a780455f2bc6e61f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nviennot/devise/commits/c22e7133b68a2e89d009adc8a780455f2bc6e61f","created_at":"2015-04-19T15:48:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":285960804,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjg1OTYwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/285960804","actor":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event"
