In that case I will catch an exception with \"ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)\" when I try to use registration_path anywhere in the controller. That's because path's where generated in the UrlHelpers devise module (and only on controller scope). \n\nIt will be nice, if generation of the device's resource paths can depend on :skip options from the devise_for method (from the routing).\n\nhttps://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/controllers/url_helpers.rb\n\nIf you have any suggestions, how I can get around it, let me know please.\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
