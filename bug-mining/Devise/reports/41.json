This has occurred on two separate projects. \n\nProblem can be remedied by either:\n- setting `config.cached_classes = false` in the appropriate environment file (not desirable in production environments)\n- adding an `:unless =>` to authenticate_resource! call, typically in application_controller.rb:\n      before_filter :authenticate_user! :unless => :devise_controller?\n\nI assume some slight change in rails and class_cache-ing behavior is breaking the redirect / filter functionality.
