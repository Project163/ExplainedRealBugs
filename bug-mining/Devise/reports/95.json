If I use `user_omniauth_authorize_path` inside the views from the engine, it doesn't throw any error like the rest of the devise paths (eg. `new_user_session_path`). Instead, it generates a wrong URL. \n\nIf i use `main_app.user_omniauth_authorize_path` it throws the following error in all views:\n\n```\nundefined method `user_omniauth_authorize_path' for #<ActionDispatch::Routing::RoutesProxy:0x007ffee7d836d0>\n```\n\nI'm using devise-2.0.4, omniauth-facebook-1.3.0 and Rails 3.2.2 on ruby 1.9.3p194, on OS X. I tried to upgrade to devise 2.1.0.rc2 and still have the same issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1843/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
