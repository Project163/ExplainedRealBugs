You can work around by passing\n`skip: :omniauth_callbacks` and manually defining the routes. Here is an example:\n\n    match \"/users/auth/:provider\",\n      constraints: { provider: /google|facebook/ },\n      to: \"devise/omniauth_callbacks#passthru\",\n      as: :omniauth_authorize,\n      via: [:get, :post]\n\n    match \"/users/auth/:action/callback\",\n      constraints: { action: /google|facebook/ },\n      to: \"devise/omniauth_callbacks#:action\",\n      as: :omniauth_callback,\n      via: [:get, :post]\n```\n\nBut solution proposed in error message isn't working for me.\n\nWhat I'm trying:\n\n``` ruby\ndevise_scope :user do\n  providers_regexp = Regexp.new(User.omniauth_providers.join('|'))\n  match '/users/auth/:provider',\n        constraints: { provider: providers_regexp },\n        to: 'users/omniauth_callbacks#passthru',\n        as: :user_omniauth_authorize,\n        via: [:get, :post]\n\n  match '/users/auth/:action/callback',\n        constraints: { action: providers_regexp },\n        to: \"users/omniauth_callbacks##{providers_regexp}\",\n        as: :user_omniauth_callback,\n        via: [:get, :post]\nend\n\nscope '/:locale', locale: Regexp.new(I18n.available_locales.join('|')) do\n  devise_for :users, skip: :omniauth_callbacks\nend\n```\n\nI'm getting next error when trying to authenticate using any provider:\n\n```\nNot found. Authentication passthru.\n```\n\nWhat IS working for me is the @rafaltrojanowski solution (thanks!) from discussion in #2227\n\n``` ruby\ndevise_for :users, only: :omniauth_callbacks, controllers: {omniauth_callbacks: 'users/omniauth_callbacks'}\n\nscope '/:locale', locale: Regexp.new(I18n.available_locales.join('|')) do\n  devise_for :users, skip: :omniauth_callbacks\nend\n```\n\nI think that error message should be changed including some working solution.\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3651/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3651/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
