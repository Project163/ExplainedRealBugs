By default remember_for_extendable is false.\n\nThis new option might also be broken into 2 separate options instead.\n\nIn that case, one option might be remember_me_across_browsers (don't generate a new token if the existing token has not expired) and the other might be remember_me_extendable (allow token expiration to be extended if the user keeps logging in before their token expires). \n\nI made this into one option because it's something I think is generally applicable to applications where very strict security isn't needed, and because reusing the existing token between browsers without extending the expiration may lead to shorter \"remember me\" times for the secondary browsers.\n\nComments, feedback, etc all more than welcome. Thanks!\n\nhttp://github.com/trevorturk/devise/commit/07a1b0e3f4bf4fe9d6fe0a9dd48ebf94ffde5b58\n\n---\n\nAs a separate, but related issue (maybe worth a new Github issue) is that I'm having trouble running the test suite successfully even without my changes. I'm running:\n\nbundle install && bundle exec rake\n\nIs that right? Maybe the readme or wiki could be updated with some contributor testing guidelines...? I know things are in flux right now with Rails 3 and Devise, so my apologies for the trouble and I understand if this needs to be put on hold for now. \n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
