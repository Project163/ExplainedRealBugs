I wrote a devise unit test to reproduce.\n\n``` ruby\ntest \"does not redirect with valid user after failed first attempt\" do\n    get :index\n    assert_response :redirect\n\n    user = create_user\n    user.confirm!\n\n    sign_in user\n    get :index\n    assert_response :success\n  end \n```\n\nI added that to the test/test_helpers_test.rb.  It fails on 2.1.2 but passes on 2.1.0.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/6617243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ejfinneran","id":71407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran","html_url":"https://github.com/ejfinneran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":18785564,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4Nzg1NTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/18785564","actor":{"login":"ejfinneran","id":71407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran","html_url":"https://github.com/ejfinneran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejfinneran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-06-27T22:24:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18827484,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4ODI3NDg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/18827484","actor":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cbc6926e3dc1699f8e9274ce180f4018fb7afdf6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/commits/cbc6926e3dc1699f8e9274ce180f4018fb7afdf6","created_at":"2012-06-28T10:05:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/6625994","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/1928#issuecomment-6625994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1928","id":6625994,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjU5OTQ=","user":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","use
