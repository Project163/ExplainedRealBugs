it not be possible to create a separate hash that has the same life cycle as the flash but is specifically for storing Devise specific state?\n\nI guess I would need to look more closely at how this

bit of a code smell.\n\nAnyone who was accessing the flash for display like:\n\n``` ruby\n- flash.each do |key, msg|\n```\n\nis going to get bit by the :timedout key when they upgrade to Devise 2.0,

[railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/18-looping-through-flash) has a popular  code snippet for iterating through the flash hash:\n\n```\n<% flash.each do |key, msg| %>\n  <%= content_tag :div,
