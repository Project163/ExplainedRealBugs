When we built the rails 4 branch, we removed all the attr_accessible compat because Rails 4 doesn't support it without the external gem. I think that since the README says that we support 3.2 with Devise 3.0, we should probably support that. Also, you'll have to check both Rails version (4.0 vs 3.2) as well as presence of the support gems (protected_attributes and strong_parameters). You should be able to check for their presence by checking to see if a const they define is defined.\n\nThoughts
