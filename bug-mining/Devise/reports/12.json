But I have Metal Middleware, which would like to use the env['warden']. So I need to fix Warden's position with this code in my application.rb:\n\n<pre>\nmodule MyApp\n  class Engine < ::Rails::Engine\n    initializer \"fixing Warden's position in the Rack stack\" do |app|\n      app.config.middleware.delete Warden::Manager\n      app.config.middleware.insert_after(ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore, Warden::Manager) do |config|\n        Devise.warden_config = config\n        config.failure_app   = Devise::FailureApp\n        config.default_scope = Devise.default_scope\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n</pre>\n\n\nHere: http://wiki.github.com/hassox/warden/setup it says that the earliest possible position is after the session rack. That's why in Rails 3 I put it right after ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore. It works fine for me now.\n\nSo this is a feature request to make this more flexible :)\n\nThank you for this incredible gem! I am so fond of it.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
