Omniauth.allowed_methods' as routing verbs for the auth path:\r\n\r\n- ### Context\r\n\r\n  Since version 2.0.0, Omniauth no longer recognizes `GET` request\r\n  on the auth path (`/users/auth/<provider>`). `POST` is the only\r\n  verb that is by default recognized in order to mitigate CSRF\r\n  attack. https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/blob/66110da85e3106d9c9b138d384267a9397c75fe7/lib/omniauth/strategy.rb#L205\r\n\r\n  Ultimatelly, when a user try to access `GET /users/auth/facebook`,\r\n  Devise [passthru action](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/6d32d2447cc0f3739d9732246b5a5bde98d9e032/app/controllers/devise/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb#L6) will be called which just return a raw 404 page.\r\n\r\n  ### Problem\r\n\r\n  There is no problem per se and everything work. However the\r\n  advantage of not matching GET request at the router layer allows\r\n  to get that same 404 page stylized for \"free\" (Rails ending up\r\n  rendering the 404 page of the app).\r\n\r\n  I believe it's also more consistent and less surprising for users\r\n  if this passthru action don't get called.\r\n\r\n  ### Drawback\r\n\r\n  An application can no longer override the `passthru` to perform\r\n  the logic it wants (i.e. redirect the user). (Though, worth to mention that the `passthru` action was originally not meant to be used as fallback https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/1843#issuecomment-5648414 , but maybe this has become a hidden feature over the years :D)\r\n\r\n  If this is a dealbreaker, feel free to close this PR :).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/5508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/5508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
