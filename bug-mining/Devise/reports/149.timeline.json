friend and I started a new project on Ruby 2.5.1, Rails 5.2.0, Devise 4.4.3\r\n\r\nWhen I cloned the project, I was unable to run any rails/rake tasks, since Devise was not able to find the key.\r\n\r\nThe intent is that Rails will automatically set `SECRET_KEY_BASE` for you in dev and test: [link to merge](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/30067/files#diff-580e183141be706162224ef696bdb6c7R413)\r\n\r\nI see that [activity](\r\nhttps://github.com/plataformatec/devise/pull/4712) has been made in the past few months around hunting down the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` but it seems that there is still a small bit more to go:\r\n\r\nCurrently Devise's [Secret Key Finder](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/secret_key_finder.rb) is unable to find the autogenerated key. Rails only does \"auto generation\" of the key in `Rails.application.secret_key_base` which is not currently checked.\r\n\r\n@jcoyne mentioned this in https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/issues/4710#issuecomment-347624819 but it seems that the current implementation doesn't take into account `Rails.application.secret_key_base` -- the only autogenerated version in dev/test for Rails 5.2\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[7] pry(main)> Rails.application.credentials.secret_key_base\r\n=> nil\r\n[8] pry(main)> Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base\r\n=> nil\r\n[9] pry(main)> Rails.application.config.secret_key_base\r\n=> nil\r\n[10] pry(main)> Rails.application.secret_key_base\r\n=> \"d56814a3585e59378bbcabc1467d2693\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [Rails.application.secret_key_base - not checked in devise](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/application.rb#L428)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [help message for this error mentions to hardcode a secret key string into the initializer](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/f220b992c338122226f6fd396056d5a1adf28df8/lib/generators/templates/devise.rb#L11), which would affect all environments. For anyone who comes across this issue until this is better handled, a more appropriate option is to use\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  config.secret_key = Rails.application.secret_key_base\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4864/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/387639071","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/4710#issuecomment-387639071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4710","id":387639071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzYzOTA3MQ==","user":{"login":"lothar59","id":516194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/516194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59","html_url":"https://github.com/lothar59","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lothar59/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T06:54:15Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T06:54:15Z","body":"In my case I believe it's the gem devise_auth_token that overrides my config.secret configuration.
