However, within an engine, the method being used to detect the database adapter doesn't work, and an `ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished` exception is raised.\n\nPossible solutions:\n1. Use Devise 3.2.x instead of 3.3.x.\n2. Find a different way of detecting the database adapter that works both in a base application and within an engine.\n3. If an `ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished` exception is raised when generating the migration, just use a `string` column in the migration.\n\nI'm a little more partial towards 3, and can write up a pull request for it.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/54101092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jbhannah","id":179194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah","html_url":"https://github.com/jbhannah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhannah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/54102239","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/3181#issuecomment-54102239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3181","id":54102239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTAyMjM5","user":{"login":"lucasmazza","id":80978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasmazza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-02T01:55:02Z","updated_at":"2014-09-02T01:55:02Z","body":"@jbhannah thanks for the report.
