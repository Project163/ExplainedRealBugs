I don't have an email field, but use mobile number instead for authentication, so email_changed? will be undefined. I see this line in devise.rb: \n\n```\nconfig.authentication_keys = [ :email ]\n```\n\nIt can be a good idea to find out which key is used for authentication and check whether it is changed from there. I would love to send a pull request if anyone can give me a bit guidance on how to do that.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/123154096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bleakwood","id":1043392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDMzOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1043392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood","html_url":"https://github.com/bleakwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleakwood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/123193434","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/3624#issuecomment-123193434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3624","id":123193434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzE5MzQzNA==","user":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-21T07:04:56Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T07:04:56Z","body":"Sorry, I have been busier than usual, can someone add a flag with the relevant `respond_to?(:...)` checks?
