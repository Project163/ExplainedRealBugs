The name of the method implies that it would raise, similarly to the `save` vs `save!` behavior.\n\nHere's some data to backup my claims:\n- GitLab, a rails app made by fairly advanced coders exhibits the mistake: https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/0991d19c0d157025db8e9bf01d216771a4dbfe31/app/controllers/admin/users_controller.rb#L76\n- Lots of small applications contain this mistake: https://github.com/search?l=ruby&o=desc&p=1&q=%22user.confirm%21%22+filename%3Acontroller+NOT+test+NOT+Factory+NOT+colchonet&ref=searchresults&s=indexed&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93\n\nSo I'd say that `confirm!` should use `save!` instead of returning true/false. Or be renamed to just `confirm?`, or `try_confirm`, to make it explicit to the user should check for the return value.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nSide note: I have personal interest to go with the `save!` route, because NoBrainer's `save!` method has the same semantics as other ORMs, unlike `save` which behaves like `save!`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
