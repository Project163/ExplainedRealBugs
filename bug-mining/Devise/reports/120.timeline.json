So in the meantime I did some work on a service generator to standardize our service objects a bit more.\r\n\r\n### Examples:\r\n\r\n**Generate a non-namespaced service without arguments**\r\n\r\n`$ rails generate service DoTheThing`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/services/do_the_thing.rb\r\nclass DoTheThing\r\n  def self.call\r\n    new.call\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def call\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# spec/services/do_the_thing_spec.rb\r\nrequire \"rails_helper\"\r\n\r\nRSpec.describe DoTheThing, type: :service do\r\n  pending \"add some examples to (or delete) #{__FILE__}\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Generate a non-namespaced service with arguments:**\r\n\r\n`$ rails generate service DoTheThing arg1 arg2`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/services/do_the_thing.rb\r\nclass DoTheThing\r\n  def self.call(arg1, arg2)\r\n    new(arg1, arg2).call\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def initialize(arg1, arg2)\r\n    @arg1 = arg1\r\n    @arg2 = arg2\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def call\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated spec is the same as above.\r\n\r\n**Generate a namespaced service with arguments**\r\n\r\n`$ rails generate service things/dothem arg1 arg2`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/services/things/do_them.rb\r\nclass Things::DoThem\r\n  def self.call(arg1, arg2)\r\n    new(arg1, arg2).call\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def initialize(arg1, arg2)\r\n    @arg1 = arg1\r\n    @arg2 = arg2\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def call\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# spec/services/things/do_them_spec.rb\r\nrequire \"rails_helper\"\r\n\r\nRSpec.describe Things::DoThem, type: :service do\r\n  pending \"add some examples to (or delete) #{__FILE__}\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\nTry the different examples above and verify that the generated code matches your expectations.\r\n\r\n## Added tests?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No, and this is why: there's surprisingly little documentation around testing generators with RSpec. The examples I found all use an external gem for this. I'm not sure I want to add this dependency just yet and we are also not testing the other generator. As this is a convenience tool for developers and not production code I think this is ok until I can evaluate testing strategies during the next cooldown.\r\n- [ ] I need help with writing tests\r\n\r\n## Added to documentation?\r\n\r\n- [X] Docs.forem.com\r\n- [ ] README\r\n- [ ] No documentation needed\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/11265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/11265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
