dawg, i heard you like path_prefix so i put a path_prefix in your path_prefix so you could map while you route...\"\njoke aside, i was digging around and i think i'am on something here\n(for my env check my post just above this one)\n\n## so here's the thing:\n\n## the url i'm accessing : /fr/client/users/sign_up\n\nmy devise route:\nscope ':locale', :constraints => { :locale => /(fr)|(en)/ } do\n    namespace :client do\n      devise_for :users\n    end\n\n## end\n\nthe error says \"some exception in is_devise_resource?\"\nso i've started from there: obviously devise_mapping has to return something, but it does not (and allowed controller include? fails too but i'll talk about it a bit later)\n\n## devise_mapping lead me to mapping.find_by_path where i've \"puts'ed\" this\n\n```\ndef self.find_by_path(path)\n  puts \"some path to search in mappings : #{path}\"\n  puts \"split path : #{path.split(\"/\").inspect}\"\n  Devise.mappings.each_value do |mapping|\n    puts \"a mapping #{mapping.inspect}\"\n    puts \"a mapping seg pos #{mapping.segment_position.inspect}\"\n    puts \"a mapping path #{mapping.path.inspect}\"\n    route = path.split(\"/\")[mapping.segment_position]\n    puts \"a route #{route.to_sym.inspect}\"\n    return mapping if route && mapping.path == route.to_sym\n  end\n  nil\nend\n```\n\n---\n\n## the result is:\n\nsome path to search in mappings : /fr/client/users/sign_up\nsplit path : [\"\", \"fr\", \"client\", \"users\", \"sign_up\"]\na mapping #<Devise::Mapping:0x3a9a5f8 bla bla bla bla>\na mapping seg pos 1\na mapping path :users\n\n## a route :fr\n\nsegment_position is bad, it should be \"3\" (\"users\") so it could match a route and return the mapping\nsince segment_position relies on path_prefix which is not set in my case by 'scope' and 'namespace'\n\ni've tried to put : devise_for :users, :path => 'users', :class_name => 'User', :path_prefix => ':locale/client', :controllers => { :sessions => 'client/devise/sessions', :registrations => 'client/devise/registrations' }\n\n## it's better, but routes are still messed up (undefined method `new_user_registration_path' in app/views/client/devise/shared/_links.erb)\n\nas for the allowed_controllers problem, well its kinda the same : i want \"client/devise/session\" and its compared to \"devise/session\"\n\n## but only when i put devise_for in scope/namespace\n\nso what's the problem here ?\nam i doing something wrong with my routes ?\ncaus' the scope/namespace seems to be the right rails3-way-to-go (that's why i put devise_for there in first place)\n\nthanks\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/293184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zomfg","id":239811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTgxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/239811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg","html_url":"https://github.com/zomfg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/293185","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/331#issuecomment-293185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/331","id":293185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzE4NQ==","user":{"login":"zomfg","id":239811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTgxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/239811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg","html_url":"https://github.com/zomfg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zomfg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-06-30T03:38:02Z","updated_at":"2010-06-30T03:38:02Z","body":"oups,
