I need to set up some time to understand how fallbacks work in I18n and how to write tests for Devise before I can work on this. Right now I'm in a rush to finish quite some tasks before the end of the year and I can't work on this out of my work journey because I have to take care of my baby so it's possible that I will only be able to work on this next year. For now I've just overriden `find_message` to fix it in the application and get my work done in the due date but later I'll try to work on a proper fix by sending a pull request to Devise. You may close this ticket in the meanwhile if you prefer.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/66611482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rosenfeld","id":32246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/rosenfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/68435560","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/3367#issuecomment-68435560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3367","id":68435560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NDM1NTYw","user":{"login":"rosenfeld","id":32246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/rosenfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-31T10:57:27Z","updated_at":"2014-12-31T10:57:27Z","body":"@josevalim when I searched for fallbacks in I18n I found an unrelated subject:\n\nhttps://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n/wiki/Fallbacks\n\nI believe you meant something else by fallbacks, like the multiple options passed to the :default key. But if we change the :scope argument it would be backward incompatible and might break someone's translations. Are you sure you want to stop using this scope?\n\nThe changes I suggested is unlikely to break any existing translations. It could, for instance, try to get the translation from `\"devise.#{controller_name}\"` first. Then it could try with `translation_default_scope` as a fallback mechanism.
