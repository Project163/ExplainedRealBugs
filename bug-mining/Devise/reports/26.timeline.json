So, instead of failing sending the whole data, the information they should send should actually be like this:\n\n```\n\"sessions\": {\n  \"key1\": \"somevalue\",\n  \"key2\": \"another value\",\n  \"warden.stuff\": \"COULD NOT SERIALIZE TO JSON\"\n}\n```\n\nBesides, quickly looking at the code, it seems that they are always forcing the session to be loaded and not respecting the loaded? flag:\n\nhttp://github.com/contrast/exceptional/blob/release/lib/exceptional/exception_data.rb#L93\n\nThis means that, all requests are creating a new session. So, if you expose a XML API, sessions are created for API requests. If you have a crawler on your site, sessions are created for each page the crawler access. This is not an issue for cookie store, but if you are using the database store, you are basically creating several ghost sessions.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/296656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/296678","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/356#issuecomment-296678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/356","id":296678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjY3OA==","user":{"login":"dim","id":16614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim","html_url":"https://github.com/dim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-07-02T10:30:46Z","updated_at":"2010-07-02T10:30:46Z","body":"Not all requests are creating a new session, since ExceptionData is only collected when an exception is thrown, but your other points are absolutely valid. \n\nI didn't expect you to \"fix\" the problem, I just wanted to hear your take on it.
