I found that the user was indeed getting locked out. After couple of minutes when I again tried giving false credentials again I found that the failed_attempt column was not being reset to 0 but instead being incremented.\n\nShouldn't the failed_attempt be reset to 0 once the unlock_in period has passed(expired?). Is this a issue or am I missing something?
