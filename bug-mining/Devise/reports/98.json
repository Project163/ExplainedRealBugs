From the current, master's [failure_app.rb](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/3cbced4e4e644d18c8a5a7043d8fefde9829087a/lib/devise/failure_app.rb#L80):\n\n``` ruby\ndef redirect_url\n  if warden_message == :timeout\n    flash[:timedout] = true\n    attempted_path || scope_path\n  else\n    scope_path\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe third line there is causing the Rails `Flash::FlashHash` object instance to carry a flash[:timedout] whose value is of TrueClass.  For generalized flash implementations, such as the [one generated](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/3cbced4e4e644d18c8a5a7043d8fefde9829087a/test/rails_app/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb) and recommended by this gem:\n\n``` erb\n<%- flash.each do |name, msg| -%>\n  <%= content_tag :div, msg, :id => \"flash_#{name}\" %>\n<%- end -%>\n```\n\nThe following HTML is being generated and displayed to visitors:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"flash_timedout\">true</div>\n```\n\nObviously, this is non-ideal. :)  Is this `:timedout` flash message actually used for anything?  I see that the failure_app is [explicitly keeping](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/3cbced4e4e644d18c8a5a7043d8fefde9829087a/lib/devise/failure_app.rb#L57) the :timedout flash message, even though it's simply a `true` statement:\n\n``` ruby\ndef redirect\n  store_location!\n  if flash[:timedout] && flash[:alert]\n    flash.keep(:timedout)\n    flash.keep(:alert)\n  else\n    flash[:alert] = i18n_message\n  end\n  redirect_to redirect_url\nend\n```\n\nBased on a cursory reading of this code, it seems to me that a simple instance variable, which is set to true/false and nilified with each Rack `call` request, would provide the same functionality and work significantly better.\n\nAnd, yes, I did see @josevalim's [comment on the use of Flash](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/commit/275c480f89f814af7135093a507ab57397729faf#commitcomment-925730)... I just wonder if either the README and example application layout should be updated to reflect the check for String-iness or the surprising usage of Flash for non-user messages should be removed.\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1777/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1777/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
