Is there a bug in how Devise sets up Omniauth, that the :debug option had effect but not the :info_fields and :extra_fields when written into omniauth initializer (maybe specific to shibboleth strategy only).\n\nDevise simply forward the given option, so at first it is unexpected to have it working for some, but not all.\n\n> Or maybe this should be highlighted more strongly in the documentation that Devise takes care of all of Omniauth setup and no separate initializer is consulted.\n\nDefinitely this. Could you please provide a pull request updating the docs in the appropriate place?
