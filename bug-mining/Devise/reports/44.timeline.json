seems to be some confusion on how to get remember me working with Omniauth.\n\nAccording to this [wiki](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/Omniauthable,-sign-out-action-and-rememberable), you need to have the following in your OmniauthCallbacksController:\n\n```\nremember_me(user)\n```\n\nOn the other hand, according to this [issue](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/issues/776), you just need to do this:\n\n```\nuser.remember_me = true\n```\n\nIn addition, making remember_me default to true according to [this](http://dev.mensfeld.pl/2013/12/rails-devise-and-remember_me-rememberable-by-default/), you just need to add the following to your User.rb\n\n```\ndef remember_me\n  true\nend\n```\n\nNot sure which one is the official answer, and all three doesn't work for me. It only works for Chrome on Mac, but doesn't for Firefox Mac & Chrome Windows. Not sure what is going on.\n\nMy code looks like this:\n\n```\n# -*- encoding : utf-8 -*-\nclass OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController\n\n    include Devise::Controllers::Rememberable\n\n    def all\n        omniauth = request.env[\"omniauth.auth\"]\n        auth = Authentication.find_by_provider_and_uid(omniauth['provider'], omniauth['uid'])\n        if auth\n\n            auth.update_with_omniauth omniauth\n            auth.save!\n\n            # ???\n            remember_me auth.user\n            auth.user.remember_me = true\n\n            if user_signed_in?\n                redirect_back_or settings_path(current_user)\n            else\n                sign_in_and_redirect auth.user, event: :authentication\n            end\n        else\n            if user_signed_in?\n                current_user.build_auth(omniauth).save!\n                redirect_back_or settings_path(current_user)\n            else\n                session[\"devise.omniauth\"] = omniauth.except('extra')\n                redirect_to new_user_registration_url\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    alias_method :facebook, :all\n    alias_method :twitter, :all\n\nend\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/3150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Sharparam","id":551094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTA5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/551094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam","html_url":"https://github.com/Sharparam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharparam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-18T18:14:13Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T18:14:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RocketFuelLeak/RocketFuelLeakSite/issues/28","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RocketFuelLeak/RocketFuelLeakSite","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RocketFuelLeak/RocketFuelLeakSite/issues/28/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RocketFuelLeak/RocketFuelLeakSite/issues/28/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RocketFuelLeak/RocketFuelLeakSite/issues/28/events","html_url":"https://github.com/RocketFuelLeak/RocketFuelLeakSite/issues/28","id":43162439,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MzE2MjQzOQ==","number":28,"title":"Enable
