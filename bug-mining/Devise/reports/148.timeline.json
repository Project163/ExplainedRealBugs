been a long time I've lost some of the context; I really wish I'd been more descriptive in the original issue.\r\n\r\nBasically, you want to check if a user is signed in without running authentication hooks. I don't remember why running the authentication hooks was a problem, but I believe it was causing exceptions to be raised and redirects to happen when all I wanted to do was provide additional data in a JSON response _if_ a certain user type was present.\r\n\r\nOne thing I left out in this description is [this comment](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/88724e10adaf9ffd1d8dbfbaadda2b9d40de756a/lib/devise/controllers/sign_in_out.rb#L6) which explicitly mentions that it \"Does not run authentication hooks.\" but unfortunately its implementation calls [`warden.authenticate?`](https://github.com/hassox/warden/blob/fa24dcbf34022d85dce8db51dd11bbbe5a6fddcc/lib/warden/proxy.rb#L109-L118) which according to the docs explicitly _does_ run authentication hooks.\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that a lot of people are probably (and accidentally?) relying on the current behavior of running auth hooks that maybe it's too late to change, in which case 1) the docs should probably be fixed and 2) some Devise API should be provided to check if a user is present without running the hooks.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/352950005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"machty","id":81818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty","html_url":"https://github.com/machty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/353647152","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/4599#issuecomment-353647152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4599","id":353647152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzY0NzE1Mg==","user":{"login":"tegon","id":3727827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjc4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3727827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon","html_url":"https://github.com/tegon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-22T17:58:35Z","updated_at":"2017-12-22T17:58:35Z","body":"I see.
