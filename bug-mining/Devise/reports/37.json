However, Devise does not find these views. When I move them to the directory `app/views/actors_account/` then Devise finds these views.\n\nThe problem is that `Devise::Controllers::ScopedViews#render_with_scope` tries first with `devise_mapping.plural`, which returns `:actors_account`. I would expect Devise to try first with `'actors/account'` rather than `:actors_account`, because I would expect to the views to belong in `app/views/actors/account`.\n\nCheers\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/654/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
