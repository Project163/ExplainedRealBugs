first thought it was an error on my part and went to StackOverflow with this problem. But after lots of investigating I'm sure this is a real bug. (Original SO post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67215678/why-are-my-multiple-devise-for-calls-for-omniauth-not-working)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen using `devise_for` with OmniAuth in dynamic route segments, e.g. a localized scope, the officially recommended way is to use two separate calls of `devise_for`.\r\n\r\nIt says so in the Wiki (https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-OmniAuth-inside-localized-scope) and also in the error message if you try it anyway: \r\nhttps://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/5d5636f03ac19e8188d99c044d4b5e90124313af/lib/devise/rails/routes.rb#L424-L433\r\n\r\nThe problem with that solution is that Devise only partially supports calling `devise_for` multiple times for the same resource: \r\n\r\n* Existing routes and path helpers are maintained between calls.\r\n* But each new call overrides the mapping instance from the previous call and thus removes any controller configuration, regardless of the `only` or `skip` option.\r\n\r\nIn other words:\r\n1. The first call sets up *only* the omniauth controller (and the routes and helpers)\r\n2. The second call then completly removes the omniauth controller configuration and sets the controllers for the other modules. (So the omniauth controller config is actually deleted, while the previous routes/helpers are kept.)\r\n\r\nIn case you are wondering why this solution still works for other users (e.g. https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/3651#issue-90422948 or https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/pull/2227#issuecomment-31399288) I believe the reason is in `Devise::Mapping#default_controllers`. There the controllers hash has a default proc which automagically (re-)creates the omniauth controller configuration with the default value. (`devise/omniauth_callbacks`)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/5d5636f03ac19e8188d99c044d4b5e90124313af/lib/devise/mapping.rb#L131-L136\r\n\r\nSo for users relying in the integrated omniauth callback controller the official solution kinda works. Even though the second call removes the controller configuration, the missing configuration is then auto-generated when Devise tries to read it.\r\n\r\nFor users who require a different omniauth controller configuration - as demonstrated in the Wiki article and in the error message - the solution does not work, because the controller settings from the first `devise_for` call are \"clobbered\" by the second call and overridden with the Devise defaults.\r\n\r\nI have no idea on how to really fix this. Fully supporting multiple `devise_for` calls with the same resource and merging mappings seems to be the most comprehensive way, but it looks like this would be non-trivial.\r\nPerhaps returning to the old recommendation (i.e. manually adding two `match` statements in `routes.rb`) is inconvenient but at least it's would actually allow configuration the controller.\r\nAt the least the Wiki should be changed to not suggest the first `devise_for` call can be used to configure the callback controller.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Ruby **3.0.0** (win64)\r\n- Rails **6.1.3**\r\n- Devise **4.7.3\"** (master from Github)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/5375/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/5375/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
