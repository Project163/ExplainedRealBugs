I have an application which has **multiple** rails engines mounted on it. Some of these engines use devise for authentication.\n\nNow, it is easy to setup devise to work with one engine - by setting the **'router_name'** and **'parent_controller'** in _config/initializer/devise.rb_ file. But since, in this case, each DeviseController must inherit from each engine's own Application Controller and defining multiple devise initializer files simply overrides the values.\n\nI think an optimum solution for this is to allow devise the ability to be able to mount to multiple engines. One way i propose for this is to have the devise provides **Mixins** for each controller and we should have a generator class that generates the controllers classes using those mixins and for each engine, which can be easily configured in the initializer file.\n\nAnother solution for this problem is to separate out all authentication to a single engine (and it can be configured to use devise easily), but that would require moving/copying of the layouts and js, css, etc. assets as well to that authentication engine, thus violating the DRY principle.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/2827/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":16,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/2827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/268123758","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/4127#issuecomment-268123758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4127","id":268123758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODEyMzc1OA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T01:00:48Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T01:00:48Z","body":"The same..... .o_0     \r\n-100 rep for devise.. ..","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/268123758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/308959262","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/4127#issuecomment-308959262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4127","id":308959262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODk1OTI2Mg==","user":{"login":"a-barbieri","id":1528468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mjg0Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1528468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri","html_url":"https://github.com/a-barbieri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T07:53:06Z","updated_at":"2017-11-17T10:00:14Z","body":"I encountered the same problem after upgrading from Rails `5.0` to `5.1` and moving from Devise `4.1.1` to `4.3.0`.

debugging this for a couple of hours now I fear the problem actually comes from the PR I made. Before my PR `opts[:script_name]` wasn't even defined thus the call to generate the route (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/failure_app.rb#L151) was actually\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontext.send(route, {})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in a route like `\"http://localhost:3001/myengine/users/sign_in\"` (assuming the `router_name` is set to `my_engine`\r\n\r\nAfter my PR the result is `\"http://localhost:3001/users/sign_in\"`\r\n\r\nThis was obviously not my intention but it fixed the error with infinite loop (mentioned in my PR). \r\n\r\nAt the moment I have no solution for this. First thing is to provide a test within devise we can code against. Everything else is not future proof. \r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/309161871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"basiszwo","id":24071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo","html_url":"https://github.com/basiszwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basiszwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/309197379","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/4127#issuecomment-309197379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4127","id":309197379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTE5NzM3OQ==","user":{"login":"a-barbieri","id":1528468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mjg0Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1528468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri","html_url":"https://github.com/a-barbieri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-barbieri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-17T06:41:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T06:41:03Z","body":"Good.
