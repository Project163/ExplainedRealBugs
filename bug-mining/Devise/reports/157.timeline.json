Description\r\n\r\nWhen running the test suite locally I noticed some Devise deprecation warnings (see screenshot)\r\n\r\nBased on the message it seems we need to change the way we are calling and rendering the devise error messaging from `<%= devise_error_messages! %>` to `<%= render \"devise/shared/error_messages\", resource: resource %>`\r\n\r\nHere is a relevant link on the Devise repo https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5257\r\n\r\n# Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this have the app setup locally and run the full test suite with `rspec`. You will notice the messages output in a couple of spots while running the tests. These messages are also being output when running the [tests in CI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ifmeorg/ifme/875/workflows/7b729fb0-8485-4e7b-821d-3fb5155b3ca0/jobs/12879/parallel-runs/0/steps/0-117) as well \r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-10-01 at 6 54 02 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/413224/94806024-ef5f6300-03b2-11eb-8712-7deaaebb538f.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease assign yourself (via the Assignees dropdown), if you do want to work on this issue.
