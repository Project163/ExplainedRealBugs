Consider a website that has http://example.com and https://secure.example.com as well as another application with https://foobar.example.com. The first one will want to set the rememberable cookie with `:domain => :all`. The second site wants its own rememberable cookie, it doesn't want to get the wrong rememberable cookie from secure.example.com the first time you hit it.\n\nThe same story applies to various developer, test, staging environments under the some domain name. We want to be able to inject Rails.env.to_s into the name of the remember me cookie.\n\nSo far I am doing some monkey patching with backwards compat: https://gist.github.com/4549185, which isn't great.\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/2218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/2218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
