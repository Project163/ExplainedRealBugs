To add more fields,\n# add them below\nconfig.extra_exposed_model_methods_for_i18n = [:first_name, :last_name, :email]\n```\n\nThat means the `set_flash_message` will look more like this:\n\n```\ndef set_flash_message(key, kind, options={})\n  options[:scope] = \"devise.#{controller_name}\"\n  options[:default] = Array(options[:default]).unshift(kind.to_sym)\n  options[:resource_name] = resource_name\n\n  # Add the extra methods to options here\n  Devise.extra_exposed_model_methods_for_i18n.each do |method_name|\n    options[method_name] = resource.send(method_name)\n  end\n\n  message = I18n.t(\"#{resource_name}.#{kind}\", options)\n  flash[key] = message if message.present?\nend\n```\n\nWith this, I should be able to use\n\n```\ndevise:\n  sessions:\n    create: \"%{first_name}, that's totally awesome!\"\n```\n\nWhat do you think? Do you recommend another way?\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
