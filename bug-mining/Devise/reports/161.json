The following code works as expected in 4.8:\r\n\r\n### In the strategy\r\n```\r\nfail! :multifactor_required\r\nthrow :warden, recall: 'Devise::Multifactor#redirect'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### In Devise::MultifactorController\r\n```\r\ndef redirect\r\n  redirect_to multifactor_path(resource_name)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Ruby 3.0\r\n- Rails 7.0\r\n- Devise 4.9.0\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\n\r\nThe 4.9.0 version of the failure app overwrites the response code from the recall with `Devise.responder.error_status`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nself.response = recall_app(warden_options[:recall]).call(request.env).tap { |response|\r\n  response[0] = Rack::Utils.status_code(Devise.responder.error_status)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIf the response code is a redirect, don't overwrite the status or use `Devise.responder.redirect_status`. It could be that I am misunderstanding or misusing the Failure app, but it seems to me that a redirect status from the recall app should never be overwritten with a client error status.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlosantoniodasilva","id":26328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/5570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/5570/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
