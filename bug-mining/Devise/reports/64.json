(Please correct me, as I'm willing to learn!)\n\nWhen trying to log in with an existing email address/account identifier, but the wrong password, for an account that has not yet been confirmed, Devise seems to check for confirmation before the login/password combo. This leads to an error pointing people to confirm their accounts, not an error that the credentials are incorrect.\n\nThis, in the best case, is a bit of a privacy issue; in the worst case, it allows attackers to find out whether or not an email/login name has been used.\n\nI'm going to fork the repo and try to switch this order, but I'm not sure if I'll succeed. So I'm flagging it for everyone's attention.\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
