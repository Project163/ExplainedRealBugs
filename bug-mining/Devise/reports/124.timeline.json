@josevalim– that does solve part of the issue. The reason I wanted to pass in the variable `resource_updated`, is that I'm using the yield block to run another set of updates with an external API. In the case that that update fails, I want to set `resource_updated` to `false` so that it goes to the failed branch of the update action. \n\nThough `resource.errors.empty?` allows me to determine whether the resource was successfully updated in the line just above, I can't change the course of action in the `yield` block (other than manually setting a `redirect_to path and return` command– but this skips out of the other methods you all have written with this controller action).\n\nEssentially, it'd be something like so:\n\n```\nsuper do |resource, resource_updated|\n  if need_to_update_with_external_api\n    resource_updated = resource_updated && update_with_external_api(resource)\n    if resource_updated\n      # run some custom actions here, set a flash message perhaps\n      # enter into the `resource_updated = true` branch when finished with the yield block\n    else\n      # set some other flash message here\n      # enter into the `resource_updated = false` branch when finished with the yield block\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis may be way too specific for you all to worry about, but by simply passing along the `resource_updated` to that block, I think I can use the same behavior without needing to completely customize/overwrite the controller.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/77713888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"krnjn","id":572804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjgwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn","html_url":"https://github.com/krnjn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krnjn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":248059789,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ4MDU5Nzg5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/248059789","actor":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-07T22:25:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":248059790,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0ODA1OTc5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/248059790","actor":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-07T22:25:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/77714215","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/2936#issuecomment-77714215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/2936","id":77714215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzE0MjE1","user":{"login":"dpehrson","id":263184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/263184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson","html_url":"https://github.com/dpehrson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpehrson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-07T22:33:12Z","updated_at":"2015-03-07T22:36:44Z","body":"@krnjn Good use case.\n\n@josevalim I realize this is a much, much larger idea, but for a long time I've wished that devise would decouple all this logic from the controllers and into a service layer so the
