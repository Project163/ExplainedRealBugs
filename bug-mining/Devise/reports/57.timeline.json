This is something of a problem. Looks like that change in SHA1:1dd19c1 didn't cure this, because `:constraints` isn't allowed to contain `:action`.\n\n(Edit: I'm also using Forgery, and have opened https://github.com/sevenwire/forgery/issues/35 as a feeler to see if the maintainer is interested in a re-factor (I started work, but it's really a mess to try and refractor all of that stuff))\n\n@nixme what is forgery monkey patching that breaks this? (code link?)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/1990783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leehambley","id":18952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley","html_url":"https://github.com/leehambley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leehambley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2966116,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk2NjExNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/2966116","actor":{"login":"nixme","id":4344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme","html_url":"https://github.com/nixme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2011-09-04T10:54:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/1991729","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/1280#issuecomment-1991729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1280","id":1991729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTE3Mjk=","user":{"login":"corasaurus-hex","id":130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex","html_url":"https://github.com/corasaurus-hex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corasaurus-hex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-09-04T15:17:26Z","updated_at":"2011-09-04T15:17:26Z","body":"I just released forgery 0.4.0, could you give it a try and see if it fixes the issue for you?
