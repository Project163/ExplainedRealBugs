I now created a brand new demo app with just Rails 3.2.13 and Devise 2.2.4 configured with devise :database_authenticatable, :timeoutable. I'm using just a Person and Product model.\n\nThe same unexpected result pop ups here too. What's the case:\n\nWhen I'm in an edit form (edit controller action) and my time-out expired then I submit the form. The Sign in form arises to request my credentials again and then redirects back to the form I was in. Alas, it should do so, but it doesn't. It redirects back to the show form. On a create action it redirects back to the index action. Here's my log:\n\nStarted PUT \"/products/1\" \nProcessing by ProductsController#update as HTML\n  Parameters: {\"utf8\"=>\"✓\",  \"product\"=>{\"name\"=>\"kabeljouw\"}, \"commit\"=>\"Update Product\", \"id\"=>\"1\"}\n  Person Load (0.3ms)  SELECT `people`.\\* FROM `people` WHERE `people`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1\nCompleted 401 Unauthorized in 1ms\n\nStarted GET \"/products/1\"\nProcessing by ProductsController#show as HTML\n  Parameters: {\"id\"=>\"1\"}\nCompleted 401 Unauthorized in 0ms\n\nStarted GET \"/people/sign_in\"\nProcessing by Devise::SessionsController#new as HTML\n  Rendered .../ruby-1.9.3-p392/gems/devise-2.2.4/app/views/devise/shared/_links.erb (0.8ms)\n  Rendered .../ruby-1.9.3-p392/gems/devise-2.2.4/app/views/devise/sessions/new.html.erb within layouts/application (5.3ms)\nCompleted 200 OK in 40ms (Views: 39.4ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)\n\nIn theory the store_location!() method records the last GET request to redirect back to. That should be the edit action on the controller. But after authentication an extra GET request is generated (/products/1) and thus saved by store_location!(). \n\nWhere does this extra GET request come from? It looks like it ain't the Rails framework. There is no Redirect_to log message. This extra GET request should not be there or should not be recorded by store_location!() in order to get the expected user experience.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nashby","id":200500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby","html_url":"https://github.com/nashby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nashby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/2421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/2421/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
