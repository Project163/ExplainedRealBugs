@stevecrozz, thanks for your report.\r\n\r\nWe could do what you said - assume that an authentication always need to ignore the timeout - but since this is going to change devise's behavior significantly, that would require a major version, and we don't know if there's any code out there relying on the current behavior.\r\nAs far as I understand, you can get around this by setting `env[\"devise.skip_timeout\"] = true` in your strategy, right?\r\nIf so, I guess is the way to go.\r\n\r\nThanks!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/374328079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tegon","id":3727827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjc4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3727827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon","html_url":"https://github.com/tegon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tegon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1529275916,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTUyOTI3NTkxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/1529275916","actor":{"login":"stevecrozz","id":133328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzMyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz","html_url":"https://github.com/stevecrozz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-19T18:59:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1529275918,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1MjkyNzU5MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/events/1529275918","actor":{"login":"stevecrozz","id":133328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzMyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz","html_url":"https://github.com/stevecrozz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-19T18:59:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/374359227","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/4773#issuecomment-374359227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/4773","id":374359227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDM1OTIyNw==","user":{"login":"stevecrozz","id":133328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzMyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz","html_url":"https://github.com/stevecrozz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevecrozz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T20:20:38Z","updated_at":"2018-0
