No matter if there was a timeout, sign-out action should always redirect to after_sign_out_path_for, which is expected by the user. Throwing the sign_in page after a sign_out click is a no-no.\n\nHowever, I see two issues here.\n\n1) there is the potential attack vulnerability for looping, signing out automatically after sign-in. No matter how dull that may be, or how it could be exploited, doubts should be eliminated. Excuse my monkey patch (v1.0.7), it will prevent automatic sign-out:\n\n```\n  def sign_in_and_redirect(resource_or_scope, resource=nil, skip=false)\n    scope      = Devise::Mapping.find_scope!(resource_or_scope)\n    resource ||= resource_or_scope\n    sign_in(scope, resource) unless skip\n    ###\n    sl = nil if (sl = stored_location_for(scope)) == destroy_session_path(scope)\n    redirect_to sl || after_sign_in_path_for(resource)\n    ###\n  end\n```\n\nFeels like this checking for stored_location and determining the right path should be a part of after_sign_in_path_for.\n\n2) Timeoutable works after a request but not knowing know what it was. In case it's a sign-out it will still redirect to the sign-in page:\n\n```\n  if record.timedout?(last_request_at)\n    warden.logout(scope)\n    throw :warden, :scope => scope, :message => :timeout\n  end\n```\n\nAdding here another check if the request is a sign-out might work... Haven't directly worked with warden, got to check out this deeper.\n\nCheers\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/243381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dejanstrbac","id":11549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac","html_url":"https://github.com/dejanstrbac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanstrbac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/273467","html_url":"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/273#issuecomment-273467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/273","id":273467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-06-13T10:41:17Z","updated_at":"2010-06-13T10:41:17Z","body":"Check if the user is already signing out before timing out his connection, closed by 5e1ef9319e498616550972aced364d75997323a2.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/273467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
