I'm having a problem getting Devise to work in conjunction with non-Devise authentication through Warden because it modifies the `SessionSerializer`. See: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/issues/1281\n\nThe current idea is to make the SessionSerializer a configurable option, one that could be set per strategy. Devise would then be able to set its own `SessionSerializer` class for its strategies. I would then be able to use the unmodified `Warden::SessionSerializer` for my separate strategy.\n\nI want to make sure that this sounds reasonable and sane to you, or if you have a better idea on how to resolve this issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wardencommunity/warden/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wardencommunity/warden/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
