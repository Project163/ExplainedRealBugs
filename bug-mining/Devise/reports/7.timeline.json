from 15 years in the future\n\ni experienced a bug where chrome or maybe another extension autofills current password and for some reason \"fills\" thew newpassword and new password confirmation fields with a blank string, equivalent of adding `value=\"\"` to the field using chrome inspector. those values make it all the way to `def update_with_password` which then clears them\n\n```ruby\nif params[:password].blank?\n  params.delete(:password)\n  params.delete(:password_confirmation) if params[:password_confirmation].blank?\nend\n```\n\nand continues the NOOP update.\n\nthe user can accidentally submit a blank form and get a disconcerting success message, and they might be concerned they set their password to a blank string.\n\ni solved it in my app by adding `required` to the html of the form\n\ni'm not sure what a more thorough backend solution would be- i don't know if it's solvable in a generic way in Devise::RegistrationsController#update, because we would have to know that the intent is to update the password - assume that's the case if the two password params are present? and then disallow blank ones... do we do any other validation or just disallow blank ones? should we actually disallow blank ones in `def update_with_password`?\n\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/comments/3082432892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jjb","id":6097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb","html_url":"https://github.com/jjb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
