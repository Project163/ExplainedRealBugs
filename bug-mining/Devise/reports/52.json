This is with using a cookie store for user session data.\n\nBased on some digging, it seems that when they any page they are redirected to the sign_in page.  After that first redirection they are then considering \"signed in\" and are redirected back to their original page.  The problem comes when a user bookmarks the sign_in page for instance and comes directly back their.\n\nI dug through the devise and warden code, and it seems like making the following change solves the problem:\n\n/lib/devise/controllers/internal_helpers.rb: #94\n        if warden.authenticated?(resource_name)\n- to -\n  \n  ```\n  if warden.authenticated?(resource_name) || warden.authenticate?\n  ```\n\nI'm not sure I have enough context to understand if this is the correct fix, but I'd like to get feedback from the devise team about the issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","html_url":"https://github.com/josevalim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/1036/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
