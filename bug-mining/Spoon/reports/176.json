I'm using a `CtScanner` to find declarations that are not referenced, also known as unused code. Nevertheless, if my visitor visits any variable reference referencing `i`, `getDeclaration()` is not able to `i's` declaration. The reason for this error is obvious, [CtLocalVariableReferenceImpl](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/f1baa5b9da2c7657f958ec73446db5412801e0d2/src/main/java/spoon/support/reflect/reference/CtLocalVariableReferenceImpl.java#L46) traverses all parent blocks one after another and [checks](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/f1baa5b9da2c7657f958ec73446db5412801e0d2/src/main/java/spoon/support/reflect/reference/CtLocalVariableReferenceImpl.java#L51) whether a statement of the current examined block is a CtLocalVariable and, if true, whether the variable is the one we are looking for. In case of a CtForLoop (let's call it `loop`), this code is missing `loop`'s declarations (`i` in our example). One solution to fix this error is to check whether a statement is a for loop (or any other statements allowing to declare variables in a new scope-lambdas maybe). However, you may have a better idea that is less brittle.\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/868/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
