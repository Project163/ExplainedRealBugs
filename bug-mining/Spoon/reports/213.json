However, after the sniper printer prints the code, I get: `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Registering symbol: 'c' twice in the same scope`. This happens because the printed code is:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        int a, c = 0;\r\n\r\n\tint c = 0;\r\n\r\n\tvoid foo(int a);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee, everything is fine with my transformation, but the variable `c` is printed twice. I created a failing test case to expose this issue, I hope it helps for fixing the bug:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\n\tpublic void testPrintOneLineMultipleVariableDeclaration() {\r\n\t\ttestSniper(OneLineMultipleVariableDeclaration.class.getName(), type -> {\r\n\t\t\tCtMethod<?> m = type.getMethodsByName(\"foo\").get(0);\r\n\t\t\tm.setBody(null);\r\n\t\t}, (type, printed) -> {\r\n\t\t\tassertIsPrintedWithExpectedChanges(type, printed, \"\\\\Qvoid foo(int a) {\\n\\t\\ta = a;\\n\\t}\", \"void foo(int a);\");\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nThis is the content of the `OneLineMultipleVariableDeclaration` class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage spoon.test.prettyprinter.testclasses;\r\n\r\npublic class OneLineMultipleVariableDeclaration {\r\n\r\n\tint a, c = 0;\r\n\r\n\tvoid foo(int a) {\r\n\t\ta = a;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"nharrand","id":10744853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ0ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10744853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand","html_url":"https://github.com/nharrand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nharrand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
