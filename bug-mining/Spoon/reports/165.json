The caller of a static field is removed during Spooning a class. Under Spoon 5.2.0. \n\nGiven two input classes A and B as follows, even process with an empty processor, the spooned files will remove the caller. \n\n```\n// Input class A\npackage temp;\npublic class A {\n        public static int myField = 3;\n}\n```\n\n```\n// Input class B\npackage temp.b;\nimport temp.A;\npublic class B {\n        static {\n        A.myField = 5;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe output is as follows. The caller of `myField` is removed. I guess A.myField is treated as this.myField. \n\n```\n// Output class A\npackage temp.b;\npublic class B {\n    static {\n        myField = 5;\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/816/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
