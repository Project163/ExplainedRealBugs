Why did this happen? Is Maven Central running out of space? Why ever delete artifacts that have been exposed to the public?\n\nThis is especially problematic since later versions of spoon (2.4, 3.0) contain some significant issues around annotation processing (see https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/issues/132, https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/issues/60). Spoon 1.5 did not have these issues I think because, well, all our stuff used to work and now it doesn't.\n\nI wonder if it might be possible to redeploy spoon 1.5 to maven central? It'd be much appreciated.\n\n(Spoon is amazing btw. Please don't take this issue as a complaint, we'd like to upgrade at some point but not until the annotation issues have been resolved.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"swolf91","id":1949169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDkxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1949169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91","html_url":"https://github.com/swolf91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-22T07:47:13Z","updated_at":"2015-01-22T07:47:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/137","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/137/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/137/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/137/events","html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/issues/137","id":54553626,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NDU1MzYyNg==","number":137,"title":"Bug in annotation value access","user":{"login":"petitpre","id":772133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjEzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre","html_url":"https://github.com/petitpre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petitpre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-16T09:05:00Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T13:27:45Z","closed_at":"2015-02-02T13:27:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":14176513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE3NjUxMw==","name":"spoon","full_name":"INRIA/spoon","private":false,"owner":{"login":"INRIA","id":2951919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5NTE5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2951919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA","html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon","description":"Spoon is a metaprogramming library to analyze and transform Java source code. :spoon: is made with :heart:, :beers: and :sparkles:.
