In this case:\n\n```\nclass Super {\n  int x;\n}\nclass Sub extends Super {\n  void foo() {\n    System.out.println(x);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt creates `FieldBinding` for x with declaringClass as `Sub`, not `Super`. This is translated to Spoon, as `CtFieldReference` to `x` has `declaringType` set to `Sub`.\n\nThis might lead to different problems, for me, for example, getting declaration didn't work, here how I fixed that:\n\n```\ndiff --git a/src/main/java/spoon/support/reflect/reference/CtFieldReferenceImpl.java b/src/main/java/spoon/support/reflect/reference/CtFieldReferenceImpl.java\nindex 074e075..58abe0c 100644\n--- a/src/main/java/spoon/support/reflect/reference/CtFieldReferenceImpl.java\n+++ b/src/main/java/spoon/support/reflect/reference/CtFieldReferenceImpl.java\n@@ -128,11 +128,19 @@ public class CtFieldReferenceImpl<T> extends CtVariableReferenceImpl<T>\n        @Override\n        @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n        public CtField<T> getDeclaration() {\n-               CtType<?> type = (CtType<?>) declaringType.getDeclaration();\n-               if ((declaringType != null) && (type != null)) {\n-                       return (CtField<T>) type.getField(getSimpleName());\n+               CtTypeReference<?> declaringType = this.declaringType;\n+               while(true) {\n+                       if (declaringType == null)\n+                               return null;\n+                       CtType<?> type = (CtType<?>) declaringType.getDeclaration();\n+                       if (type == null)\n+                               return null;\n+\n+                       CtField<T> field = (CtField<T>) type.getField(getSimpleName());\n+                       if (field != null)\n+                               return field;\n+                       declaringType = declaringType.getSuperclass();\n                }\n-               return null;\n        }\n\n        public CtTypeReference<?> getDeclaringType() {\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
