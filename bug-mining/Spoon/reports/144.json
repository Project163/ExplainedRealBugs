That is,  `findImport(chars, false, false);` is skipped if `chars.length == 0` .\n","closed_by":{"login":"GerardPaligot","id":1913901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot","html_url":"https://github.com/GerardPaligot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
