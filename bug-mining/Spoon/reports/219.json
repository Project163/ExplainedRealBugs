I ran into this bug with the following input:\r\n```java\r\npackage nested_generic_class;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.function.Consumer;\r\n\r\npublic class Foo implements Consumer<Foo.Bar> {\r\n    enum Bar {\r\n        A, B;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void accept(Bar bar) {\r\n        System.out.println(bar.name());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProcessing with Spoon:\r\n```java\r\n        Launcher launcher = new Launcher();\r\n        launcher.addInputResource(new VirtualFile(code));\r\n        launcher.getEnvironment().setComplianceLevel(16);\r\n        launcher.getEnvironment().setNoClasspath(true);\r\n        launcher.getEnvironment().setAutoImports(true);\r\n        launcher.getEnvironment().setPreserveLineNumbers(true);\r\n        \r\n        launcher.prettyprint();\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```java\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"String.substring(int)\" because \"resourceParentPath\" is null\r\n\tat spoon.Launcher.prettyprint(Launcher.java:816)\r\n\tat spoon_issues.Main.main(Main.java:27)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that you can also open a pull request reproducing the issue and reference that, instead of writing additional information here.\r\n\r\n**Operating system, JDK and Spoon version used**\r\n\r\n* OS: MacOS 12.0.1 (Monterey)\r\n* JDK: 17 - OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 21.3.0 (build 17.0.1+12-jvmci-21.3-b05)\r\n* Spoon version: current Github\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MartinWitt","id":25300639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAwNjM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25300639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinWitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinWitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/4302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/4302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
