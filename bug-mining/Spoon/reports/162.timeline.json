not entirely sure if this really is a JDT related issue. I found that the parameter `closedAt == null ? null : Date.from(issue.getClosedAt().toInstant())` is a `PolyTypeBinding` (as we can see in your screenshot) holding a `ConditionalExpression`. This `PolyTypeBinding` gets processed by `JDTTreeBuilder` in [line 930](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/f57cd71363273703a8b31364fb206eb50df75f4e/src/main/java/spoon/support/compiler/jdt/JDTTreeBuilder.java#L930) by utilizing a `ReferenceBuilder` to retrieve its type reference (`parameters.add(references.getTypeReference(b));`). `getTypeReference` itself creates a `CtTypeReference` (actually a `CtReferenceImpl`) with simple name [`binding.readableName()`](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/76b364813dc954edee1eb75c2d712a833731bcc1/src/main/java/spoon/support/compiler/jdt/ReferenceBuilder.java#L682) which, in turn, returns the String `closedAt == null ? null : Date.from(issue.getClosedAt().toInstant())`. The exception is finally thrown by `setSimpleName` since `closedAt == null ? null : Date.from(issue.getClosedAt().toInstant())` contains a \"?\".\n\nSo, I think the issue results from `binding.readableName()` returning a String containing a \"?\". Although this function is part of JDT, the returned String makes perfectly sense since the readable name of a `ConditionalExpression` actually contains a \"?\". I'm not sure how to fix the issue yet, but I think it should be fixed by Spoon not by JDT. \n\nEDIT: Spoon may have to handle a `PolyTypeBinding` holding a `ConditionalExpression` separately.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/comments/236110454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msteinbeck","id":317428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck","html_url":"https://github.com/msteinbeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/comments/236113970","html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/issues/751#issuecomment-236113970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/751","id":236113970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjExMzk3MA==","user":{"login":"msteinbeck","id":317428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck","html_url":"https://github.com/msteinbeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-29T07:31:28Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T07:31:28Z","body":">
