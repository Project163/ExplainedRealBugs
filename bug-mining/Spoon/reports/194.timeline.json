The issue #1159 is caused by wrong return type of CtExecutableReference created for lambda. Therefore this code failed too:\r\n```java\r\nassertTrue(lambdaRef.getDeclaringExecutable().getType()\r\n     .equals(paramRef.getDeclaringExecutable().getType()));\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNow there is a question whether solution of this PR is correct.\r\n\r\nIn current spoon model the interface `CtLambda` represents both:\r\n* `CtExpression`, which returns an instance, which implements a type defined by result of `CtLambda.getType()`\r\n* `CtExecutable`, which represents an executable element. It means it has parameters, body, thrownTypes ... and **return type** \r\n\r\nThe problem was that **return type** of executable element was not accessible. Therefore during creation of CtExecutableReference of lambda expression, there was used wrong return type of that executable (see change in `ExecutableFactory`).\r\n\r\nNow the  issue #1159 is fixed - the parameter references are equal.\r\n... but I have found another issue #1163, which causes that `CtLambdaImpl#getExecutableType` actually does not work correctly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/1164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/1164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":947247126,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk0NzI0NzEyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/947247126","actor":{"login":"pvojtechovsky","id":23107345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTA3MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23107345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky","html_url":"https://github.com/pvojtechovsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvojtechovsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"25e855cbff2cd5123faabb5d846960a2ce81441a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pvojtechovsky/spoon/commits/25e855cbff2cd5123faabb5d846960a2ce81441a","created_at":"2017-02-02T22:21:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":952045175,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk1MjA0NTE3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/952045175","actor":{"login":"surli","id":1478232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzgyMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1478232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli","html_url":"https://github.com/surli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"825335e09e986700bb15390cccedc1bab898cf29","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/commits/825335e09e986700bb15390cccedc1bab898cf29","created_at":"2017-02-07T13:26:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":952045176,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTUyMDQ1MTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/952045176","actor":{"login":"surli","id":1478232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzgyMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1478232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli","html_url":"https://github.com/surli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"825335e09e986700bb15390cccedc1bab898cf29","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/commits/825335e09e986700bb15390cccedc1bab898cf29","created_at":"2017-02-07T13:26:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tdurieux","id":5577568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Nzc1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5577568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux","html_url":"https://github.com/tdurieux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.git
