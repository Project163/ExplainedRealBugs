I hacked around the problems in a fork here: https://github.com/SpongePowered/spoon/commit/0443dbeb5eaf582dd63a80acbe65a8b91c1ccf74. You can find some more details in the comments, but I want to put the emphasis on:\n\n> One big issue is the new TypeIntersection which is a subtype of Type. Since it represents multiple types, most CtTypeReference methods, which expect a single type, can't properly be implemented by CtTypeIntersectionReference.\n\nWe also had to fix the source code generator. It isn't related to Java 8, but you can find the commit here: https://github.com/SpongePowered/spoon/commit/ae40d42b1ef451b878282dc70c0e68fd4ab052fb\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
