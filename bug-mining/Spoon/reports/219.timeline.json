In this example, `public class Foo implements Iterable<Foo.Bar<?>>` is changed by Spoon to `public class Foo implements Iterable<Bar<?>>`. Note the missing `Foo.` in the generic argument. While it is sufficient to use `Bar<?>` when *inside* the class declaration of `Foo`, it `Bar`  has to be qualified as `Foo.Bar` when used as the generic parameter to its own super class. \r\n\r\nNote that I use `VirtualFile`in the example code which might fail before #4302 is fixed/#4303 is applied - I actually opened that one  while trying to create this minimal example. ;-) \r\n\r\nI will look into this later and if I find out what's wrong hopefully create a unit test and a patch.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n```java\r\n    package nested_generic_class;\r\n                    \r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.Iterator;\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n                    \r\n    public class Foo implements Iterable<Foo.Bar<?>> {\r\n        private final List<Bar<?>> bars = new ArrayList<>();\r\n\r\n        public static final class Bar<T> {\r\n        }\r\n                    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public Iterator<Foo.Bar<?>> iterator() {\r\n            return bars.iterator();\r\n        }\r\n                    \r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nProcessing with Spoon:\r\n```java\r\n        Launcher launcher = new Launcher();\r\n
