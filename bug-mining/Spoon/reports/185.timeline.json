It assures that `JDTBasedSpoonCompiler.build()` compiles sources and templates only once. Before it was compiled twice, therefore the annotations were duplicated.\r\n\r\nI had to add new `InputType.UNITS` to tell the `createBatchCompiler` method that it should create JDTBatchCompiler which let's us configure to be compiled files.\r\n\r\nI do not like this solution, because public `InputType.UNITS` is there just for internal purposes and it makes no sense for `JDTBasedSpoonCompiler.compile()` ... so it is confusing... But I was not able to found beter way without changing of contract of createBatchCompiler method, which is may be used by clients to filter files and directories.\r\n\r\n@monperrus if you agree that `InputType.UNITS` is wrong, then please refactor `createBatchCompiler` and related tests by some way, so it can be used in simpler way.\r\n\r\nI vote for removing support of filtering by folders and files (test `testFilterResourcesDir` and `testFilterResourcesFile()`)by overwriting of protected method ... this is not good because protect function becomes a \"public
