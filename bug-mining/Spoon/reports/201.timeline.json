I've begun to understand enough of how Spoon works to debug these things now :)\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is that if I have a type access to a type that's not on the classpath (e.g. to access static variable or method), then Spoon does two things wrong:\r\n\r\n1. It assumes that the type belongs to the compilation unit's package. This assumption is invalid if there is any `*` import from a package that's not on the classpath. It was introduced to fix #1293.\r\n2. It makes the reference explicit, causing it to show in pretty-printing.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction, 1 and 2 can cause compile errors as a class that was imported with a `*` import may suddenly be qualified with the wrong package. The place where it all happens is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/e7d42138db21a59beff566af22d72aca4141ddbc/src/main/java/spoon/support/compiler/jdt/ReferenceBuilder.java#L1053-L1064\r\n\r\nThe second point also affects all cases where the JDT does not provide info about something belonging to `java.lang` (see #1307), i.e. that the `java.lang` package statement suddenly becomes explicit. This alone isn't very serious as the code still compiles fine, it's just a bit annoying.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example of where there are issues:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage bug;\r\n\r\nimport some.pkg.*;\r\nimport some.other.pkg.*;\r\n\r\npublic class StaticMemberAccess {\r\n    int someValue = SomeClass.generateValue();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpoon will attach an explicit package reference to `bug` to `SomeClass`, but it could be in any of `bug`, `some.pkg` or `some.other.pkg`, there is no way to tell. So, one needs to check if there is any `*` import from a package that's not resolved before assuming that the compilation unit's package should be used, and I also think that the package should be marked implicit both in the case of the missing `java.lang` thing, and when the package is guessed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what to do when the package cannot be determined however, is it allowed to set the package as `null`?\r\n\r\nI'm working on a PR for this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
