(Which is probably legitimate.)\r\n\r\nThis leads indirectly to position problem and sniper printer problems as documented in  #3321 . Even if this can be worked around ( #3352 ), or may be fixed by changing the start position of the type reference.\r\n\r\nConsider the following case:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n//A type use annotation\r\n@Target({ElementType.TYPE_USE})\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\npublic @interface MyAnno {\r\n}\r\n\r\n//A parameter annotation\r\n@Target({ElementType.PARAMETER})\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\npublic @interface OtherAnno {\r\n}\r\n\r\n//An annotation the can target both parameter and type usage\r\n@Target({ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.TYPE_USE})\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\npublic @interface Ambiguous {\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class AnnoUser {\r\n\tpublic void m1(@MyAnno String p) {} // Annotation is on the type reference to String\r\n\tpublic void m2(@OtherAnno String p) {} // Annotation is on parameter p\r\n\tpublic void m3(@Ambiguous String p) {} // Annotation is on both\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCorresponding bytecode\r\n```\r\n  public void m1(java.lang.String);\r\n    descriptor: (Ljava/lang/String;)V\r\n    flags: ACC_PUBLIC\r\n    Code:\r\n      stack=0, locals=2, args_size=2\r\n         0: return\r\n      LineNumberTable:\r\n        line 4: 0\r\n      LocalVariableTable:\r\n        Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature\r\n            0       1     0

void m3(java.lang.String);\r\n    descriptor: (Ljava/lang/String;)V\r\n    flags: ACC_PUBLIC\r\n    Code:\r\n      stack=0, locals=2, args_size=2\r\n         0: return\r\n      LineNumberTable:\r\n

0: #21()\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo my understanding:\r\n\r\n *  in the case of `m1`, the position of the parameter and its type reference should include the position of the annotation.\r\n *  in the case of `m2`, the position of the parameter should include the position of the annotation, but the position of the type reference should not include it.\r\n *  in the case of `m3`, the position of the parameter and its type reference should include the position of the annotation.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, non of this happen, in all three situation the position of the annotation is exterior to the parameter position.\r\n\r\nSide note, in case 3, as the annotation is cloned, if a transformation is applied to on of the annotation it would not affect the other, hence I am not sure how it would be then pretty printed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3316847454,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzMxNjg0NzQ1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/3316847454","actor":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-08T12:55:01Z","rename":{"from":"SniperJavaPrettyPrinter
