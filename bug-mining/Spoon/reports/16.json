How can be possible? Well, in the `DefaultJavaPrettyPrinter`, we print `this` or `super` according to these conditions:\n\n``` java\nCtType<?> parentType = invocation.getParent(CtType.class);\nif ((parentType != null) \n    && (parentType.getQualifiedName() != null)\n    && parentType.getQualifiedName().equals(invocation.getExecutable().getDeclaringType().getQualifiedName())) {\n  write(\"this\");\n} else {\n  if (invocation.getTarget() != null) {\n    write(invocation.getTarget().getSignature() + '.');\n  }\n  write(\"super\");\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is that `invocation.getExecutable().getDeclaringType().getQualifiedName()` returns a `CtTypeReference` with the older name of the `CtClass`. So, the condition returns false and we print a `super` instruction.\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
