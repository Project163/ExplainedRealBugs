The attached zip archive contains the two directories `data` and `transformators` that, in turn, contain several Java files. I'm using the following code to build a Spoon model:\n\n``` java\nLauncher runLaunch = new Launcher();\nrunLaunch.getEnvironment().setNoClasspath(true);\nrunLaunch.addInputResource(projectPath);\nrunLaunch.buildModel();\nreturn runLaunch.getFactory().Package().getRootPackage();\n```\n\nwith `projectPath` being the path to the unzipped directory, for example, `/home/GerardPaligot/ternary-bug`. Unfortunately, the code listed above results in an exception:\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" spoon.SpoonException: A reference can't have a \"?\" in its name.\n```\n\nYou will find the ? operator in `transformators/IssueTransformator.java` line 86. However, if you delete one of the files contained in `data`, for instance, `data/entities/User.java` the exception is not thrown, though, `transformators/IssueTransformator.java` has not been modified.\n\nI hope this examples helps to understand the issue.\n\n[ternary-bug.zip](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/files/369278/ternary-bug.zip)\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
