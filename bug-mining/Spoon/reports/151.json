There is an example it doesn't and `invocation.getExecutable().getExecutableDeclaration()` returns `null`. \nSteps to reproduce:\nCreate\n\n```\nenum E {\n}\n```\n\nCreate call to `E.values()` and assign `invocation` to `CtInvocation` of it. Now `invocation.getExecutable().getExecutableDeclaration()` returns `null`.\n\nPossible reason is that class `E` is not recognized as subclass of `java.lang.Enum` because `E` is in source path and  `java.lang.Enum` isn't and there are no `extends` declaration on `E`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
