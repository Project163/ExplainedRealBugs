It isn't a good practice but it is valid.\n\nWe can remove this information when we are in a static context but there is a consequence with this modification: we can't reprint \"this\" in `DefaultJavaPrettyPrinter`. For me, this case is the only case where `getTarget()` shouldn't returned `null` but `ThisAccess` and must be specified in the javadoc.\n\n@monperrus your

This was the most easily reproducible one, I'll try to reproduce the other ones later.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my problem is that sometimes when a static field is accessed from a class for which the source is not available, the target of the field read is a `CtThisAccess` instead of a `CtTypeAccess`. This results in some pretty gnarly problems for me. I found this old issue discussing something similar: #346 \r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport spoon.Launcher;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Launcher.logger.error(\"Hello :)\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, I expect the target of the `logger` field read to be a type access to the `Launcher` type. But it's a `CtThisAccess`. So if I just parse this and immediately print it, this is what I get.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport spoon.Launcher;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        logger.error(\"Hello :)\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA this access in a static context doesn't make sense to begin with, and what makes even less sense is that the target of the `CtThisAccess` is the `Launcher` type. So it's a strange cross-type this access in a static context. The problem persists in a non-static methods as well.\r\n\r\nIf I add a `Launcher` class in the same file, as shown below, then it correctly resolves a type access instead of a this access.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Main {\r\n\r\n    private static class Launcher {\r\n        static Logger logger;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Launcher.logger.error(\"Hello :)\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll have a PR with this test case up in a few minutes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
