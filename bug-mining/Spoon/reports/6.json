The first constructor reference the second and the second reference the third.\n\n``` java\npublic class MyClass {\n    public MyClass() {\n        this(\"Default\");\n    }\n\n    public MyClass(String param) {\n        this(param, 0);\n    }\n\n    public MyClass(String param, int paramint) {\n\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the processor, when we retrieve all references of the current constructor, we can't know what is the constructor referenced because arguments aren't available in the interface of references.\n\n``` java\npublic class MyProcessor extends AbstractProcessor<CtExecutable<?>>{\n\n    public void process(CtExecutable<?> element) {\n\n        List<CtReference> refs = Query.getReferences(element, new AbstractReferenceFilter<CtReference>(CtReference.class) {\n            public boolean matches(CtReference reference) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        });\n\n        Set<CtReference> unduplicate = new HashSet<CtReference>(refs);\n\n        for(CtReference aReference : unduplicate){\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
