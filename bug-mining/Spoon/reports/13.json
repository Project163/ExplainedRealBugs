First, the `SuperClass` with an inner class `Item` and a constructor.\n\n``` java\npublic class SuperClass {\n    public static class Item {\n        public Item(int i, String s) {\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe second class, `SubClass` inherits of `SuperClass` and has also an inner class `Item` but with a constructor different and it inherits the inner class of the `SuperClass`.\n\n``` java\npublic class SubClass extends SuperClass {\n    public void aMethod() {\n        new SubClass.Item(\"\");\n    }\n\n    public static class Item extends SuperClass.Item {\n        public Item(String s) {\n            super(1, s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen we spoones these classes, the statement in the body of the method `aMethod` in `SubClass` becomes:\n\n``` java\nnew Item(\"\");\n```\n\nThis statement isn't valid. Java tries to use the class `Item` of `SuperClass` and don't want compile.\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
