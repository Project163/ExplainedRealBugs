discovered a use case where the problem still occurs .\n\nI extended the above example code by implementing an Interface:\n\n``` Java\npackage example;\n\nimport com.google.common.base.Function;\nimport com.google.common.base.Joiner;\n\npublic class Demo implements Function<String, String> {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(Joiner.on(\" \").join(\"Hello\", \"World!\"));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String apply(String input) {\n        return input;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe result of the processor is now:\n\n```\nexample.Demo\njava.io.PrintStream\nFunction\njava.lang.Override\nvoid\njava.lang.System\njava.lang.String\ncom.google.common.base.Joiner\n```\n\nAs you can see `Joiner` has the correct package prefix now, but `Function` has not. I found out this happens whenever I implement an interface, but also when I use a Type as parameter to a method like this:\n\n``` Java\npublic void foo(Function<> f) {\n\n}\n```\n\nNow when I also add a member Variable of that type...\n\n``` Java\npackage example;\n\nimport com.google.common.base.Function;\nimport com.google.common.base.Joiner;\n\npublic class Demo implements Function<String, String> {\n\n    private Function f;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(Joiner.on(\" \").join(\"Hello\", \"World!\"));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String apply(String input) {\n        return input;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nthe corresponding reference will contain the package name, which leads to two different CtTypeReferences:\n\n```\n...\nFunction\ncom.google.common.base.Function\n...\n```\n\nSo, from an outsider's point of view, it looks like Spoon doesn't relate the import statement with type references from `implements` and parameters.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/comments/169731161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"worblehat","id":2873504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzM1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2873504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat","html_url":"https://github.com/worblehat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worblehat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":509286442,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ1MDkyODY0NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/509286442","actor":{"login":"GerardPaligot","id":1913901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot","html_url":"https://github.com/GerardPaligot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-08T10:58:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/comments/169963736","html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/issues/465#issuecomment-169963736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/465","id":169963736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTk2MzczNg==","user":{"login":"GerardPaligot","id":1913901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot","html_url":"https://github.com/GerardPaligot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-08T10:58:34Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T10:58:34Z","body":"Thanks,
