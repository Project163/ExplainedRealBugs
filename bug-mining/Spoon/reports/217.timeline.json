This patch fixes the comparator. \r\n\r\n## Some Math Stuff\r\nA comparator must follow the compareTo contract in java. The compareTo contract defines two formulas:\r\n\r\n(1)  *antisymmetric* sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.compareTo(x))\r\n(2)  *transitive* (x.compareTo(y)>0 && y.compareTo(z)>0) => x.compareTo(z)>0\r\n\r\nAssuming we have 3 points X,Y and Z and all points have invalid positions.\r\n\r\n`compareTo(X,Y)` == -1 ==> X < Y  \r\n`compareTo(Y,Z)` == -1 ==> Y < Z  \r\n`compareTo(X,Z)` == -1 ==> X < Z  \r\nLooks good till here but now:  \r\n`compareTo(Z,X)` == -1 => Z<X\r\nhere we violate the *transitive* requirement. Because Z is now less than X.\r\nIf we do the same after the change:\r\n`compareTo(X,Y)` == 0 ==> X=Y  \r\n`compareTo(Y,Z)` == 0 ==> Y=Z  \r\n`compareTo(X,Z)` == 0 ==> X=Z  \r\n`compareTo(Z,X)` == 0 ==> Z=X  \r\nThe change still follows the antisymmetric contract, because sign(0)=0== -sign(0).\r\n\r\n## Consequences\r\nSome testcases relay on the old sorting, because order was different. Some refactoring for the testcases is needed.  \r\nThere is a risk, that some users have problems with new correct ordering.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-07T06:40:29Z","updated_at":"2020-11-07T06:40:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3678","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3678/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3678/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/3678/events","html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/pull/3678","id":738186023,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTE3MDk2ODUz","number":3678,"title":"fix Jar execution on Java 11","user":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-11-07T06:40:29Z","updated_at":"2020-11-07T20:52:55Z","closed_at":"2020-11-07T09:44:11Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"repository":{"id":14176513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE3NjUxMw==","name":"spoon","full_name":"INRIA/spoon","private":false,"owner":{"login":"INRIA","id":2951919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5NTE5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2951919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA","html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/INRIA/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon","description":"Spoon is a metaprogramming library to analyze and transform Java source code. :spoon: is made with :heart:, :beers: and :sparkles:.
