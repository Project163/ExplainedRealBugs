The goal is to visualize the architecture of those projects and I use Spoon to get the necessary information from the sources.\n\nOSGi applications are divided into \"bundles\" that run in the same JVM but have their own classpath each. So I can't just add all the bundles to Spoon's classpath as this would cause chaos.\n\nI considered writing my own classloader for Spoon to handle this (see mailinglist post [1]) but decided to enable the noclasspath-option and handle resolution of inter-bundle references by myself (after Spoon analysed each bundle on it's own).\n\nThe project I currently analyse has about 180k lines of code so I guess I hit on some corner cases that are not encountered often with Spoon.\n\n[1]
