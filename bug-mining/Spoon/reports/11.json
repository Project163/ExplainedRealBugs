analyze this code : \n\n``` java\npackage todel;\n\npublic class Foo {\n\n    public class Bar {\n\n    }\n\n    public Bar getBar(){\n        return new Bar(){\n            public void

reference: myArg\nDeclaring method reference: .printString\nnew Bar() type ref: \nnew Bar() type declaration: null\nFoo type ref: null\nDeclaration of the Declaring method: null\n null\n```\n\nThe problem is that \"paramRef.getDeclaration()\" return null.\nIt seems that references to methods inside anonymous classes are incorrectly built.\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
