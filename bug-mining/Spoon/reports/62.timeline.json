The twist: The bugs were not actually the big problem. The bugs got fixed rather quickly and PR'ed, but a release containing them took weeks (see #207 and #222), until the next bigger update. This delayed further testing for us to the new release which caused the same situation all over again after the 4.1 release, when we discovered more blocking bugs.\n\nYour release model should allow for bugfix releases in case of critical bugs. I follow quite a few open source projects on Github and they all have different approaches to solve a similar problem.\n\nIn my opinion Git-Flow is more designed for large development teams that manage multiple release and have SLA requirements for customers, so a structured and well-defined release process (which when done correctly can be automated entirely) is quite important. This usually goes hand in hand with tools like Stash (if you don't know it, think of it as a self-hosted github) that help enforce this workflow with features like branch protections and automated branch creation for issues. However for a small team like yours, this is simply overkill.\n\nHere is one approach that I personally like and deploy in a simplified form for internal projects myself:\nThe Netty project maintains multiple stable release in parallel with independent release cycles. They develop on the master branch and cherry-pick applicable commits to the stable branches and publish releases on a regular basis or when critical issues got fixed (which in their context can mean security exploits). In addition to the stable release branches they create feature-branches and create PRs for bigger changes. This is a simple yet effective model that allows to develop new major changes while being able to easily backport bugfixes that also apply to older versions. It also doesn't create much overhead for developers for branching.\nA benefit of this is also that people could create PRs that are targeted to an older version without interfering with the current development and these changes can even be ported forward to the master. \n\nThis model can be reduced to 2 branches:\n- master: the current development towards to next minor (_,X.0) or major (X.0.0) release\n- stable: a branch that contains the code of the latest minor release + additional bug fixes that got backported from master\n\nFeature branches can be used for large features or changes that touch a lot of code in order to keep the master somewhat stable and not conflict with normal development and community PRs.\n\nNo matter what you end up doing, at least do something so people don't have to **wait** weeks **for** a simple **bugfix**, because that **sucks**.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/comments/114076055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pschichtel","id":526104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel","html_url":"https://github.com/pschichtel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":336617371,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM2NjE3Mzcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/336617371","actor":{"login":"swolf91","id":1949169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDkxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1949169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91","html_url":"https://github.com/swolf91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-22T11:45:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":336617372,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNjYxNzM3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/336617372","actor":{"login":"swolf91","id":1949169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDkxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1949169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91","html_url":"https://github.com/swolf91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swolf91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-22T11:45:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/comments/114989841","html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/issues/203#issuecomment-114989841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/203","id":114989841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDk4OTg0MQ==","user":{"login":"pschichtel","id":526104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel","html_url":"https://github.com/pschichtel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-24T19:40:52Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T19:40:52Z","body":"Additional

rrus think about how you're currently doing releases. You're probably just running the maven release plugin on the master once you think it is right to publish a release. That works fine for major/minor releases.\n\nNow imagine the situation where in middle of the next development cycle a horrible bug is found that has to be fixed immediately, but the master has already received many new changes that are not yet tested or are known to be unstable and not production ready.\n\nSo what would you do now?\nWith a the proposed branches you fix the bug, cherry-pick it into stable (or just directly fix it in stable, if it is not applicable to master anymore) and just run the maven release plugin there.\n\nCurrently you would need create a new branch locally based on the release tag created by the release plugin, apply the fixes and run the release plugin (if that even works, as you probably don't want to push this). This 'works', but is not very transparent to the community and is not easily reproducible by peers. Maven is all about reproducible builds, but this situation does not easily allow this.\n\nNow let's make the situation even worse: Another critical bug.\nWith the proposed branches: just do the same procedure again.\n\nWith the current setup: if you're lucky, you still have you local branch with the fix. If not you will have to apply all patches since the last minor release again.\n\nWith this setup its obvious nobody wants to make a bugfix release.\n\nWith specialized branches and a simple jenkins job bugfix releases can be as simple as clicking the merge button in a

For major Releases (Aka when you release the stuff from master), you simply run the release plugin as usual, switch into the stable branch and merge the tagged commit from master into stable.

important part about the minor version (Y): API compatibility. So adding new APIs and changing implementations is fine, but the existing API should stay compatible. You can however deprecate APIs and schedule them for removal.\n\nAbout the process:\n\nAfter thinking a bit more about removing the second commit from the release plugin I wonder if it makes sense. With 2 branches it over-complicates the process. To properly do this you'd need a third branch (e.g. master, stable and released where released would only contain the released code and stable would kind of be a second master for changes to the last stable version).\nI'd say for major/minor releases just run the release plugin inside master and merge master into stable, for bugfix releases just run it inside the stable branch.\n\nIn both processes I see a problem: When you have massive changes in master (imagine a major package refactoring) after a bugfix has been made and released inside stable, you can't easily merge master into stable on the next major/minor release. I think that's why Gitlab for example has a branch for every released minor version (..., 7-1-stable, 7-2-stable, ..., 8-0-stable). That way they don't have to merge master with stable again. The netty project does it similar. They have separate branches for API incompatible releases (3.x, 4.0, 4.1 and master for 5.0).\n\nMaybe an option would be to just override stable with the new master, kind of dropping the bugfix releases in between releases. The history should in theory stay accessible through the tagged commit.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/comments/142391444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pschichtel","id":526104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel","html_url":"https://github.com/pschichtel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschichtel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/comments/142518295","html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/issues/203#issuecomment-142518295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/203","id":142518295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjUxODI5NQ==","user":{"login":"GerardPaligot","id":1913901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot","html_url":"https://github.com/GerardPaligot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-23T07:22:40Z","updated_at":"2015-09-23T07:22:40Z","body":"> Maybe an option would be to just override stable with the new master, kind of dropping the bugfix releases in between releases.
