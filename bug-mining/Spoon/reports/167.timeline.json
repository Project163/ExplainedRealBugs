It took me some time to understand `JDTTreeBuilder` and all its helper classes but I think this is going into right direction, though.\n\nAs you might already have noticed, there are two test cases that fail. The first one is a good example for #813 and can be fixed by using `int sourceEnd = qualifiedNameReference.sourceEnd();`. The second test case fails because [`methodJDT.binding`](https://github.com/retuxx/spoon/commit/634ee11d4e57adaaa8a513d9df57c809ef97a6b4#diff-a490aa7d6a5ea006caa9168294d3d9f4R215) is `null` for anonymous classes`. Since I'm not sure how to create a type reference to an  anonymous class (yet), I was not able to properly handle this case.\n\nFurthermore, [`getVariableDeclaration`](https://github.com/retuxx/spoon/commit/634ee11d4e57adaaa8a513d9df57c809ef97a6b4#diff-05a638c1f9cf369088d14c6b1e4ed0e7R156) is not finished yet as there might be a variable declared in a super class/interface. This case can be handled by iterating through all super classes/interfaces of a `TypeBinding` and checking if the potential variable has been declared in one of them. Unfortunately, I did not managed to create a `TypeDeclaration` from a `TypeBinding` yet. Maybe you have an idea how to do that.\n\nHowever, in it's current state this pr produces much more precise AST in noclasspath mode as a `SingleNameReference` in a lambda expression is not always mapped to a `CtLocalVariableReference`. In addition, `getVariableDeclaration` reduces the amount of cloned code and ensures that a variable is visible in current context.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/814/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":777378014,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc3NzM3ODAxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/777378014","actor":{"login":"msteinbeck","id":317428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck","html_url":"https://github.com/msteinbeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msteinbeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"99a3ba61858e3cc22337c92b50ec6693638fda64","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msteinbeck/spoon/commits/99a3ba61858e3cc22337c92b50ec6693638fda64","created_at":"2016-09-03T15:02:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":782331556,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzgyMzMxNTU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/782331556","actor":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"4322383526db94d07ca4a2c46b735481afef4fd3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/commits/4322383526db94d07ca4a2c46b735481afef4fd3","created_at":"2016-09-08T12:48:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tdurieux","id":5577568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Nzc1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5577568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux","html_url":"https://github.com/tdurieux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-19T12:38:15Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T12:38:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/issues/828","id":177773373,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNzc3NzMzNzM=","number":828,"title":"changelog
