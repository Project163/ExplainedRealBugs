The general idea is to extend the Processor and CtVisitor class in order to provide a state that can be used to determine if the process/visit method has been called from pre- or from post-order step. The state attribute ensures backward compatibility as the usage of it is optional. Unfortunately, I had to create some code duplications (the setter of the state). Maybe you should enhance the class hierarchy in order to prevent such duplications. Nonetheless, this should not (and actually is not) part of this pr. I'm unsure if calling process twice leads to errors. If yes, we could just remove it as the visit methods are the one I want to get executed twice, before and after. However, running the tests results to an error in spoon.test.intercession.IntercessionTest.testSettersAreAllGood line 202. Maybe you know whats going on here.

So let me try to clarify things.\n\na) I want to use a visitor to calculate a metric `m`.\nb) The visitor implements one of the visit methods, for instance the [visitCtMethod](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/master/src/main/java/spoon/reflect/visitor/CtVisitor.java#L293).\nc) Within this visit method, I would like to initialize `m` with a value, for instance 0, **before** the `CtMethod` is processed. By processing an element I mean applying the recursive descent.\nd) Now the recursive descent starts.\ne) In order to calculate `m` my visitor implements other visit methods as well, for instance [visitCtReturn](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/master/src/main/java/spoon/reflect/visitor/CtVisitor.java#L350).\nf) If the method mentioned in e) gets called `m` is updated (for example by incrementing `m`) .\ng) At some point the element mentioned in c) (our method element) has been processed. That is, all its children have been visited. I would like to have a function which behaves like a `postVisit`, `afterVisit`, `endVisit`, or whatever you would like to name it. JDT, for instance, provides [this](http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/dom/ASTVisitor.html#endVisit-org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.MethodDeclaration-) method. This method allows me to grab `m` and use it in further calculations.\n\nSo what do I need. I need a visit function that definitely gets called **before** processing and a visit function that definitely gets called **after** processing.\n\nMy suggestion is to extend the `CtVisitor` interface providing the functions `beforeVisit...` and `afterVisit...` for each `visit` method. Afterwards, the `ProcessingVisitor` makes usage of these methods by extending the `scan` method:\n\n``` java\n    @Override\n    @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n    public void scan(CtElement e) {\n        if (e == null) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n               // call the beforeVisit method of e\n\n        Processor<CtElement> p = (Processor<CtElement>) processor;\n        if (p.getTraversalStrategy() == TraversalStrategy.PRE_ORDER\n                && canBeProcessed(p, e)) {\n            if (p.isToBeProcessed(e)) {\n                p.process(e);\n            }\n        }\n        super.scan(e);\n        if (p.getTraversalStrategy() == TraversalStrategy.POST_ORDER\n                && canBeProcessed(p, e)) {\n            if (p.isToBeProcessed(e)) {\n                p.process(e);\n            }\n        }\n\n                // call the afterVisit method of e\n
