So the processor isn't invoked with the InnerAnnotation.\n\nexamples:\n\n``` java\n@OuterAnnotation(@MiddleAnnotation(@InnerAnnotation(\"hello\")))\npublic void test() // The InnerAnnotation will be processed\n{}\n\n@OuterAnnotation({@MiddleAnnotation(@InnerAnnotation(\"hello\")), @MiddleAnnotation(@InnerAnnotation(\"hello again\"))})\npublic void test2() // The InnerAnnotation won't be processed\n{}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/60/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/60/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
