It would be nice if one could set the actual factory of a launcher before building the model. This way, I could reuse the factory of my main model and ensure that both, my old and new types, share the same factory.\n","closed_by":{"login":"tdurieux","id":5577568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Nzc1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5577568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux","html_url":"https://github.com/tdurieux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdurieux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
