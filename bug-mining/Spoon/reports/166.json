Under Spoon 5.2.0.\nNot sure whether this is a dropped feature or a bug. \n\nThe input source code \n\n```\npackage temp;\npublic class A {\n    public static int getInt1() { return 1; }\n    public final static int getInt2() { return 2; }\n    public final int getInt3() { return 3; }    \n    public int getInt4() { return 4; }\n}\n```\n\nThe Spoon processor\n\n```\npackage spoonbug;\npublic class ExecRefProcessor extends AbstractProcessor<CtClass> {\n    @Override\n    public void process(CtClass ctClass) {\n        CtTypeReference typeRef = ctClass.getReference();\n        Collection<CtExecutableReference<?>> collectExecRef = typeRef.getDeclaredExecutables(               \n        for(CtExecutableReference execRef: collectExecRef)\n        {\n            System.out.println(\"\" + execRef.getSimpleName() + \" # isStatic()? \" + execRef.isStatic() );\n            System.out.println(\"\" + execRef.getSimpleName() + \" # isFinal()? \" + execRef.isFinal() );\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput is as follows. Then `isStatic()` does not return true for `getInt1()` and `getInt2()`\n\n```\ngetInt1 # isStatic()? false\ngetInt1 # isFinal()? false\ngetInt2 # isStatic()? false\ngetInt2 # isFinal()? true\ngetInt3 # isStatic()? false\ngetInt3 # isFinal()? true\ngetInt4 # isStatic()? false\ngetInt4 # isFinal()? false\n<init> # isStatic()? false\n<init> # isFinal()? false\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"monperrus","id":803666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzY2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus","html_url":"https://github.com/monperrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monperrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/817/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
