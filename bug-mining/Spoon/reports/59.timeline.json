You need to have a correct classpath to satisfy the JDT compiler which parses the target source code. The result of JDT is used by Spoon to build its AST. You can use the noclasspath mode but it isn't stable yet.\n\nNow, there is a real bug behind this issue when we try to build the node of a `CtInvocation`:\n\n``` java\n@SchedulerSupport(SchedulerKind.NONE)\n@SuppressWarnings({ \"unchecked\", \"rawtypes\"})\npublic final NbpObservable<List<T>> toSortedList() {\n    return toSortedList((Comparator)Comparator.naturalOrder());\n}\n```\n\nThe method declaration of `Comparator.naturalOrder()` is:\n\n``` java\n@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\npublic static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> Comparator<T> naturalOrder() {\n    return (Comparator<T>) Comparators.NaturalOrderComparator.INSTANCE;\n}\n```\n\nAnd the generic type `T` is tricky. When we want to build the return type `Comparator<T>` in a `CtTypeReference`, Spoon throws a `StackOverflowException`. JDT gives us the same instance of `T` at the beginning of the generic type and at the end (in `? super T`).\n\nI'm working on a solution but it isn't simple.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/comments/147972101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GerardPaligot","id":1913901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot","html_url":"https://github.com/GerardPaligot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":434934190,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDM0OTM0MTkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/434934190","actor":{"login":"JakeWharton","id":66577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton","html_url":"https://github.com/JakeWharton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-14T08:25:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":434934191,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzNDkzNDE5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/events/434934191","actor":{"login":"JakeWharton","id":66577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton","html_url":"https://github.com/JakeWharton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-14T08:25:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"GerardPaligot","id":1913901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot","html_url":"https://github.com/GerardPaligot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerardPaligot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-14T13:14:37Z","updated_at":"2015-10-14T13:14:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon/issues/372","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INRIA/spoon","labels_url":"ht
