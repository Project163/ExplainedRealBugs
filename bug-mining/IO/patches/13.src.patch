   - This now handles the situation where an error occurs when deleting the file
 
 - IOUtils.copy [IO-84]
-  - The copy(InputStream, OutputStream) method now throws an exception if

-  - The copy(Reader, Writer) method now throws an exception if

   - Added a new copyLarge(InputStream, OutputStream) method that returns a long

 - CountingInputStream/CountingOutputStream [IO-84]
-  - methods were declared as int thus the count was innacurate for large streams

   - new long based methods getByteCount()/resetByteCount() added
