[commit introducing `expectExceptionMessageMatches`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commit/d1199cb2e43a934b51521656be9748f63febe18e) says that `expectExceptionMessageRegExp` will trigger a warning in 9 and be removed in 10.\r\nBut the 9.0 removed the method entirely instead of adding a warning in it. This means that the method got removed without ever reporting a deprecation warning when running tests using it.\r\nAnd there is no changelog saying that this method is deprecated (the PHPUnit 8 changelog does not talk about deprecating `expectExceptionMessageRegExp` and the PHPUnit 9 changelog says it is removed).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
