If they are slow, we want them to fail. Adding `@small` to every (100s) test class is a bit verbose and prone to forgetting to add it for new unit test classes.\r\n\r\nSolution < v10:\r\n--\r\nWe had a `UnitTestCase` that extended `TestCase`. That class overrode the `getSize` method to return `return PHPUnit\\Util\\Test::SMALL`. (I know `getSize` was marked as internal, but it was a workaround for the time being). All of our unit tests extended `UnitTestCase`.\r\n\r\nProposal :\r\n--\r\nIt would be nice if there was a way to mark a directory as a certain size or if the `@small` annotation could be added to parent classes. In our case, we could add the `@small` annotation to `UnitTestCase` and then all of the children of that class would inherit that annotation.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
