Configure testdox via XML or CLI params:\n\n```\n<log type=\"testdox-html\" target=\"../logs/testdox/testdox.html\"/>\n<log type=\"testdox-text\" target=\"../logs/testdox/testdox.txt\"/>\n```\n1. Create an empty file \"logs/testdox\" and run phpunit.\n2. Run phpunit:\n\n```\nvendor/bin/phpunit tests\n```\n\nI only stumbled upon this because I created a single HTML testfox file at first and then reconfigured to use the same path for both - HTML & text version.\n### Fix\n\nPrinter seems to assume that if it's not a dir, it doesn't exist. Perhaps it would be better if an exception was thrown? E.g.:\n\n```\nif (strpos($out, 'php://') === FALSE &&\n  !is_dir(dirname($out) && !is_file($out))) {\n    mkdir(dirname($out), 0777, TRUE);\n  }\n  else {\n    throw new PHPUnit_Framework_Exception(\"Unable to create a log directory\");\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
