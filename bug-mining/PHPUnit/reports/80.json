Another option I looked into was to add these include_paths to a php script using\n\n```\nset_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . 'mypath' . '/php-file-iterator/');\n```\n\nfor example...  but then I will need to be able to run phpunit directly from within that script, and I Don't see any documentation on how to do that.\n\nI would expect something like:  `PHPUnit_File_Command::run(\"some_path_to_my_test_file.php\");`\n\nSorry if this is the wrong forum to ask for help. I looked for other likely candidates. #phpunit is dead :/\n","closed_by":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
