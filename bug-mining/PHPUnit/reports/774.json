The chained method will then return a TestStub for that class instead of a MockObject, which is not compatible with the method return type and crashes with a type error.\r\n\r\nI don't quite understand why, where and how a TestStub is created, but I found the problem where the mix up happens. The problem is because there's a TestStub / MockObject cache, but the generated cache key doesn't differentiate between TestStub and MockObject. See:\r\n\r\nClass: `PHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Generator\\Generator`\r\nMethod: `generate`\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```php\r\n$key = md5(\r\n    $type .\r\n    serialize($methods) .\r\n    serialize($callOriginalClone) .\r\n    serialize($cloneArguments) .\r\n    serialize($callOriginalMethods),\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy temp fix that seems to work. Add the $mockObject status into the cache key:\r\n```php\r\n$key = md5(\r\n    $type .\r\n    ($mockObject ? 'mock' : 'stub') .\r\n    serialize($methods) .\r\n    serialize($callOriginalClone) .\r\n    serialize($cloneArguments) .\r\n    serialize($callOriginalMethods),\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
