needed.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/14482272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":40320583,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDAzMjA1ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/40320583","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-03-06T04:37:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":40320584,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwMzIwNTg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/40320584","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-03-06T04:37:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-13T07:14:52Z","updated_at":"2013-03-13T07:14:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"http

The current process isolation template conflicts with modern PHP programming practices.  We can overhaul it in many small, possibly backwards-compatible steps, or we can replace it with a completely revamped template, targeting the next major release (sadly, 4.x is out already), but ASAP.  Fixing this and related bugs is mostly a matter of BC and release management.  The goal and user expectation is clear, but before anyone is able to work on anything, a strategy needs to be defined.  Project maintainers will raise their voice, but a change like this affects 99.9% of all tests in the wild, so better think twice and share your thoughts on how we can possibly achieve this _**without breaking YOUR tests.**_\n\n---\n\nBased on my recent debugging work, it's fairly clear to me that the process isolation script template (+ injected data) requires a major overhaul.\n\nThe current template + data processing seems to originate from a time in which procedural code was the state of art, and most projects either did not need a bootstrap file or they used it to prime tons of global state constructs in unholy ways. — Do you remember good ol' times?\n\nThe current template nicely resembles PHP4 programming practices:  (1) php.ini, (2) user-space constants, (3) include files, (4) global variables, and only after futzing with all that global state, (5) boot and execute your test.\n\nThat made total sense.  Back then. :wink: \n\nNow, let me go out on a limb and say:  Today, for modern PHP5 code, the bootstrap file is **exclusively** used to (1) load + register a class loader and (2) register your namespaces.\n\nIn turn, the **only** job of the process isolation template is to boot your bootstrap file.  Everything else is handled differently; to reiterate above PHP4 list:\n1. Modern PHP5 code doesn't rely on PHP INI settings.  Backing up + injecting the total state of INI settings into the child process is obsolete.  If your code requires custom INI settings, then your bootstrap file will set them anyway already. (cf. #1343)\n2. Constants are defined in interfaces and classes.  Legacy constants are defined by legacy include files (see below).  Defining constants ahead of time is obsolete.\n3. Legacy/procedural include files are loaded by your bootstrap file (if they need to be loaded at all).  Loading them ahead of time is obsolete.\n4. Global variables are gone.  If your code relies on custom globals, your bootstrap file will set them anyway already.  Setting them ahead of time is obsolete.\n5. Every test, regardless of whether in isolation or not, does exactly two things:  Execute the bootstrap file, and execute the test.\n\n→ The process isolation environment priming script template is reduced to (5).\n\nEvery test process is expected to boot from a clean slate, just like the initial/original phpunit process itself.  Your bootstrap file adds a class loader, so your test class is found.  It may also configure INI settings or even prime global state, but the bootstrap file is the single and only entry point for all tests.\n\nGive or take #1343, you can achieve that modern, desired process isolation environment by undoing most of the global state backup in the base class of your tests (you should have one, regardless of whether you currently need one) like this:\n\n``` php\n  protected $preserveGlobalState = FALSE;\n\n  protected function prepareTemplate(\\Text_Template $template) {\n    $template->setVar(array(\n      'iniSettings' => '',\n      'constants' => '',\n      'included_files' => '',\n      'globals' => '$GLOBALS[\\'__PHPUNIT_BOOTSTRAP\\'] = ' . var_export($GLOBALS['__PHPUNIT_BOOTSTRAP'], TRUE) . \";\\n\",\n    ));\n  }\n```\n\nThis effectively force-reduces the process isolation template to the max:  the bootstrap file.\n\nThe current state of the to be executed test is captured and forwarded in separate template variables, so no worries, your isolated tests will still execute correctly.\n\nFor modern PHP5 code, this matters in multiple ways:\n1. There is no global state.\n   - In order to inject global state, you do so explicitly.\n   - Template variables allow you to forward desired data to the child process.  Your bootstrap file consumes them.\n   - Let's have dedicated ways for doing so in the framework.\n2. Customized INI settings must not leak.\n   - ~~Currently, the global state of INI settings of the parent process leaks into child processes, whatever those INI settings may be, and regardless of whether a previous test method temporarily adjusted them.~~ — Sorry, that's wrong. INI settings are backed up + restored for every single test run, even.  Always, regardless of process isolation.\n   - If you're relying on any INI settings, your bootstrap file **has to** re-set all mission-critical INI settings to guarantee reliable test results.\n3. Global constants are defined by your legacy code, but only if and when that code is loaded.\n   - Defining global constants upfront causes all of your legacy code to trigger PHP errors upon getting loaded, causing test failures.\n   - Wrapping all of your legacy global constant definitions into a `if (!defined('MY_CONSTANT'))` does not make any sense.\n4. The backup of included files loads your bootstrap file before loading the class loader, which may cause your class loader to get loaded twice.\n   \n   ``` php\n   require_once 'tests\\bootstrap.php';\n   require_once 'vendor\\autoload.php';\n   ```\n5. The backup of includes files can load up to hundreds (or even thousands) of classes that are irrelevant for the executed test.  The backup simply contains each and every file that your class loader has loaded up until the process isolation for a particular test gets triggered.  This typically means your whole application code + most of its dependencies.\n   - Loading code consumes (potentially megabytes of) memory, and depending on your filesystem/hardware, loading many individual files may be slow.  Avoiding to load code that isn't needed is the whole purpose of class loaders.\n6. The backup of global variables contains a complete backup of PHP super-globals, which your modern PHP5 code avoids and ignores anyway:\n   \n   ``` php\n   ...\n   $GLOBALS['_SERVER']['HOME'] = 'c:/Users/sun';\n   $GLOBALS['_SERVER']['PROMPT'] = '$P$G';\n   $GLOBALS['_SERVER']['TMP'] = 'C:/Users/sun/AppData/Local/Temp';\n   ...\n   ```\n7. The backup of global variables contains a (complete) backup of all variables that happen to be defined in your bootstrap file - which may or may not disrupt the global state of your tests in isolation:\n   \n   ``` php\n   $loader = require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';\n   ```\n   \n   ``` php\n   $GLOBALS['loader'] = unserialize('O:29:\"Composer\\\\Autoload\\\\ClassLoader\":7:{s:48:\"' . \"\\0\" . 'Composer\\\\Autoload\\\\ClassLoader' . \"\\0\" ......\n   ```\n8. I _could_ go on, but omitting the rest for brevity...\n\nNow, every modern project with reasonably complex tests needs to figure out the entirety of this on its own.  The vast majority of users most likely isn't even aware of some of the issues listed above.  (I wasn't either, until I had to deep-dive into the code in order to fix other process isolation bugs.)\n\nLikewise, the fact that `$preserveGlobalState` is enabled by default definitely appears to trip up pretty much every new user.\n\nThe stated bug(s) in this and related issues are just simply symptoms of a PHP4-era process isolation template architecture.  It probably worked fine for years, and personally, I even had a very positive \"WOW\" moment when I initially discovered this mechanism.  However, it had it's time, its time is over.\n\nThe question is how to get from status quo to a completely revised process isolation architecture?  There are two options:\n1. Fix individual issues (like this) step by step.  This focuses on backwards-compatibility; i.e., incremental fixes _may_ be backportable to stable release branches.  Every single change to the process isolation template needs to account for the possibility of custom templates (like the very hack I'm suggesting above).\n2. Replace the template with a completely new one.  Potentially remove all the code responsible for backing up stuff that is obsolete.  Obviously, this ain't backportable and targets a new major release (or minor; PHPUnit doesn't really seem to follow strict SemVer).  This effectively means that process isolation starts from scratch, and _your_ current tests _may_ break.\n   - BC is hard, because literally everything extends from `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase`, but just as an idea:  \n     Normally this is the domain of interfaces, but it _may_ be possible to generally address the topic of BC by introducing version-specific code paths specifically for process isolation; i.e., if you assume the current version is 1.0, your current `prepareTemplate()` method would be invoked as-is; but if your class implements `prepareTemplate2()` instead, we're going to hook up your isolated test process using the new model.  Better ideas welcome ;)\n\nLong story short:\n\nThe question isn't whether there are bugs, the question is how we can fix them without breaking _all of your tests._ :wink:

contributor,\n\nlet me start by apologizing for not commenting and/or working on the issue you have reported or merging the pull request you have sent sooner.\n\nPHPUnit 5.0 was released today. And today I am closing all open bug reports and pull requests for PHPUnit and its dependencies that I maintain. Please do not interpret the closing of this ticket as an insult or a lack of interest in your problem. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nIf the topic of this ticket is still relevant then please open a new ticket or send a new pull request. If your ticket or pull request is about a defect then please check whether the issue still exists in PHPUnit 4.8 (which will received bug fixes until August 2016). If your ticket or pull request is about a new feature then please port your patch PHPUnit 5.0 before sending a new pull request.\n\nI hope that today's extreme backlog grooming will allow me to respond to bug reports and pull requests in a more timely manner in the future.\n\nThank you for your understanding,\nSebastian\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/144912744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":424918293,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI0OTE4Mjkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/424918293","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:19:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
