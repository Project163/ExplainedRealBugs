The assertTag is wonderfull to check it, but it fails in some cases, see below. \n\nDoes assertTag do any HTML validation too? I know that some examples are invalid html, therefore I set isHTML to skip maybe any HTML validation to false, but with the same result.\n\n```\n1) RenderTest::testRender with data set #9 ('area', false, '<area>SomeText</area>')\nFailed asserting that false is true.\n\n\n2) RenderTest::testRender with data set #19 ('param', false, '<param>SomeText</param>')\nFailed asserting that false is true.\n\n\n3) RenderTest::testRender with data set #34 ('base', false, '<base>SomeText</base>')\nFailed asserting that false is true.\n\n\n4) RenderTest::testRender with data set #36 ('head', false, '<head>SomeText</head>')\nFailed asserting that false is true.\n\n\n5) RenderTest::testRender with data set #40 ('script', false, '<script>SomeText</script>')\nFailed asserting that false is true.\n\n\n6) RenderTest::testRender with data set #41 ('style', false, '<style>SomeText</style>')\nFailed asserting that false is true.\n\n\n7) RenderTest::testRender with data set #44 ('col', false, '<col>SomeText</col>')\nFailed asserting that false is true.´´´\n```\n\nEDIT: Ok after fixing self closing tags, there are only two issues\n\n```\n1) RenderTest::testRender with data set #40 ('script', false, false, '<script>SomeText</script>')\nFailed asserting that false is true.\n\n\n2) RenderTest::testRender with data set #41 ('style', false, false, '<style>SomeText</style>')\nFailed asserting that false is true.\n```\n\nBut the question is the same? HTML validation? Does it  validate the innerHTML also? Even if isHTML set to false?\n\nEdit by @edorian: Fixed markdown\n","closed_by":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/763/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
