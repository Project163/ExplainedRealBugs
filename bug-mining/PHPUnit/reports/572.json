The issue here is that there isn't any other way to do the same operation, adding new classes to the blacklist to exclude them from error stack traces.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to have any kind of extension point to obtain the same result without relying on an internal class?\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\nCrash like this: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/36499#issuecomment-616365995\r\n```\r\nError: Access to undeclared static property: PHPUnit\\Util\\Blacklist::$blacklistedClassNames\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n * Use PHPUnit 9.1.2 with the PHPUnit bridge\r\n * run any test\r\n * get a \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nNo issues","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4186/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
