callback is an object and it's passed by reference. Test fails with:\n\n```\n1) Test::testCallback\nExpectation failed for method name is equal to <string:bar> when invoked zero or more times\nParameter 0 for invocation Foo::bar(Array (), 0, 0) does not match expected value.\nArray () does not match expected type \"object\".\n\nTest.php:23\n```\n\nI realize objects are passed by reference anyway and defining references in the method signature is not needed. However,  this is a valid scenario if a method accepts either object or array.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-mock-objects/issues/116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-mock-objects/issues/116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/12859901","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/796#issuecomment-12859901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/796","id":12859901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODU5OTAx","user":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-29T21:44:04Z","updated_at":"2013-01-29T21:44:27Z","body":"Thanks for the detailed bug report.
