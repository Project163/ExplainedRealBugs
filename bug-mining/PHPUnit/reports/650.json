Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\r\n>\r\n> — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)\r\n\r\nPHPUnit currently refers to \"fields\" (see above) as \"attributes\". This is (or will become) confusing considering the introduction of [attributes in PHP 8](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2) and [their support in PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4502).\r\n\r\nPHPUnit will be changed to use the term \"property\" instead of \"attribute\" where \"field\" is meant.\r\n\r\nPHPUnit can optionally create a backup of static fields before each test and restore these fields from that backup after each test. This functionality is controlled by\r\n\r\n* the `backupStaticAttributes` attribute on the `<phpunit>` root element of PHPUnit's XML configuration file\r\n* the `--static-backup` CLI option\r\n* the `@backupStaticAttributes` annotation\r\n* the `BackupStaticProperties` attribute (as of PHP 8 and PHPUnit 10)\r\n\r\nThe `backupStaticAttributes` attribute will be deprecated in PHPUnit 10. [It will be removed in PHPUnit 11.](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4604) A new `backupStaticProperties` attribute will implemented to replace it. The XML configuration file migrator will be expanded to handle this change.\r\n\r\nThe  `--static-backup` CLI option does not need to be renamed, only its help text will be updated to use \"properties\" instead of \"attributes\".\r\n\r\nSupport for metadata in comments (using the the `@backupStaticAttributes` annotation, for example) will be deprecated in PHPUnit 11 (February 2022) and removed in PHPUnit 12 (February 2023). Therefore, I do not think it's sensible to deprecate `@backupStaticAttributes` now and introduce a `@backupStaticProperties` replacement that will itself be deprecated within a year.","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
