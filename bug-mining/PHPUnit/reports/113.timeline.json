 the problem as i can see it is that at that stage the constraint just has an error message that was generated somewhere earlier in the chain and so it doesn't know within that scope what part of the message is phpunit text, and what part is the output from the expression that was being tested.\n\nso one approach could be a more specific pattern matching, but i'm thinking that might not be able to catch everything.\n\na slightly more disruptive change would be for phpunit to generate it's text as a kind of simplistic template language and then right before it gets sent back, the search/replace happens.\n\nfor example the first constrain could generate a message like this:\n\n```\nFailed asserting that 'username not required' {{contains}} \"required\"\n```\n\nThen the Not constraint would be able to locate text generated by phpunit because it is surrounded by brackets and could safely replace {{contains}} with {{does not contain}}.\n\nLastly at the very end just before the result message is sent back, a global function could look for any template vars and replace them.\n\nIt seems kinda overkill for such a minor thing but I'm not sure there is a better way without doing some major plumbing changes.

And today I am closing all open bug reports and pull requests for PHPUnit and its dependencies that I maintain. Please do not interpret the closing of this ticket as an insult or a lack of interest in your problem. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nIf the topic of this ticket is still relevant then please open a new ticket or send a new pull request. If your ticket or pull request is about a defect then please check whether the issue still exists in PHPUnit 4.8 (which will received bug fixes until August 2016). If your ticket or pull request is about a new feature then please port your patch PHPUnit 5.0 before sending a new pull request.\n\nI hope that today's extreme backlog grooming will allow me to respond to bug reports and pull requests in a more timely manner in the future.\n\nThank you for your understanding,\nSebastian\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/144912568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":424917346,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI0OTE3MzQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/424917346","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:17:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":424917352,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50NDI0OTE3MzUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/424917352","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:17:06Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
