A very simple example:\n\n``` php\n<?php\ninterface ArrayInterface extends \\ArrayAccess, \\Countable, \\Traversable {}\n\n// The implementation can chose to implement \\Iterator...\nclass Array1 implements \\Iterator, ArrayInterface\n{\n    ...\n}\n\n// or \\IteratorAggregate\nclass Array2 implements \\IteratorAggregate, ArrayInterface\n{\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nInterfaces usually specify a contract, without specifying _how_ that contract should be implemented. These core interfaces are special in that `\\Traversable` specifies the contract (\"This object should be iterable\") while `\\Iterator` and `\\IteratorAggregate` specify how that contract is implemented. Consequently, no userland interface should them, but always `\\Traversable` IMHO.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/7307602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"webmozart","id":176399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjM5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart","html_url":"https://github.com/webmozart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webmozart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/7309543","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/604#issuecomment-7309543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/604","id":7309543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDk1NDM=","user":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-07-27T16:20:30Z","updated_at":"2012-07-27T16:20:30Z","body":"So what the interface is saying there is \"I can foreach over things that implement this but i don't care how the implementing class makes that happen (Iterator or IteratorAggregate).\n\nMakes sense to me.

from sebastianbergmann/phpunit#604\n\nCurrently, PHPUnit fails when trying to mock an interface that implements `\\Traversable` because PHP expects implementations of that interface to also either implement `\\Iterator` or `\\IteratorAggregate`.\n\n``` php\n<?php\n\ninterface MyInterface extends \\Traversable {}\n\n// doesn't work\n$this->getMock('MyInterface');\n```\n\nThe fix currently is to extend the interface for testing purposes and to add one of the two required interfaces (_Note_: The order of the interfaces is important here!)\n\n``` php\n<?php\n\ninterface TestMyInterface extends \\Iterator, MyInterface {}\n\n// works\n$this->getMock('TestMyInterface');\n```\n\nIMO PHPUnit should be able to add that interface automatically in such situations, i.e.:\n- when the mock is created for an interface or an abstract class, and\n- that interface/abstract class implements `\\Traversable`, but not `\\Iterator` nor `\\IteratorAggregate`\n\nFor reference, see

Documentation PR | none |\n#### What's in this PR?\n\nTwo tests were still containing its own implementation from the `PHPCR\\NodeInterface`. This was relevant back in the days, because of a bug in PHPUnit (https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/604).\n#### Why?\n\nIntelliJ also offered the implementations from these tests as suggestions, so you ended up sometimes to use the wrong

have an interface that extends from `\\IteratorAggregate`, like so:\r\n\r\n```php\r\ninterface IDbStatement extends \\IteratorAggregate\r\n{\r\n    public function Execute(array $parameters =

`\\Traversable`:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * Interface to create an external Iterator.\r\n * @link http://php.net/manual/en/class.iteratoraggregate.php\r\n */\r\ninterface IteratorAggregate extends
