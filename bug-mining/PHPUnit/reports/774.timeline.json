is documented to return `Stub&$type` whereas `createMock($type)` is documented to return `MockObject&$type`. Under the hood, however, both `createStub($type)` and `createMock($type)` generate and return `MockObject&$type` for legacy reasons at the moment.\r\n\r\nIn a future major version of PHPUnit `createStub()` will be changed to generate and return `Stub&$type`. This means that `expects()` will no longer be available on test double objects created using `createStub()`. For PHPUnit 10.4, the foundation for this change was laid: the test double code generator now uses a flag, `$mockObject` to control whether a test stub (`false`) or a mock object  (`true`) should be created. All code paths, except the one used by the return value generator, unconditionally pass `true` to the test double code generator to maintain backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nWhen a test stub is requested for `OriginalType` then the name of the generated class is `TestStub_OriginalType_random`. When a mock object is requested for `OriginalType` then the name of the generated class is `MockObject_OriginalType_random`.\r\n\r\nHowever, and like you already noticed, the key for the cache for generated code did not distinguish between test stubs and mock objects.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1751922199/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10583283577,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbWLc5zHSQgzwAAAAJ20Bd5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/10583283577","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"afd049d2ca5d121cc885e81a3a8650bffd0dac1a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commits/afd049d2ca5d121cc885e81a3a8650bffd0dac1a","created_at":"2023-10-08T05:06:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10583283584,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAbWLc5zHSQgzwAAAAJ20BeA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/10583283584","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"afd049d2ca5d121cc885e81a3a8650bffd0dac1a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commits/afd049d2ca5d121cc885e81a3a8650bffd0dac1a","created_at":"2023-10-08T05:06:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
