Summary\r\n\r\nWhen creating a mock using `$this->createMockForIntersectionOfInterfaces()`, the created MockObject is not registered in the test case. Because of this, failing expectations are not triggered when the test completes.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\n`createMockForIntersectionOfInterfaces()` does not call `registerMockObject`, which means failing expectations are not flagged as a test failure.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`createMockForIntersectionOfInterfaces()` calls `registerMockObject` just like `createMock()` does.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nuse PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase;\r\n\r\nclass Example\r\n{\r\n    public function __construct(private \\Stringable $object)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function count(): int\r\n    {\r\n        if ($this->object instanceof \\Countable) {\r\n            return $this->object->count();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ExampleTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    public function testCount(): void\r\n    {\r\n        $withCountable = $this->createMockForIntersectionOfInterfaces(\r\n            [\r\n                \\Stringable::class,\r\n                \\Iterator::class,\r\n                \\Countable::class,\r\n            ]\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        $withoutCountable = $this->createMockForIntersectionOfInterfaces(\r\n            [\r\n                \\Stringable::class,\r\n                \\Iterator::class,\r\n            ]\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        //$this->registerMockObject($withCountable);\r\n        //$this->registerMockObject($withoutCountable);\r\n\r\n        $withCountable->expects(self::once())\r\n                      ->method('count');\r\n\r\n        $withoutCountable->expects(self::never())\r\n                         ->method(self::anything());\r\n\r\n        // lazy copy/pasting: one of these should be withCountable.\r\n        // $withCountable is unused, therefore the count method is never called and the expectation should fail\r\n        (new Example($withoutCountable))->count();\r\n        (new Example($withoutCountable))->count();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning PHPUnit outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPHPUnit 10.4.2 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\r\n\r\nRuntime:       PHP 8.2.12\r\n\r\n\r\nThis test did not perform any assertions\r\nTime: 00:00.012, Memory: 8.00 MB\r\n\r\nThere was 1 risky test:\r\n\r\n1) ExampleTest::testCount\r\nThis test did not perform any assertions\r\n\r\n/path/to/ExampleTest.php:23\r\n\r\nOK, but there were issues!\r\nTests: 1, Assertions: 0, Risky: 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: PHPUnit exits with exit code 0, meaning if this is the only \"failing\" test, CI will happily proceed.\r\n\r\nManually registering the mocks (something `createMock()` does automatically for you) by enabling the registerMockObject lines works as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\n        $this->registerMockObject($withCountable);\r\n        $this->registerMockObject($withoutCountable);\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nPHPUnit 10.4.2 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\r\n\r\nRuntime:       PHP 8.2.12\r\n\r\n\r\nExpectation failed for method name is \"count\" when invoked 1 time.\r\nMethod was expected to be called 1 time, actually called 0 times.\r\n\r\nTime: 00:00.014, Memory: 8.00 MB\r\n\r\nThere was 1 failure:\r\n\r\n1) ExampleTest::testCount\r\nExpectation failed for method name is \"count\" when invoked 1 time.\r\nMethod was expected to be called 1 time, actually called 0 times.\r\n\r\nFAILURES!\r\nTests: 1, Assertions: 1, Failures: 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the expectation causes a test failure and PHPUnit exits with exit code 1, interrupting CI flow as it should.","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
