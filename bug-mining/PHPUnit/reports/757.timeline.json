Pull Request Type\r\n\r\n- [x] I have checked there is no other PR open for the same change.\r\n\r\nThis is a:\r\n- [ ] Bug fix\r\n- [ ] New feature\r\n- [ ] Documentation improvement\r\n- [x] Code quality improvement\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nUpdate the test suite to allow for running the tests on PHPUnit 10.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Description\r\n\r\n### Composer: update the PHPUnit Polyfills\r\n\r\nA PHPUnit 10 compatible version of the PHPUnit Polyfills has been released, so let's start using it.\r\n\r\nRef:\r\n* https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills/releases/tag/2.0.0\r\n\r\n### Transport/BaseTestCase::dataSNISupport(): remove unused and unnecessary method parameter\r\n\r\nData providers cannot take arguments, so this `$options` parameter is useless and should never have been declared. PHPUnit 10 will flag it, so let's remove it.\r\n\r\n### TestCase::textArrayToDataprovider(): make static\r\n\r\nThis method is used exclusively by data providers and as of PHPUnit 10, data providers should be static methods, so this method needs to be `static` too.\r\n\r\n### TestCase::transportProvider(): make static\r\n\r\nThis method is used exclusively as a data providers and as of PHPUnit 10, data providers should be static methods, so this method needs to be `static` too.\r\n\r\n### TestCase: split httpbin() method and make Session\\ConstructorTest::dataValidUrl() method static\r\n\r\nAs of PHPUnit 10, data providers are (again) expected to be `static` methods.\r\n\r\nOne of the data providers is using the `httpbin()` method, but as the `httpbin()` method needs `$this` to handle the test skipping, the method cannot be made static.\r\n\r\nThis commit splits the `httpbin()` method into three methods:\r\n* A `skipOnUnavailableHttpbinHost()` method which contains the test skip check.\r\n* A `static` `getHttpbinUrl()` method which builds the URL.\r\n* The original `httpbin()` method which now calls the two new methods to maintain the same functionality as before.\r\n\r\nBy splitting the method in this way, we prevent having to change all method calls to the `httpbin()` method throughout the test suite and can still fix the data provider method using the `httpbin()` method to not use `$this` (which allows to make it `static`).\r\n\r\n### Tests: make dataproviders static\r\n\r\nAs of PHPUnit 10, data providers are (again) expected to be `static` methods.\r\n\r\nThis updates the test suite to respect that.\r\n\r\nIncludes removing the use of `$this` from select data providers.\r\n\r\n### Tests: replace assertObjectHasAttribute() with `assertObjectHasProperty()`\r\n\r\nThe `assertObjectHasAttribute()` method has been deprecated in PHPUnit 9 and removed in PHPUnit 10.\r\n\r\nPHPUnit 10.1 introduces a replacement `assertObjectHasProperty()` method, which is polyfilled by the PHPUnit Polyfills.\r\n\r\nThis switches all uses of the old method to the new method name.\r\n\r\n### Tests: work around for MockBuilder::setMethods() removal\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\n* The `getMockBuilder()` method is also deprecated now, so replacing with another method call on the `MockBuilder` class will only work in the short/medium term and in a future iteration, this will have to be refactored again.\r\n* The `addMethods()` method has been (soft) deprecated in PHPUnit 10.1 and is expected to be removed in PHPUnit 12.\r\n\r\nAlso see #814\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#3687#issuecomment-492537584\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#3770\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#3769\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#4775\r\n\r\n### Tests: work around for removal of expectDeprecation et al\r\n\r\nPHPUnit will no longer stop a test on deprecations/notices/warnings.\r\nThis also means that the PHPUnit native way to expect deprecations/notices/warnings etc is no longer supported.\r\n\r\nThis implements a work-around for the limited cases in which that functionality was used in this test suite.\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n* https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-10.html\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#5062\r\n\r\n### Curl/Fsockopen: add some extra defensive coding\r\n\r\nThe `error_get_last()` function can return `null` if no error occurred, in which case, the `throw new Exception()` statement will run into two new errors:\r\n* `Trying to access array offset on value of type null` for accessing `$error['message']`.\r\n* ... which then leads to a `Exception::__construct(): Passing null to parameter #1 ($message) of type string is deprecated`.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds some defensive coding to handle the hypothetical situation that `error_get_last()` would return `null` when a file could not be opened.\r\n\r\nNote: this is actually a bug in PHPUnit 10 which breaks `error_get_last()`.\r\nWe should be able to remove the extra defensive coding once the upstream bug has been fixed.\r\n\r\nUpstream bug report: sebastianbergmann/phpunit#5428\r\n\r\n### PHPUnit: add separate configuration for PHPUnit 10\r\n\r\nPHPUnit 10 makes significant changes to the configuration file.\r\n\r\nMost notably:\r\n* In PHPUnit 9.3, the manner of specifying the code coverage configuration has changed.\r\n* In PHPUnit 10.0, a significant number of attributes of the `<phpunit>` element were removed or renamed.\r\n* In PHPUnit 10.1, the manner of specifying code coverage has changed again.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a `--migrate-configuration` option available in PHPUnit, that doesn't get us a well enough converted configuration file, so instead use a separate `phpunit10.xml.dist` file for running the tests on PHPUnit 10 with an optimal configuration.\r\n\r\nIncludes:\r\n* Ignoring the new file for package archives.\r\n* Adding separate scripts to the `composer.json` file to make how to run the tests on PHPUnit 10 more obvious for contributors.\r\n* Updating the GH Actions workflows to take the new configuration file into account when appropriate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WordPress/Requests/issues/817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WordPress/Requests/issues/817/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1607503249","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5428#issuecomment-1607503249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5428","id":1607503249,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbWLc5f0I2R","user":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-26T13:43:55Z","updated_at":"2023-06-26T13:43:55Z","body":"I

But I will not investigate this issue myself.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1607503249/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9639170995,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAbWLc5pyQ-mzwAAAAI-ihOz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/9639170995","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-26T13:44:02Z","label":{"name":"feature/test-runner","color":"e9b96e"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1607588059","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5428#issuecomment-1607588059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5428","id":1607588059,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbWLc5f0djb","user":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-26T14:15:42Z","updated_at":"2023-06-26T14:15:42Z","body":"PHPUnit's error handler returns `true` after it handled an `E_*` error emitted by PHP.

Since #5428, the `#[WithoutErrorHandler]` attribute can be used to disable PHPUnit's error handler for a test method.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of static analysis tools such as Psalm and PHPStan, PHPUnit should support the concept of a [baseline](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/baseline) to\r\n\r\n> declare the currently reported list of errors as “the baseline” and cause it not being reported in subsequent runs. It allows you to be interested in [issues] only in new and changed code\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement `baseline` attribute on the `<source>` element of PHPUnit's XML configuration file to configure the path to the baseline file to be used\r\n- [x] Implement `--generate-baseline` CLI option to generate a baseline file (at the location configured in the XML configuration file, see above)\r\n- [x] Make paths in `Issue` objects relative to `baseline.xml` location\r\n- [x] Use the baseline (when it is configured) to not display information about `E_(USER_)DEPRECATED`, `E_(USER_)NOTICE`, `E_STRICT`, and `E_(USER_)WARNING` issues that are \"baselined\"\r\n- [x] Change `--generate-baseline` CLI option (see above) to require the specification of the path to where the baseline file should be written\r\n- [x] Implement `--use-baseline <path>` CLI option to specify the baseline file to be used\r\n- [x] Implement `--ignore-baseline` CLI option to ignore the baseline\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-12T06:30:42Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T06:30:42Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-english/issues/330","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-english","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-english/issues/330/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-english/issues/330/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-english/issues/330/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-english/issues/330","id":1890475382,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxhKgM5wrl12","number":330,"title":"Document

Composer\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\n`error_get_last()` is not set when errors are logged (PHPUnit error handler is active). The errors are logged by default which is a good. But the current impl. of the error handler causes code that relies on `error_get_last()` set after a core php function has returned a failure like:\r\n```\r\n$dirHandle = opendir($dirPath);\r\nif ($dirHandle === false) {\r\n    $errorMessage = preg_replace('~^.+?:\\s*~s', '', error_get_last()['message']);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto fail as `error_get_last()` is empty.\r\n\r\nThis is because the current impl. of the error handler returns `true` [1] when an error is handled. The php docs say [2]:\r\n> It is important to remember that the standard PHP error handler is completely bypassed for the error types specified by error_levels unless the callback function returns false.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/10.4.2/src/Runner/ErrorHandler.php#L144\r\n[2] https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php\r\n\r\nThe issue is present since PHPUnit 10, in PHPUnit 9 and lower `error_get_last()` was set correctly.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$dirHandle = opendir('/--non-existing-path--');\r\nself::assertNotNull(error_get_last());\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe PHPUnit handler should:\r\n1. log an error\r\n2. suppress its output\r\n3. not affect the `error_get_last()` result, the result must be the same /w and /wo PHPUnit error handler active\r\n\r\nI tried to workaround about this issue https://3v4l.org/kS1vM/rfc#vgit.master but if the output is suppressed by lowering the reporting level when handling the error, it seems there is no way to restore the level back immediatelly after the error handling is finished.\r\n\r\nI belive the solution is to modify the PHPUnit error handler:\r\n1. to return `false` when handling the error - it will let php to handle the error natively\r\n2. to backup the current `error_reporting()` level and set it to `error_reporting(error_reporting() & (E_ERROR | E_PARSE | E_CORE_ERROR | E_CORE_WARNING | E_COMPILE_ERROR | E_COMPILE_WARNING))` when the handler activates (the listed error levels cannot be handled by an user handler [2])\r\n3. to restore the backed error level when the error handler deactivates (or better increase the current error level if lower than the backed one)\r\n4. https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commit/e676667054ec44e55678a87dc7d8ee8b0a3637ba original fix and https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commit/c2c8dbbd80b6e5c5ec98c844b37661f575908c7f can be reverted then, no `WithoutErrorHandler` attribute

Note: I apologise,  I originally wrote this issue when using orchestra/testbench (Laravel). However I dug further into Laravel to find out the relevant factor (it sets an error handler),  and have updated this issue to use only PHPUnit.

The first one (alphabetically) will register an error handler.\r\n\r\n``` php\r\n<?php\r\n// ATest.php\r\n\r\nuse PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase;\r\n\r\nclass ATest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    public static function test_something_a(): void\r\n    {\r\n        set_error_handler([self::class, 'handleError']);\r\n\r\n        print \"\\n\\\"Running ATest::test_something_a()\\\"\\n\";\r\n\r\n        self::assertTrue(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static function handleError(\r\n        int $errno,\r\n        string $errstr,\r\n        string $errfile = '',\r\n        int $errline = 0,\r\n        array $errcontext = [],\r\n    ): void {\r\n        print \"This won't be called\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` php\r\n<?php\r\n// BTest.php\r\n\r\nuse PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase;\r\n\r\nclass BTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    public static function test_something_b(): void\r\n    {\r\n        print \"\\n\\\"Running BTest::test_something_b()\\\"\\n\";\r\n\r\n        self::assertTrue(true);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) Run the tests with the `--filter=xxx` option, so that it includes ATest:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter=test_something\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe tests should run without the exception being thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Observations\r\n\r\nThese are the steps leading up to the exception being thrown:\r\n\r\n1) `PHPUnit\\Runner\\Filter\\NameFilterIterator:75` generates (a suppressed) PHP warning *\"preg_match(): Delimiter must not be alphanumeric, backslash, or NUL\"*\r\n2) `PHPUnit\\Runner\\ErrorHandler:71` handles this warning, and calls `PHPUnit\\Event\\Code\\TestMethodBuilder::fromCallStack()`\r\n3) The exception is triggered by `PHPUnit\\Event\\Code\\TestMethodBuilder:62` when it isn't able to find a `TestCase` class in the PHP stack trace.\r\n\r\nChanges that cause the exception to ***not*** occur:\r\n- Changing the order of ATest and BTest (by renaming them), or\r\n- Removing BTest, or\r\n- Running phpunit with `--filter=xxx` that doesn't include ATest, or\r\n- Running phpunit *without* the `--filter=xxx` option\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem to occur with `phpunit` ^9.0.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>⚙️ As requested,  here is the `composer info` output</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ composer info |

self::assertTrue(true);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` php\r\n<?php\r\n// BTest.php\r\n\r\n//use Orchestra\\Testbench\\TestCase as TestCase;\r\nuse PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase;\r\n\r\nclass BTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    public static function test_something_b(): void\r\n    {\r\n        dump('running BTest::test_something_b');\r\n        self::assertTrue(true);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) Run the tests with the `--filter=xxx` option, so that it includes the first test:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter=test_something\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe tests should run without the exception being thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Observations\r\n\r\nAlthough `orchestra/testbench` is used to trigger the error,  it seems to be related to the way PHPUnit handles a PHP warning that Testbench generates.\r\n\r\nThese are the steps leading up to the exception being thrown:\r\n\r\n1) Testbench generates PHP warning: *\"file_get_contents(/var/www/html/code-distortion/phpunit-bug/vendor/orchestra/testbench-core/laravel/.env): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory\"*\r\n2) `PHPUnit\\Runner\\ErrorHandler:71` handles this warning, and calls `PHPUnit\\Event\\Code\\TestMethodBuilder::fromCallStack()`\r\n3) The exception is triggered by `PHPUnit\\Event\\Code\\TestMethodBuilder:62` when it isn't able to find a `TestCase` class in the PHP stack trace.\r\n\r\nChanges that cause the exception to ***not*** occur:\r\n- Changing the order of ATest and BTest (by renaming them), or\r\n- Updating ATest to extend from `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase`, or\r\n- Removing BTest, or\r\n- Running phpunit with `--filter=xxx` that doesn't include the first test, or\r\n- Running phpunit *without* the `--filter=xxx` option\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem to occur with earlier versions,  when either `orchestra/testbench` ^7.0, or `phpunit` ^9.0 is used.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>⚙️ As requested,  here is the `composer info` output</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ composer info | sort\r\nbrick/math                         0.11.0
