The only way to configure phpunit behavior is to provide a \"XML Configuration File\" - one big issue is that command line switches wins against xml options. \n\nE.g.: netbeans runs phpunit by using the command line switch \"--log-junit\". At the moment there is no way in netbeans to add the \"--verbose\" switch. In the xml configuration file there is no separate xml element to make phpunit to be verbose. The only way is to use this:\n`<logging>\n  <log type=\"junit\" target=\"/tmp/logfile.xml\" logIncompleteSkipped=\"true\"/>\n</logging>`\nBut this xml element is igored by phpunit when \"--log-junit\" command line switch is given.  \n\nSolution:\na) add an independent xml element (verbose) to supplement the \"--log-junit\" command line switch\nb) add a \"force\" attribute to each xml element to determ if a xml option should override a command line switch (to invert default override behavior)\n\nTo me solution a would be better, because i don´t know at what path netbeans expects the result xml. Maybe you implement both to make phpunit more flexible. \n\nYes indeed a change to the code of netbeans can solve this issue, too. But we all know how long to wait to have a feature request implemented in closed souce software... And i think this is not an issue specific to netbeans, there are probably other programs out there calling phpunit by hardcoded command line switches. \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
