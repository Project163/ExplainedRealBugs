In particular, it does not contain the fix for PHP-Parser 5 compatibility in https://github.com/phpDocumentor/TypeResolver/pull/197, which is part of 1.7.4. This caused a good bit of confusion over in https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/issues/981, because an error was only reproducible with the phpunit phar release, but not the composer dev dependency.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to update this dependency? It's not really obvious to me how this version is determined, because the composer.lock in the phar doesn't seem to match https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/9.6/composer.lock at all (that one does not contain phpdocumentor/type-resolver in the first place).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5712/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5712/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
