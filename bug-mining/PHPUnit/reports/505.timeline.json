Right now, the logic there has:\r\n* Any method `@covers` annotations returns true\r\n* Any class `@coversNothing` returns false\r\n* Else return true\r\n\r\nAs a result, `@coversNothing` will still call `start()` on the coverage driver for test methods defining `@coversNothing`. You're correct in that it doesn't start the driver for a class annotation.\r\nFor methods it is started, but is later ignored during the filter stage.\r\n\r\nI also notice that the test for that function (tests/unit/Framework/TestResultTest.php::testCanSkipCoverage) seems to be inverted.\r\nUnless I'm missing something, it is calling `TestResult::isAnyCoverageRequired($test)` and expecting the result to be the opposite - i.e. the variable is named `$canSkipCoverage` and the test seems to concur with the naming. The test is expecting `CoverageNothingTest` to return `true` to coverage being required, whil
