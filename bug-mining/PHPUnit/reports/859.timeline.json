here to report the same as I noticed this on two different repos today. @sebastianbergmann Can this issue please be re-opened ?\r\n\r\n> I dig a bit the issue and it appears that I used the @ symbol to silence the warnings from functions like mkdir and unlink. So for some reasons, warnings raised by these \"silenced\" functions are detected by Testdox, but not by the default output.\r\n\r\nI can confirm this. **IF** the error silencing operator is being used (either in the code under test or the test itself) **AND** a deprecation/notice/warning is being raised (and silenced), the warning icon appears.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the test is then marked with `#[WithoutErrorHandler]`, the icon disappears (but adding this attribute may not be without consequence).\r\n\r\nI've also found another situation which triggers the appearance of the warning icon, where IMO it is inappropriate:\r\nWhen `expectUserDeprecationMessage()` is called in a test, with or without the `#[IgnoreDeprecations]` attribute (makes no difference).\r\n\r\nI've set up a relatively simple reproduction scenario, which can be checked-out here: https://github.com/jrfnl/bug-report-reproduction-scenarios/tree/phpunit/5884-demo-code\r\n\r\nThe different output of the reproduction scenarios on PHPUnit 9/10/11 can also be seen in the GH Actions workflow output: https://github.com/jrfnl/bug-report-reproduction-scenarios/actions/runs/10672517439\r\n\r\n[Edit]: What I find most confusing about these warning symbols, is - as @Bilge has also pointed out - that there is seemingly no explanation for the appearance of the symbols (in the test output) and you have to go digging to find this issue to figure out why they appear.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/2325263758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jrfnl","id":663378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl","html_url":"https://github.com/jrfnl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14106964853,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAbWLc6OAB7YzwAAAANI1zN1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/14106964853","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-02T20:11:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14106964856,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAbWLc6OAB7YzwAAAANI1zN4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/14106964856","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-02T20:11:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14106986913,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAbWLc6OAB7YzwAAAANI14mh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/14106986913","actor":{"login":"Bilge","id":470626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDYyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge","html_url":"https://github.com/Bilge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bilge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-02T20:17:02Z","performed_via_g
