PHPUnit 9, it was possible to get a non-zero exit code from phpunit if any tests encountered a warning, notice, or deprecation (with the proper configuration). This was very helpful for strictly prohibiting all error events.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the distinction between test _outcomes_ and test _issues_ in PHPUnit 10, but I find myself missing the option for the process to return a non-zero exit code when there are any issues. This is still possible for warnings with `failOnWarning`, but it appears that no such option exists for notices or deprecations. Perhaps it would make sense to have boolean options `failOnNotice` and `failOnDeprecation` to fill this role? (This would also provide parity with the new `displayDetailsOnTestsThatTrigger*` options.)\r\n\r\nIf this functionality already exists, but I just missed it, my apologies! Thanks for all the work on PHPUnit 10. I'm very excited to start using it (especially for the code coverage color/css options, as a colorblind person).","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5196/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
