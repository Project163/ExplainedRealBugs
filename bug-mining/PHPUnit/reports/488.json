Q                   | A\r\n| --------------------| ---------------\r\n| PHPUnit version     | 7.5.2\r\n| PHP version         | 7.2.14\r\n| Installation Method | PHAR\r\n\r\nIn WordPress project, a lot of tests include a [`@ticket` annotation with a numeric ticket ID](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/writing-phpunit-tests/#annotations), for example:\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * @ticket 21117\r\n */\r\n```\r\nA test with this annotation could previously be executed by running `phpunit --group 21117`.\r\n\r\nThis no longer works in PHPUnit 7.2+ due to a strict `in_array()` check introduced in 39294df.\r\n\r\n`phpunit list-groups` does include `21117`, however running `phpunit --group 21117` results in a `No tests executed!` message.\r\n\r\nThe [documentation for `@group`](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/7.4/annotations.html#group) has an example of `@group bug2204`, but it does not say that group cannot be numeric, so I'm assuming a numeric group is still valid.\r\n\r\nLooking at `GroupFilterIterator::__construct()`, `$group` is an integer there, however `$groups` is an array of strings, so `in_array($group, $groups, true)` returns false.\r\n\r\nCould we either cast `$group` to a string or remove the strict check?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3502/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
