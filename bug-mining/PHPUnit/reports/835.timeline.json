also encountered this problem today while running a large test suite in PHPUnit 10.5.7. It occurred in two runs in a row. On the first run, it caused two tests to fail; on the second run, an entirely different single test failed. I run my test suite very frequently and have never seen this before. I have just updated to PHPUnit 10.5.10 to see if that makes a difference. So far, everything seems to be passing, but that could be coincidence.

I am not mentioning them here to blame them, but rather to ask them for help. Maybe to them it's obvious what is going on here, to me it is unfortunately not. I already struggle with the fact that `hrtime()` is used instead of `hrtime(true)`, resulting in the fact that both seconds and nanoseconds have to be dealt with for calculating the

just spent some time looking into this.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot yet say why the described error occurs, I can shed some light as to why we - as in @localheinz  and me - decided to use the `array` type.\r\n\r\nThis is from the php documentation on `hrtime`:\r\n\r\n> Returns an array of integers in the form [seconds, nanoseconds], if the parameter as_number is false. Otherwise the nanoseconds are returned as int (64bit platforms) or float (32bit platforms). Returns false on failure. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how relevant 32bit platforms (still?) are, but a change in return type is not acceptable imho. And having `int|float` as type declaration for everything feels broken. \r\n\r\nWe thus opted for using the stable type `array`, and do the extra effort on calculating.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of calculating: I can see how, logically, `$seconds` could easily become negative in our duration calculation. But for that to happen, the value for `$start` indeed has to be smaller and the exception is, from our business logic's perspective, correct. There is no way a duration could be negative in our world.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it happens anyhow means that we're apparently feeding it the wrong start time reference somewhere.\r\n\r\nI'm at a loss though, how that can be the case - particularly given it only happens sometimes and cannot be reliably be reproduced.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1943326768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"theseer","id":111333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer","html_url":"https://github.com/theseer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11798652766,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAbWLc57oUU1zwAAAAK_QSde","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/11798652766","actor":{"login":"localheinz","id":605483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQ4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz","html_url":"https://github.com/localheinz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-14T08:56:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11798652777,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAbWLc57oUU1zwAAAAK_QSdp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/11798652777","actor":{"login":"localheinz","id":605483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQ4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz","html_url":"https://github.com/localheinz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localheinz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-14T08:56:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1943337286","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5652#issuecomment-1943337286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5652","id":1943337286,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbWLc5z1PlG","user":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_eve
