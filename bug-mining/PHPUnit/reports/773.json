Q                   | A\r\n| --------------------| ---------------\r\n| PHPUnit version     | 10.3.5\r\n| PHP version         | 8.2.8\r\n| Installation Method | Composer\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\nI'm upgrading to version 10 and ran across a relatively minor, but still valid issue. We're running unit tests in a Docker container, in Jenkins, which is not allocating a TTY. This causes phpUnit to revert to the default width of 80 columns, even though we can safely display >200 in our environment.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nphpUnit assumes that a non-interactive TTY always has a width of 80 columns, even though this is rarely the case nowadays. In our case we could safely increase that number to over 200 columns and with a few thousand tests our current output is unnecessarily long.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nDefine `columns=\"200\"` in `phpunit.xml` and run the tests inside a non-TTY environment (e.g., `docker exec container-name phpunit`). You will notice that the output width is limited to just 80 characters, as `Console::isInteractive()` returns `80`.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe ability to define the maximum console width, with 80 being the default. Ideally, via a configuration setting, but it could be also a property that can be changed by an extension.\r\n\r\nI can see a possible workaround by leveraging the `loadFrom()` method that does not override the values, but that's just an ugly hack, not addressing the actual issue.","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
