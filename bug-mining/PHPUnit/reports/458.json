I don't know exactly which version I was running before. Now that I have updated it, I get this warning\r\n\r\n```\r\nPHPUnit 7.3.1 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\r\n\r\n  Warning - The configuration file did not pass validation!\r\n  The following problems have been detected:\r\n\r\n  Line 21:\r\n  - Element 'directory': This element is not expected. Expected is ( file ).\r\n\r\n  Test results may not be as expected.\r\n```\r\nWith my long unchanged phpunit.xml. (From standard Laravel 5.6)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<filter>\r\n        <whitelist processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist=\"true\">\r\n            <directory suffix=\".php\">./app</directory>\r\n            <exclude>\r\n                <file>./app/Http/routes.php</file>\r\n                <directory>./app/Exceptions</directory>  <-- This is line 21 in my phpunit.xml\r\n                <directory>./app/Providers</directory>\r\n            </exclude>\r\n        </whitelist>\r\n    </filter>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything works fine, but the warning is quite annoying. So I tried to fix it. I checked if the way to exclude directory was different. Apparently, from the latest doc, it hasn't changed. So I started to mess around with my config. It ended up that moving the nodes around made the warning disappear.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<whitelist processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist=\"true\">\r\n            <directory suffix=\".php\">./app</directory>\r\n            <exclude>\r\n                <directory>./app/Exceptions</directory>\r\n                <directory>./app/Providers</directory>\r\n                <file>./app/Http/routes.php</file>\r\n            </exclude>\r\n        </whitelist>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't really know if this is bug or a validation rule. But as far as I know, usually the order of nodes in an XML file should not be relevant. So I am posting this here to validate if it is a bug or validation rule?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
