have phpunit 3.7. installed from PEAR to test a symfony 2.0 project on a CI server. With a recent `pear upgrade-all`, the test runs broke, and I get exceptions from Symfony YAML component when it tried to load my `app/config.yml`. The exceptions themselves are a manifestation of https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/7274, so this is a bug in Symfony, but there is a larger issue here, which is that the fact that phpunit loads Symfony components in their latest version (i.e. 2.2), they \"shadow\" the components that belong to the system under test. \n\nSo even if the aforementioned Symfony bug would be fixed, my tests would still run with an inconsistent set of components (everything that phpunit requires is at 2.2, everything else my application requires is at 2.0). So I was just wondering: Is there a way around this, short of downgrading the PEAR packages to older versions?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/14873057","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/860#issuecomment-14873057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/860","id":14873057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODczMDU3","user":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-13T22:34:43Z","updated_at":"2013-03-13T22:34:59Z","body":"Another way to solve the dependency issues is to relax the version requirements and do some sort of version juggling inside PHPUnit.
