Q                   | A\r\n| --------------------| ---------------\r\n| PHPUnit version     | 10.0.7\r\n| PHP version         | 8.1.15\r\n| Installation Method | Composer\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\nIn PHPUnit 9 and older, it was possible to override `TestCase::onNotSuccessfulTest` to change the outcome of a test, as this method was called *before* determining the test status based on the caught exception (and this method could throw a different one that would be used).\r\nIn PHPUnit 10, this method is called *after* determining the test status, which voids any use case I know for that extension point.\r\n\r\nExamples of usage of that method:\r\n\r\n- the Mink shared driver testsuite uses it so that an exception marking that a driver does not support that action automatically marks the test as skipped rather than failed or errored: https://github.com/minkphp/driver-testsuite/blob/b6e69945ceb2ec92bf88fa4a04cea92f2e086eab/tests/TestCase.php#L74-L81\r\n- https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3271214 show cases where they convert an exception to an AssertionFailedError (which would be better solved by https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5201 once available)\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\n<!-- What is the current (buggy) behavior? -->\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a TestCase with a test throwing an exception\r\n2. Override the `onNotSuccessfulTest` method in that TestCase to call `self::markTestSkipped()` when that exception happened\r\n3. Run those tests both with PHPUnit 9 and 10 and compare the difference.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!-- What was the expected (correct) behavior?

trying to create an extension for PHPUnit 10 that runs immediately after the test is executed.\r\nhttps://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/ddf1b957bd90342cecdaec56f62e98d410187cd9/src/Framework/TestCase.php#L623\r\n\r\nCurrently, only `PostConditionFinished` can be used for this. But this only works when the TestCase has an `assertPostConditions` method. When that method is not defined, it will never call `PostConditionFinished`.\r\n\r\nI want to be able to do extra assertions for a library that I'm working on. I don't want to require a trait or abstract TestCase that sets up this `assertPostConditions` method. \r\n\r\nWhen the assertions fail in my extension, they let the test fail, which is exactly what I want.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of running the extension immediately after `runTest()` is that any exception thrown by the extension, will be caught by this try/catch block:\r\nhttps://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/ddf1b957bd90342cecdaec56f62e98d410187cd9/src/Framework/TestCase.php#L602-L628\r\n\r\nAnother solution could be to introduce a new Event that would allow an extension to fail the test after the test was passed.

to be able to upgrade PHPUnit to v10 these blockers need to be resolved:\r\n- [x] PHPUnit 10.1 is required (because of [this](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5201))\r\n- [x] PHPUnitGoodPractices/*\r\n  - ⚠️ ~[BLOCKER](#issuecomment-1675400947)~\r\n  - dropped usage in #7362 & #7363\r\n- [x] phpspec/phpspec#1446 (replacement of ~~phpspec/phpspec#1444~~)\r\n- [x] phpspec/prophecy-phpunit#45\r\n- [ ] phpspec/prophecy#599 (support for `sebastian/recursion-context` v5 required)\r\n- [ ] Allow `phpunit/phpunit` >=10.1 in `composer.json`\r\n- [ ] Update codebase to be compatible with [10.x release](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/main/ChangeLog-10.0.md#1000---2023-02-03), while keeping compatibility with 9.x (v10 requires PHP 8.1 while we
