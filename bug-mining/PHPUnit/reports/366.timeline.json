its _own_ output buffers should be considered risky, but code that empties all output buffers seems pretty reasonable to me.\n\nE.g. 1: A framework wants to collect output to build a formal Response object.\nE.g. 2: `TestCase::stopOutputBuffering()` empties all buffers, why is it just OK for PHPUnit to do it? ;)\n\nIf you're amenable to the idea I can send a
