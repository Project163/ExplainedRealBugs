of PHPUnit is a bit special: it is only necessary for the `--testdox` output. Using a different output (the default one for instance) does not need it.\r\n\r\nWe were relying on that in the scssphp project to run a CI job with mbstring disabled, to ensure that our library was still compatible with runtimes that don't have mbstring (using `--ignore-platform-req=mbstring` in Composer to skip this requirement), which was working fine on older versions.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to change the `mbstring` to happen only if the testdox output is used instead ?
