enough, I was already pondering if and how to detect what migration to run. Given that the XSD reference hasn't been around from the beginning and is technically optional, we do not really have a means to tell if a migration is needed and/or from what version. Correct?\r\n\r\nI didn't actually check when and where things changed over time. I presume that there might be more changes coming for upcoming versions of PHPUnit. Are we caring about these?\r\n\r\nYour skeleton code suggests that we \"only\" support migrating from 9.2 to 9.3, but doesn't yet tell on how to decide if any migration is needed. I take it that'll be your problem to solve? ;-)\r\n\r\nI might be overthinking / over engineering this, but my initial design in my fork started with coming up with a flexible migration stack where based on the \"incoming\" version a list of migrations might be performed. \r\n\r\nI also laid out various smaller migrations, so they can be run independently. Not sure yet, if that'll work since some things got moved around but i'll give it another go probably tomorrow evening.\r\n\r\n
