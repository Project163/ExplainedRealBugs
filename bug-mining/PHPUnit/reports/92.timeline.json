Uninstalling DbUnit got rid of the error message for me, but is clearly not the proper solution. I did some more digging and discovered an older version of `Symfony\\Component\\Yaml\\Dumper` in my application's include path (it was distributed with Doctrine). I removed that version of the YAML dumper from my app's include path, re-installed DbUnit, and the error message is gone. It seems that this error was caused by my muddled include path and is not the fault of PHPUnit (or DbUnit), so I'm closing this issue.
