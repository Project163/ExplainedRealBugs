everyone. \n\nThanks for looking into this. Our usage only tests against one php version so the hack works for us but again, it's very unreliable.\n\nI'm sorry I can't help much with narrowing down the examples because I'm not familiar with how watchr and ant launch/execute those commands. I'll see what I can find.\n\nOne possible workaround I'm thinking that is rather ugly is to pass the php bin path to phpunit directly as an argument. Like:\n\n```\n$ phpunit --php_bin=/usr/bin/php tests\n```\n\nLike I said: ugly. :(\n\nP.S.\n\n@dzuelke, I've upvoted the phph bug report.
