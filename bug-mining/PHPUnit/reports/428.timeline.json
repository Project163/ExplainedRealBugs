issues like this, you can use http://php.net/manual/en/reflectionclass.getfilename.php to get the filename of a class to see if it's coming from vendor or from a phar

I have big issue with phpunit. The fact that we don't require and treat it as a dependency of our project seems to mean that as soon as we require a library the phpunit phar also bundles, test can fuck up in unexpected ways. It is the case in [this PR](https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataAdminBundle/pull/4029) since I required `matthiasnoback/symfony-dependency-injection-test` to test the Sonata Admin Symfony extension (which was not covered at all, it seems, by the way). My last commit, where I require and use phpunit provided by Composer fixes this issue. [Here is what I get otherwise](phpDocumentor/ReflectionDocBlock#80). This way of doing things has caused issues in the past, and will probably cause more if we continue like this. Can we agree that this is no longer relevant? As an argument against this, doing things like that also makes the travis workflow unnecessarily complicated IMO.\nAnd finally, [we were warned against this by Jordi himself](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2014#issuecomment-166712695), and I really think we should listen to what this guy has to say.\n\nRelated issues (each one has been very time-consuming) : \n- https://github.com/matthiasnoback/SymfonyDependencyInjectionTest/issues/48\n-

problem.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/255141256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ssnikiforov","id":20687133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg3MTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20687133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov","html_url":"https://github.com/ssnikiforov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssnikiforov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":830785603,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODMwNzg1NjAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/830785603","actor":{"login":"iplus","id":2189037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2189037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus","html_url":"https://github.com/iplus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-20T15:35:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":830785604,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDgzMDc4NTYwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/830785604","actor":{"login":"iplus","id":2189037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2189037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus","html_url":"https://github.com/iplus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iplus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-20T15:35:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/256688808","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2015#issuecomment-256688808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2015","id":256688808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjY4ODgwOA==","user":{"login":"COil","id":177844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil","html_url":"https://github.com/COil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T16:00:28Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T16:06:20Z","body":"@ssnikiforov

I was updated my symfony projects to 3.2 version which contains some changes in Yaml component: It's now can handle PHP constants in code and class `Symfony\\Component\\Yaml\\Yaml` have new constant `PARSE_CONSTANT`.\r\nWhen I ran tests with globally installed phpunit I got error `Error: Undefined class constant 'PARSE_CONSTANT'` in `/tmp/test/vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Loader/YamlFileLoader.php:396`\r\nI add some debug to this line:\r\n```php\r\nif (!defined(Yaml::class.'PARSE_CONSTANT')) {\r\n    $rc = new \\ReflectionClass(Yaml::class);\r\n    var_dump($rc->getFileName());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd got string `phar:///usr/local/Cellar/phpunit/5.6.2/libexec/phpunit-5.6.2.phar/symfony/yaml/Yaml.php` what means that class `Symfony\\Component\\Yaml\\Yaml` was loaded from phpunit's phar, and not from my `vendor` directory.\r\n\r\nI've tried to reproduce this with clean symfony's 3.2 installation with [default phpunit.xml](https://gist.github.com/sc0rp10/e0df52e98f3b28de6ebbf2a7e0e080a2) and got same error.\r\n\r\nI created repository with clean symfony 3.2 and this bug: https://github.com/sc0rp10/phpunit-symfony-issue\r\nClone it, install vendors and run globally installed `phpunit` (my version is 5.6.2).\r\n\r\nIs it PHPUnit issue or
