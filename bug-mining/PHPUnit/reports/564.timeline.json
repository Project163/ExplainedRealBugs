Slim\\Tests\\MiddlewareDispatcherTest::testResolveThrowsExceptionWithoutContainerAndUnresolvableClass\r\nexpectExceptionMessageRegExp() is deprecated in PHPUnit 8 and will be removed in PHPUnit 9.\r\n\r\n2) Slim\\Tests\\MiddlewareDispatcherTest::testResolveThrowsExceptionWithoutContainerNonAdvancedCallableResolverAndUnresolvableClass\r\nexpectExceptionMessageRegExp() is deprecated in PHPUnit 8 and will be removed in PHPUnit 9.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt doesn't appear that there's an intended replacement for the deprecated method. \r\n\r\nThere are two potential approaches to handle this that I can think of:\r\n\r\n1. Wrap the method call that results in the exception being thrown in a `try` block and handling the regular expression match check in the corresponding `catch` block using a different assertion method (e.g. `assertSame(1, preg_match('...', $exception->getMessage()))`).\r\n2. Switch to using `expectExceptionMessage()`, which checks that the exception message contains a specified substring, and have it check for the common part of the substring expressed by the existing regular expression.\r\n\r\nThoughts? I'd be happy to submit a PR for this myself if I know the preferred approach.\r\n\r\nUpdated: Currently blocked by sebastianbergmann/phpunit#4142,
