But that's inapplicable, for three reasons:\n1. Private properties of TestCase are not in the visible scope and thus will not be serialized.   In any case, user-space tests should not be aware of PHPUnit's internals.\n2. Custom test base classes may cater for themselves, but every subclass would have to manually cater for its own properties all over again.\n3. The class instances are still unserialized into the parent process environment (which, meanwhile, is the most problematic aspect from my perspective).\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/50084427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sun","id":41992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun","html_url":"https://github.com/sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/50091215","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1351#issuecomment-50091215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1351","id":50091215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDkxMjE1","user":{"login":"sun","id":41992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun","html_url":"https://github.com/sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-24T23:24:04Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T23:24:04Z","body":"Started work on a PR.  Regression test fails cleanly.  Getting rid of the test class instance is trivial.  Getting rid of the exception is a bit more tricky, because `ResultPrinter::printDefectTrace()` expects a fully functional Exception stack + stacktrace.  Not sure how to resolve that yet, but I'll study further.  Ideas/pointers would be appreciated.\n\nThe proposed solution also appears to be the proper, belated fix for #74 — which introduced [`PHPUnit_Util_PHP::getException()`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/src/Util/PHP.php#L217).  That extraneous measure only exists, because we're trying to re-instantiate arbitrary classes of the child process in the parent process.  A `__PHP_Incomplete_Class` can only exist in the parent process.  Otherwise the child process would exit with a fatal error already.\n\nAs a result, I'm fairly sure that this is the root cause for many other issues.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/50091215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sun","id":41992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun","html_url":"https://github.com/sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/50098587","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1351#issuecomment-50098587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1351","id":50098587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDk4NTg3","user":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T01:25:38Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T01:25:38Z","body":"> Upfront: Sorry, folks - I'm aware that I'm currently littering the queue with bug reports & fixes for functionality that isn't fully supported (e.g., process isolation) and for platforms that many people don't really care about (e.g., Windows)… :wink:\n\nNo need to be sorry.

The `TestFailure` now only contains the test name string (instead of full class instance) + the thrown exception, but without the original stack trace.  Instead, we only serialize a cleaned copy of the stack trace (without `args`).\n\nThis makes the regression test pass + fixes some fatal errors in my tests already.  However, it only works for assertion failures, but not when a test throws an exception.  I'll see whether moving the code into the base `PHPUnit_Framework_Exception` class helps to resolve that.\n\nLastly, `Serializable` only exists since PHP 5.4.0.
