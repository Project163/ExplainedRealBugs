only one specific test

is this an issue related to #10.\n\nWith the current way of running the tests the filtering isn't applied before TestSuite.php executes the setup.\n\nWith a big test suite and a phpunit.xml what should work is using directory based filtering with `phpunit tests/module/stuff` but for example for the phpbb3 test suite that doesn't work out so there are cases where `--filter` is the only option.\n\nThe only idea i have to work around this is to lazy initialize your stuff in the first call to `setUp` but thats rather hackish.\n\nI'm quite sure that this will be taken care of by #10 but if you need this sooner and the patch is rather small/manageable this might get into PHPUnit 3.7 (Not 3.6.x as it breaks bc). \n\nThe workaround by tarjei works as the code is in `setUp` and the self:: could just as well be `self::$setupBeforeFirstTestCase`
