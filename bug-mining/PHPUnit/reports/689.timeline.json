has been discussed in #4141 and #4142.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** The dependency on Prophecy has been removed for PHPUnit 10. Anything related to out-of-the-box support for Prophecy is deprecated since [PHPUnit 9.1](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/9.1.0/ChangeLog-9.1.md).\r\n\r\nIf we remove the dependency on `phpspec/prophecy` in the `composer.json` of PHPUnit 8.5 and PHPUnit 9.5, then PHPUnit would continue to work as-is for any developer who does not use Prophecy (through `TestCase::prophesize()`).\r\n\r\nFor developers who use `TestCase::prophesize()` in their tests, PHPUnit will stop to work unexpectedly. If they add a dependency on `phpspec/prophecy` in the `composer.json` of their project then their tests should work again.\r\n\r\nOf course, we should be able to detect in `TestCase::prophesize()` whether Prophecy is available and trigger an error with a descriptive message (\"Please add a dependency on phpspec/prophecy to your composer.json\").\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not know what to do here. If we do not do anything, PHPUnit 8.5 and PHPUnit 9.5 cannot be installed without hassle until [Prophecy allows PHP 8.2 in their `composer.json`](https://github.com/phpspec/prophecy/issues/556). And PHP 8.3 next year, and so on. If we drop the dependency on Prophecy for PHPUnit 8.5 and PHPUnit 9.5, even with a nice error message, then we break the tests for everyone who uses `TestCase::prophesize()`, and in a bugfix release, no

PHPUnit 9.5.23, for instance, with these changes then\r\n\r\n* PHPUnit would not pull in Prophecy and can therefore be installed without workaround on PHP 8.2\r\n* nothing would change for developers
