When it fails (an assertion), it emits `PHPUnit\\Event\\Test\\Failed`. However, PHPT tests do not follow suit; they do correctly emit the `Failed` event, but the `Passed` event is not so emitted. They _do_ emit `AssertionSucceeded`, but as this is marked `@deprecated`, one supposes one cannot rely on this (and it is removed in v11).\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nPHPT tests do not emit the `PHPUnit\\Event\\Test\\Passed` event when they pass.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nWrite PHPT test with `--EXPECTF--` section that passes.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`PHPUnit\\Event\\Test\\Passed` event is emitted.","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5898/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
