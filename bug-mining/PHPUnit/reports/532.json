`assertArraySubset()` method is a constant source of confusion and frustration. For example, see #2069, #2108, #2568, #3101, #3234, #3240, or #3319.\r\n\r\nI have come to the conclusion that this mess cannot be fixed without breaking backward compatibility. In addition to that, I myself have yet to see a use case for this or how this would be used then. I have also not seen this used in the wild.\r\n\r\nThis is why I decided to deprecate `assertArraySubset()` in PHPUnit 8 and to remove it in PHPUnit 9. Anybody who thinks this functionality is useful is more than welcome to take the code, put it into a separate project, and package it as an extension for PHPUnit.","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3495/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":1,"-1":16,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
