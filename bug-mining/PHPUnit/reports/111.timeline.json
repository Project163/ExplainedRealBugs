(or danke) for the reply. Sorry to bother, but I'm glad the fault is somewhere at my side. \n\nI'm feeling a newBee and very uncomfortable on windows system (originally being a Unix guy).\n\nI can not follow your solution. Should I add something to the PATH variable? and what is the bin-dir?\nI install xampp for having a php.exe and the libraries on my system.  Only things I add to xampp before installing phpunit was xdebug and changing php.ini for both xdebug and composer (via openssl).\nI hoped that magically xampp was updated so that phpunit and the libraries could be detected.\n\nI also understand from your email that the post? in github was not the right place. I would be more 'lucky' if I dropped my question at '#phpunit irc channel' Is this at freenode? I can not find it. \ndo you have a link to this channel or to the supporting website? \n\nJacob\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Volker Dusch [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: Mon 12/10/2012 9:09 PM\nTo: sebastianbergmann/phpunit\nCc: jpbunschoten@kpnmail.nl\nSubject: Re: [phpunit] PHP/CodeCoverage/Filter.php not found; using composer on Windows (#737)\n\nIf you do a system wide install using composer your call should resolve to that bin-dir directory (if you added it to PATH) and not to anything xampp.\n\nI've reinstalled the recent PHPUnit version from composer and a clean install works for me on windows.\n\nI'm sorry to say it but you will have more luck taking your issue to the #phpunit irc channel or asking on Stackoverflow as we are not able to provide installation (and especially xampp support as that has a lot of quirks) on the bug tracker due to time constraints and available folks.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/737#issuecomment-11215123\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/11218578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jpbunschoten","id":491477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MTQ3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/491477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten","html_url":"https://github.com/jpbunschoten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbunschoten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
