isolation tests display errors so they can be handled by the test runner.\n\nTo expand on the issue a little: one of the reasons to run tests in isolation is to test fatal errors (see [Tests/TextUI/fatal-isolation.phpt](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/00f34086f6cdd9d9d5b1c6a3009c59dce783e4dc/Tests/TextUI/fatal-isolation.phpt)). Unfortunately, error printing can be disabled in `php.ini` which will hide the errors from the test runner (see #710). \n\nA pull request (#778) was accepted today that hides the notice described in #710, but it doesn't solve the underlying problem. In fact, your tests will appear to pass when they should fail (albeit for a different reason). If you set `display_errors=Off` in your `php.ini` and run [Tests/TextUI/fatal-isolation.phpt](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/00f34086f6cdd9d9d5b1c6a3009c59dce783e4dc/Tests/TextUI/fatal-isolation.phpt), you can see this in action.\n\nThis PR should fix the problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/12191105","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/710#issuecomment-12191105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/710","id":12191105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTkxMTA1","user":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-13T08:40:36Z","updated_at":"2013-01-13T08:40:36Z","body":"I think this can be closed now.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/12191105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":34222315,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQyMjIzMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/34222315","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-01-13T08:51:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
