As suggested, I ran the test in a separated process, and it worked when running with phpunit installed by composer in the vendor/bin directory. \n\nBUT, it does not work when ran with a phpunit PHAR archive, the \"headers\" still sent, after some digging, I found that it is the first shebang line \"#!/usr/bin/env php\" in the stup.php that causes this trouble. \n\nIf the PHAR is loaded as a library by 'require', the shebang line is absolutely unnecessary.\n\nOR,  fix this by calling 'ob_start()' within the https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/src/Util/PHP/Template/TestCaseMethod.tpl.dist just before the loading of the phar archive, but this is not the way it should be done.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
