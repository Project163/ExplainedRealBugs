Mock a class.\r\n2. Make an invocation rule with `atMost(1)` for example, but do not call the mocked method from the tested unit.\r\n3. Run the test.\r\n\r\nMy example call:\r\n```PHP\r\n$this->storesRepository->expects(self::atMost(1))\r\n  ->method('findOneBy')\r\n  ->with(['name' => $storeName])\r\n  ->willReturn($storeEntityWithSameName);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTest passes as zero calls is smaller then the value passed to the `atMost(...)` invocation rule.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
