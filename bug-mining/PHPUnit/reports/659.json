Consider the following test:\n\n```\n<?php\nclass AClass implements Serializable {\n    public function serialize() { return serialize('abc'); }\n    public function unserialize($data) {}\n}\n\n$GLOBALS['A'] = new AClass;\n\nclass ATest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase\n{\n    public function testTrue()\n    {\n        $this->assertTrue(true);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRunning this test with the `--process-isolation` flag will raise the following error:\n\n```\n$ phpunit --process-isolation ATest.php \nPHPUnit 3.5.0RC2 by Sebastian Bergmann.\n\nE\n\nTime: 0 seconds, Memory: 5.25Mb\n\nThere was 1 error:\n\n1) ATest::testTrue\nRuntimeException: PHP Warning:  Class __PHP_Incomplete_Class has no unserializer in - on line 79\nPHP Stack trace:\nPHP   1. {main}() -:0\nPHP   2. unserialize() -:79\n\n\nFAILURES!\nTests: 1, Assertions: 0, Errors: 1.\n```\n\nThis happens because http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/PHPUnit/Framework/Process/TestCaseMethod.tpl.dist processes globals before it processes included files.  For objects that implement the `Serializable` interface this will not work as the class declaration is needed before the object can be unserialized.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
