this is done by wrapping the `exec` in a \"SystemCommand\" class and that classes is tested using runkit/test-helpers/just tested by doing an echo command.\n\nWhat you are proposing would be changing the systems $PATH and creating some stub files there.\n\nIt definitely sounds interesting (not sure If its really useful but it's always hard for me to guess how people are using phpunit) but it sounds like a **lot** of work to get right.\n\nIt should work on all three major platforms, work with pipes (which is doable ofc) and it would require a folder that is writeable by phpunit on a disk that isn't mounted `noexec` so it would have to do quite a lot of environment checks.\n\nJust my initial

thanks and of course a SystemCommand class - itself tested against a known executable - is the quickest way to resolve this. The lower level approach I thought of might still be interesting but I'd already figured it would take a fair bit of effort hence checking in here before doing anything. \n\nIf I get a quiet moment I may revisit this but for the time being I'll probably just use a wrapper class for my current project.\n\nNot sure if you want to leave this open but unscheduled or close it out?
