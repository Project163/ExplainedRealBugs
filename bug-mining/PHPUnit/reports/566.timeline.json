not sure whether or not this very method or its implementation are the best way to solve the use case it at least for me did cover.\r\n\r\nBut the general use case is actually rather simple, given that the definition of \"equal\" with XML documents isn't exactly clear:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\r\n<root>\r\n    <node />\r\n</root>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ./.\r\n\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\r\n<root><node /></root>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre these equal?\r\n\r\nIf you parse an XML document into a DOM and compare the resulting object graph, they won't be because of additional DOMText-Elements representing the whitespaces for the indentation and the line breaks in the first XML.\r\n\r\nIn many (most?) contexts though, the whitespace is actually pretty irrelevant. So how would one assert that two structures are \"otherwise\" equal?\r\n\r\nMaybe the method name doesn't (didn't) really transport that intention, but that's what at least I have been using it for.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/718954257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"theseer","id":111333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer","html_url":"https://github.com/theseer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/718957933","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4091#issuecomment-718957933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4091","id":718957933,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODk1NzkzMw==","user":{"login":"theseer","id":111333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer","html_url":"https://github.com/theseer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theseer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T19:01:27Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T19:01:27Z","body":"Another example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\r\n<root a=\"true\" b=\"true\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ./.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\r\n<root b=\"true\" a=\"true\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nLogically (semantically?), the two XML structures are equal.

PR **adds support for PHP 8.0** and **drops support for PHP 7.0**.\r\n\r\n## PhpUnit version\r\nThe most problematic issue was to choose PhpUnit version:\r\n\r\n- PHP 8.0 allows PhpUnit >=8.5.12 or >= 9.3.\r\n- PhpUnit 7 and above requires `setUp(): void` and `tearDown(): void` syntax.\r\n\r\nSo to have a code compliant to both PHP 7.x and 8.0, we need **PhpUnit >= 7**.\r\nPhpUnit 7 requires PHP >= 7.1.\r\n**We need to drop support of PHP 7.0.**\r\n\r\nPhpUnit 8 deprecates the following assertion method:\r\n- expectExceptionMessageRegExp => expectExceptionMessageMatches\r\nWe can check for the existence of expectExceptionMessageMatches and fall back to expectExceptionMessageRegExp.\r\n\r\nPhpUnit 9 deprecates several assertion methods that we use, for example:\r\n- assertFileNotExists => assertFileDoesNotExist\r\n- assertEqualXMLStructure (see https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4091)\r\nThe latter is not yet replaced by any method in PhpUnit version 9.\r\nPhpUnit 9 also requires to drop support of PHP versions 7.1 and 7.2.\r\n\r\nWe decide to stick to **PhpUnit < 9.0**.\r\n- PHP 7.1  will use PhpUnit 7.x\r\n- PHP > 7.1 will use PhpUnit 8.x.\r\n\r\n## PhpUnit related changes:\r\n\r\n- PhpUnit 7 requires changing `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase` with  `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase` and adding `void` return type for `setUp` and `tearDown`.\r\n- PhpUnit 7 requires that every test performs at least one assertion. We just added a dummy assertion to avoid this limit. Also, some data provider methods have names beginning with “test”, making them seen as tests. Removing the `test` prefix solved the problem.\r\n- PhpUnit 7 is less permissive about value conversions in assertEquals than previous versions. For example, in PhpUnit before version 7.0, the following assertion passes, while it fails in PhpUnit 7 and later:\r\n`$this->assertEquals('1.0', '1');`\r\n\r\n## PHP 8 related changes:\r\n\r\n- PHP 8 introduces a new reserved word: `match`. The QTI “match” operator was previously represented by a class named `Match`. Its name is replaced with `MatchOperator`.\r\n- PHP 8 throws an error when an unknown format is provided to `sprintf` method. Previously, it just returned a string with the invalid format specifier removed. A workaround is added to keep this behavior in PHP 8 and ensure no breaking change hurts the user experience

As you really check for identical documentElements a viable function name could be `assertIdenticalDOM` or `assertIdenticalDOMTree`. What do you think?\r\n\r\nMy current use case is that I deserialize XML from a message queue into a PHP Object and then serialize the object back to XML and the output should have the identical parent-child relationship and the elements should have the same attributes. In my case the values are not important. For example it's possible that the Date formats are different. But the elements and attributes should be the same.\r\n\r\nSo I think a general function which would be helpful would be a function which can:\r\n1. Check if only parent-child tree is identical\r\n2. Check that all attribute keys are the same\r\n3. Check if all attribute keys and attribute values are the same\r\n4. Check if element values are the same\r\n\r\nBy default I think 1 should always be checked, and the others are incremental.\r\n\r\nSo maybe a bitmask could be used.
