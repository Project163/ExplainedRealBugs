This leads to static analysis issues.\n\n\n#### Current behavior\n\nWhen using PHPStan in a project where `with()` is used with an array (not a list), this may lead to a static analysis error (although the keys are ignored anyways):\n\n     Method […]\\InvocationMocker::willReturn() invoked with unpacked array with possibly string key, but it's not allowed because of @no-named-arguments.\n\n\n#### How to reproduce\n\n```php\n$input = ['a' => 'foo', 'b' => 'bar'];\n\n$mock->with(...$input); // invalid\n$mock->with(...array_values($input)); // valid\n\n$mock->willReturn(/* … */);\n```\n\n\n#### Expected behavior\n\nBoth cases are a valid usage, so I'd expect there would be no static analysis errors.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/6163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/6163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
