PR introduce a way to start using the Symfony Console component. \nI would like to have your opinions on the implementation and the suggested usage.\n\nThis relates with #1355, \n- The first step of this PR is to define all supported arguments and options\n- The next step would be to transform the `PHPUnit_TextUI_Command` into a Symfony `Command` or `Application`.\n\n**Suggested usage**: \n\nI propose to fetch the arguments in `PHPUnit_TextUI_Command::handleArguments()` using the `Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\ArgvInput`.\nOnce done, we could set the inner attribute `$this->arguments[<option>] = $input->getOption(<option>);` instead of relying on the `PHPUnit_Util_Getopt` class.
