I managed to do it relatively easily by temporarily changing the PATH and creating a simple script that logged the arguments sent and returned the value I wanted. I think this is essentially equivalent to using getMock() to isolate an external library class.\n\nWould you be interested in this as a core addition to PHPUnit? So for example you'd be able to do:\n\n``` php\n$this->getMockCLI('git')\n    ->expects($this->once())\n    ->with('rev-parse HEAD')\n    ->will($this->returnValue('abcdefg'))\n```\n\nIf so, I could try and rough out an implementation for you to review?\n","closed_by":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
