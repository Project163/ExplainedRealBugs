For every of them I created separate test suite (each of them has own phpunit.xml and bootstrap files). Now I would like to be able to run all tests at once, gather end status and coverage report. Additionally I need to have process separation between these test suites. In order to do this I would like to put following tags in master phpunit.xml file:\n\n``` xml\n<testsuites>\n  <testsuite configFile=\"my-plugin/phpunit.xml\" processIsolation=\"true\" />\n  <testsuite configFile=\"other-plugin/phpunit.xml\" processIsolation=\"true\" />\n</testsuites>\n```\n\nCould you implement this?\n","closed_by":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
