of this repository is not used to build `phpunit.phar`. When building the PHAR, additional packages are installed, which results in a modified `composer.lock` file. It is this modified `composer.lock` file that you see when you introspect the PHAR like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-9.6.phar\r\n$ php phpunit-9.6.phar --composer-lock\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor [backward compatibility](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/9.6/test-doubles.html#prophecy), the PHAR build process for PHPUnit 9.6 installs `phpspec/prophecy` with version constraint `^1.12.1`. This depends on `phpdocumentor/reflection-docblock` which in turn depends on `phpdocumentor/type-resolver`.\r\n\r\n> Is it possible to update this dependency?\r\n\r\nI do not know how. Let me explain:\r\n\r\nPHPUnit's `composer.json` file on the `9.6` branch uses\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"config\": {\r\n    \"platform\": {\r\n        \"php\": \"7.3.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nto make sure that no package which requires a version of PHP that is newer than PHP 7.3.0 can be installed regardless of the actual PHP version that is used to build the PHAR, for instance. This leads to version 1.6.1 of `phpdocumentor/type-resolver` to be installed. When I change `\"php\": \"7.3.0\"` to `\"php\": \"8.3.0\"` in the above, then the PHAR build process uses version 1.8.1 of `phpdocumentor/type-resolver`.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that [version 1.6.1 of `phpdocumentor/type-resolver` uses the `\"php\": \"^7.2 || ^8.0\"` version constraint](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/TypeResolver/blob/1.6.1/composer.json#L13) where [version 1.8.1 of `phpdocumentor/type-resolver` uses the `\"php\": \"^7.4 || ^8.0\"` version constraint](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/TypeResolver/blob/1.8.1/composer.json).\r\n\r\nThe only solution for this problem that I can see is a version of `phpdocumentor/type-resolver` that has https://github.com/phpDocumentor/TypeResolver/pull/197 and can be installed with PHP 7.3.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1958812251/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1958835750","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5712#issuecomment-1958835750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5712","id":1958835750,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbWLc50wXYm","user":{"login":"jrfnl","id":663378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl","html_url":"https://github.com/jrfnl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-22T07:11:54Z","updated_at":"2024-02-22T07:11:54Z","body":"@jaapio
