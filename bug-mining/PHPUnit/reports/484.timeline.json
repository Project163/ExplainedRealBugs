project that uses PHPUnit and Psalm, Psalm detects the issue in PHPUnit that cannot be fixed in the project and therefore has to be suppressed.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: InternalMethod - tests/ExampleTest.php:17:12 - The method \r\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Builder\\InvocationMocker::method has been marked as internal \r\n(see https://psalm.dev/175)\r\n        )->method('test');\r\n```\r\nThe above is caused by the interface returning a class marked as `@internal`:\r\n1. https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/7f664ffd558ba68031963f63d3e23a951ba441fc/src/Framework/MockObject/MockObject.php#L24\r\n2.

https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3742#issuecomment-559682132.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php declare(strict_types=1);\r\n\r\nnamespace Test;\r\n\r\nuse PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase;\r\n\r\nclass ExampleTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * @test\r\n     */\r\n    public function testExample() : void\r\n    {\r\n        $t = $this->createMock(T::class);\r\n        $t->expects(\r\n            $this->never()\r\n        )->method('test');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface T\r\n{\r\n    public function test() : void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the full demo project in the [gist](https://gist.github.com/morozov/189e817c9ca8eee4d225f1d3475bc230):\r\n```\r\n$ composer install\r\n$ vendor/bin/psalm\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the project's tests extend and use the PHPUnit test classes, suppressing errors in the `vendor/` directory doesn't help.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPHPUnit doesn't expose the internal parts of its API to the
