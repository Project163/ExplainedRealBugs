I could not find the documented meaning behind this anywhere, and searching the code for that emoji did not yield any results, so I'm assuming it's either a bug or undocumented feature, but either way it is very confusing and was not present in PHPUnit 9.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nTestdox will print warnings next to some tests for no discernable reason whatsoever.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPatreon Link\r\n ✔ Patreon link with Follower·only\r\n ✔ Patreon link with Non-member\r\n ⚠ Patreon link with Tier·2\r\n ✔ Patreon link with Former·patron\r\n ✔ Patreon link with Tier·1\r\n ✔ Patreon link with Cancelled·but·active·member\r\n ⚠ Patreon link with T1·->·T2·upgrade\r\n ⚠ Patreon link with Tier·3\r\n\r\nOK (131 tests, 511 assertions)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/assets/470626/0b94db43-8850-4cca-ac92-ac2b6477b6ad)\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun some tests?\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIf the summary shows 100% OK, I would not expect to see warning icons in the summary output.
