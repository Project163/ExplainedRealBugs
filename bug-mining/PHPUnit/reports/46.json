Below configuration that I use. Removing log type = 'coverage-html causes the lack of both reports, adding it generates both reports correctly.\n\nIf there is no such functionality I ask for adding it.\n\nPlease add \"summary\" report type - generating a complete HTML each time is not needed - a summary of the percentage how much lines of is covered in the code is enough (full html need 2gb of ram :/ and takes forever).\n\nVersion used: 3.5.0 and 3.5.10\n\nBest regards\nGrzegorz\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/135/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
