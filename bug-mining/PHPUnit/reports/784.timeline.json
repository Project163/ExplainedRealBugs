Q                   | A\r\n| --------------------| ---------------\r\n| PHPUnit version     | 10.1.0\r\n| PHP version         | >=8.1\r\n| Installation Method | Composer\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\nIn version `10.1.0` of PHPUnit, a new configuration syntax has been introduced that is not backwards compatible with previous versions. This change was introduced in pull request #5294.\r\n\r\nAnd the PHPUnit configuration migration feature is not working properly. (I've not had time to pinpoint the exact issue)\r\n\r\nWe're seeing, most if not all, PHPUnit-related CI actions failing in @laminas, @mezzio, and our personal repositories.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/laminas/laminas-code/actions/runs/4716480790/jobs/8364248270\r\nhttps://github.com/laminas/laminas-migration/actions/runs/4721162509/jobs/8374119988\r\nhttps://github.com/mezzio/mezzio-problem-details/actions/runs/4716453001/jobs/8364196408\r\nhttps://github.com/mezzio/mezzio-authorization-rbac/actions/runs/4716159258/jobs/8363633788\r\nhttps://github.com/ghostwriter/event-dispatcher/actions/runs/4722678948/jobs/8377614377\r\nhttps://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5294#issuecomment-1506904338\r\nhttps://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5332#issue-1669970642\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nTests fail due to **various** syntax errors in the configuration file.\r\n\r\n```\r\nphpunit.xml.dist:13: element include: Schemas validity error : Element 'include': This element is not expected.\r\nphpunit.xml.dist fails to validate\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nThere was 1 PHPUnit test runner warning:\r\n\r\n1) Test results may not be as expected because the XML configuration file did not pass validation:\r\n\r\n  Line 14:\r\n  - Element 'include': This element is not expected.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTools like `infection/infection` that use PHPUnit under the hood fail:\r\n```\r\nThe file \"/tmp/infection/phpunitConfiguration.initial.infection.xml\" does not pass the XSD schema validation.\r\n[Fatal] Start tag expected, '<' not found in https://schema.phpunit.de/10.0/phpunit.xsd (line 1, col 1)\r\nError: r] Failed to parse the XML resource 'https://schema.phpunit.de/10.0/phpunit.xsd'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMigrating the configuration file fails (not always):\r\n\r\n```\r\nMigration failed: \"./phpunit.xml\" is not a valid PHPUnit XML configuration file that can be migrated\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nMigration failed: \"mezzio-helpers/phpunit.xml.dist\" is not a valid PHPUnit XML configuration file that can be migrated\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Update to the latest minor release (`10.1.x`) of PHPUnit\r\n2. Run PHPUnit\r\n3. Notice one of the various error messages\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n1. Update to the latest minor release (`10.1.x`) of PHPUnit\r\n2. Attempt to run tests using a configuration file in the old syntax\r\n3. Notice a message to migrate the configuration file.\r\n4. Tests should run using the old configuration syntax without issue.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1. Update to the latest minor release (`10.1.x`) of PHPUnit\r\n2. Attempt to run tests using a configuration file in the old syntax\r\n3. Notice a message to migrate the configuration file.\r\n4. Run `phpunit --migrate-configuration`\r\n5. Attempt to run tests using a configuration file in the new syntax\r\n6. Tests should run using the new configuration syntax without issue.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\n - Revert the changes\r\n - Update the PHPUnit documentation to include the new configuration syntax\r\n - Deprecate the old syntax in `10.1`\r\n - Remove the old syntax in `11`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5335/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10644221318,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAbWLc5jZRK0zwAAAAJ6ce2G","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/10644221318","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"6cc85b42b75d6be3c405f1418e9cc75533da7b92","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commits/6cc85b42b75d6be3c405f1418e9cc75533da7b92","created_at":"2023-10-13T13:09:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11830242530,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbWLc5jZRK0zwAAAALBIyzi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/11830242530","actor":{"login":"clxmstaab","id":47448731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ4NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47448731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab","html_url":"https://github.com/clxmstaab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clxmstaab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6cc85b42b75d6be3c405f1418e9cc75533da7b92","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/staabm/phpunit/commits/6cc85b42b75d6be3c405f1418e9cc75533da7b92","created_at":"2024-02-16T15:20:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
