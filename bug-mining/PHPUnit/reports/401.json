executing PHPUnit tests using Jenkins CI and the JUnit output format, all PHPUnit tests are grouped up in a single package (root). This is because Jenkins groups tests into packages by parsing the optional `classname` attribute of `<testcase>` elements, and interpreting it as a fully-qualified name in the form of `packageName.className`. Since PHPUnit only adds a `class` attribute, there is no information available to Jenkins with which it could group tests, which can lead to test results quickly becoming unmanageable given a large enough test set.\r\n\r\nThis is probably as much of a Jenkins CI issue as it is a PHPUnit one, but since Jenkins CI is a relatively popular CI system (and has its own [semi-official PHPUnit template](http://jenkins-php.org/)), I'd like to ask if you guys think this is something worth working on. A `classname` attribute could be generated based on parent testsuite name, file path, or class namespace (if any). I could prepare a PR with one of the above implementations.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and thank you for PHPUnit :)","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
