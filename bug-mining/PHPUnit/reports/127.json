When I installed PHPUnit as a global lib on my box using PEAR, its path was: /usr/share/php/PHPUnit. I had warrnings in my scripts, beacause \"/usr\" directory wasn't in \"open_basedir\". \n\nI don't know why this path:\n\n```\n__DIR__ . '/../../..'\n```\n\nis used, but it's not flexible enough and could force admin to use unsafe settings (giving access for php script to \"/usr\" directory it's not safe. \n\nThe easiest solution is to add \"@\" before \"is_dir\", but it's probalby not very good idea. \n","closed_by":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/889/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
