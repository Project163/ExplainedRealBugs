It happens because of the `fclose` call in the example. After `fclose` the `IsType` matcher's call to `is_resource`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/628bcfbbefa0e47dbb7d773021338590bd7586ee/src/Framework/Constraint/IsType.php#L167-L169) returns false:\n\n``` php\n$fh = fopen(__FILE__, 'r');\nvar_dump(is_resource($fh)); // bool(true)\n\nfclose($fh);\nvar_dump(is_resource($fh)); // bool(false)\n```\n\nSince invocations are verified [after the test is run](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/628bcfbbefa0e47dbb7d773021338590bd7586ee/src/Framework/TestCase.php#L767), the file would have already been closed and `is_resource` would return false.\n\nThe strange `NULL` in the error description comes from the last ditch effort to [export the variable to a string](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/exporter/blob/c7d59948d6e82818e1bdff7cadb6c34710eb7dc0/src/Exporter.php#L191). Since [`is_resource`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/exporter/blob/c7d59948d6e82818e1bdff7cadb6c34710eb7dc0/src/Exporter.php#L114-L120) fails, the fallback is `var_export` which always returns \"NULL\" for resources.\n\n``` php\n$fh = fopen(__FILE__, 'r');\nvar_dump(var_export($fh, true)); // string(4) \"NULL\"\n```\n\nA possible solution here is to use `get_resource_type` as a fallback in the `IsType` matcher. It returns \"Unknown\" for closed resources an `NULL` (with a warning) for all other types:\n\n``` php\n\n$fh = fopen(__FILE__, 'r');\nfclose($fh);\n\nvar_dump(get_resource_type($fh)); // string(7) \"Unknown\"\n\n$types = [\n    'string',\n    true,\n    1,\n    1.0,\n    null,\n    new \\stdClass,\n    [],\n];\n\nforeach ($types as $type) {\n    var_dump(@get_resource_type($type)); // NULL\n}\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/60468261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisguitarguy","id":1010392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1010392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisguitarguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":183598727,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4MzU5ODcyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/183598727","actor":{"login":"chrisguitarguy","id":1010392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1010392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisguitarguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8431d94e9b1fcf94d72da5aae58897b5fb55b221","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisguitarguy/phpunit/commits/8431d94e9b1fcf94d72da5aae58897b5fb55b221","created_at":"2014-10-25T02:14:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chrisguitarguy","id":1010392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1010392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisguitarguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisguitarguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-25T02:14:56Z","updated_at":"2014-10-25T02:14:56Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/pull/1480","id":46799393,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjMzMzQzMDA=","number":1480,"title":"Allow
