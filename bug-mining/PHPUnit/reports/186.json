IMHO it should.\n\nUse case: I have a few very slow tests that I put into a single group (`@group slow`). Normally I do not want to run them, so I put them in the `group/exlude` tag in `phpunit.xml` to ignore them. Sometimes I do want to run them, so I type this on the commandline:\n\n```\nphpunit --group slow\n```\n\nI expect PHPUnit to run all the tests in the `slow` group because commanline options override phpunit.xml options. But in reality, no tests are run. Furthermore, there seems to be no other way to un-exclude a group on the commandline that has been exlcuded in the xml file.\n","closed_by":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
