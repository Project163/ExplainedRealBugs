I chose a class name following the already defined constraints ( `PHPUnit_Framework_Constraint_SpecialMatches`). to verify its correct behavior I also wrote some tests.\nBut when running phpunit to see if the tests verify my implementation correctness I only got the \"Testsuite 'foo' does not contain tests' message. \nAfter some consulting on the latest IPC we found out, that test suites starting with `PHPUnit_` will be recognized in terms of registration to the test runner but its tests are completely ignored. \nAs for a solution I propose to change the error message of this case to something to one describing the fault more clear, like 'The class name of a test suite shall not be prefixed with \"PHPUnit_\" '.  \n","closed_by":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
