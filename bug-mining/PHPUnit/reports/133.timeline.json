Well maybe, but not in a way that makes sense to a user. Basically you're saying to only depend on phpunit-3.7.*, I want to depend on a specific version, like phpunit-3.7.19.\n\nAll I did was require your package \"phpunit-3.7.19\". I tested my project & it worked. I cloned it on another machine a few days later and it stopped working. No one can use phpunit-3.7.19 anymore**. It once worked, it now does not. You're forcing me to upgrade phpunit when I don't want to. There's a few solutions going forward\n- php-code-coverage must adhere to http://semver.org and not break BC due to a \"bugfix\". The changes that caused the --coverage-text to stop working should have been released in a new major version of php-code-coverage, such that users of phpunit-3.7.19 do not get those updates, rendering their installation broken.\n- PHPUnit must state it's dependency on a specific version of php-code-coverage.\n\n*\\* that is, no one can use this particular feature, without fixing the mismatched dependencies it sets up by default.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/18359174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joshribakoff","id":4021306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4021306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff","html_url":"https://github.com/joshribakoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshribakoff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/18360180","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/924#issuecomment-18360180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/924","id":18360180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MzYwMTgw","user":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-23T17:52:34Z","updated_at":"2013-05-23T17:52:34Z","body":"It's
