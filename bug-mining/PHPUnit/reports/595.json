Q                   | A\r\n| --------------------| ---------------\r\n| PHPUnit version     | 9.3.5\r\n| PHP version         | 7.4.9\r\n| Installation Method | Composer\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\nIt seems that the default setting for the `includeUncoveredFiles` attribute in the `<coverage>` element was changed from `true` to `false` even though the `xsd` schema file for 9.3 [says `true` in the `default` attribute](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/13e83c2dfa0326035990d74ae68a51e576a1b4eb/phpunit.xsd#L34).\r\nI noticed it when running the tests on a large codebase and the coverage increased significantly 🙃 \r\n\r\nAt first glance it seems that this was introduced in this commit: https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commit/111f2305b114ec7771dd32ddce5136a4b5387c71#diff-2ca98deb18566460d93ce70e3ad20779R383\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nWhen producing coverage, uncovered files are ignored.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nOmit the `includeUncoveredFiles` attribute in the `coverage` element and run a testsuite which doesn't cover all files.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhe omitting the attribute, it should default to `true`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4417/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
