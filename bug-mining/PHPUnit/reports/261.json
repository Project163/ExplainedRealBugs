I am so used to this, that I made the following mistake already twice :frowning: \n\nusing\n`phpunit --config foo.xml`\ninstead of\n`phpunit --configuration|-c foo.xml`\n\nSince this didn't throw any kind of error or warning message on the cli, it took me quite some time (longer than I care to admit) to figure out the source of the problem.\n\nWould this be considered a bug fix or a feature (since behaviour change is introduced)?\n\nOr am I missing some obvious explanation due to why phpunit behaves like this?\n\nIf I could get hinted the right direction, I would be happy to start a PR on this.\n\nso long,\nTobias\n","closed_by":{"login":"whatthejeff","id":306525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/306525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff","html_url":"https://github.com/whatthejeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whatthejeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
