This means that for all skipped tests those objects are not cleaned up.\n\nCode:\n\nFrom [PHPUnit/Framework/TestCase.php#L816](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/PHPUnit/Framework/TestCase.php#L816)\n\n``` php\n        try {\n            if ($this->inIsolation) {\n                $this->setUpBeforeClass();\n            }\n\n            $this->setExpectedExceptionFromAnnotation();\n            $this->setUp();\n            $this->checkRequirements();\n            $this->assertPreConditions();\n            $this->testResult = $this->runTest();\n            $this->verifyMockObjects();\n```\n\n[and in `vertifyMockObjects`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/PHPUnit/Framework/TestCase.php#L1049) the cleanup happens\n\n`$this->mockObjects = array();`\n\nif and exception is thrown that call to `vertify` never happens and the objects don't get cleaned up.\n\nAdding a `$this->mockObjects = array();` after the catch blocks might be a easy way to solve this but i wanted to ask about it before doing anything.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/656/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
