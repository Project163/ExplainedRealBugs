Laravel Version: 5.4.18\r\n- PHP Version: 7.1.4\r\n- Database Driver & Version: MySQL (not related)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nI was trying to override a .env config value that can either be true or false. While staying within the application everything works just fine. So for my PHPUnit test runs, i want to \"hardcode\" this value using the env-configuration in my phpunit.xml (just like it's possible for APP_ENV etc.).\r\nBut it seems, that the value somehow gets badly parsed (when my env is set to \"true\" it results in being \"1\" within the application, \"false\" results in \"\").\r\nI found an issue at the phpunit-project: https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2331.\r\nI don't know if this has something to to with the problem I described, but as this has been closed a while ago, i'm unsure how to go on.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\nAdd a .env config (i.e. ACTIVATE_FEATURE_X=true). When you want to override it for your phpunit environment, add it in phpunit.xml (phpunit->php is the xml path where to add it):\r\n`<env name=\"ACTIVATE_FEATURE_X\" value=\"false\"/>`\r\n\r\nNow, when you run tests and request env('ACTIVATE_FEATURE_X') it returns \"\", but should return false. When you set ACTIVATE_FEATURE_X to true in phpunit.xml it returns \"1\".\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/18822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/18822/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/560020439","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2331#issuecomment-560020439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2331","id":560020439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDAyMDQzOQ==","user":{"login":"hackel","id":583677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzY3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/583677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel","html_url":"https://github.com/hackel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-30T20:54:39Z","updated_at":"2019-11-30T20:54:39Z","body":"This fix was reverted due to BC concerns, but the change was never bumped up to a new major release.

the bug**\r\nI'm trying this package in our application to see if it will add any value for us. We have an extensive test suite, with lots of functional tests that hit the database. After installing this package the total runtime for the whole suite increased by approx. 30%. We use https://github.com/liuggio/fastest to speed up our tests, installing this package increases runtime on 8 cores from a little under 2 minutes to a little over 3 minutes on my computer. If using just PHPUnit the time increases from about 13 to about 17 minutes. (Hence the need for fastest)\r\n\r\nAs we're not really interested in the activity log for our test suite we tried to disable it by setting the `ACTIVITY_LOGGER_ENABLED` variable to false in testing. ~~I can see that this disabled logging, but it did nothing to the total runtime of our testsuite, the package still does its thing, it's only the actual insert into the database that seems to be disabled.~~ (edit: this was mistaken, because of the parallel execution of fastest which uses a number of databases combined with running tests in transactions I missed that setting `ACTIVITY_LOGGER_ENABLED` to false actually did nothing at all)\r\n\r\nIf I disable the package by adding the line `activity()->disableLogging();` to a ServiceProvider the test runtime is back to normal.\r\n\r\nI expected the environmental variable to do the same thing. I'm not quite sure if this is a bug report or a feature request, but I would like to avoid an environment check in a service provider to enable/disable this package if possible. \r\n\r\nOh and while I expected this package to slow us down a bit I was surprised by the 30% runtime increase, but I'm not sure if anything can be done about that..  \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nRun a testsuite with `ACTIVITY_LOGGER_ENABLED` false, then run it again with `activity()->disableLogging();`, observe difference in runtime\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSetting `ACTIVITY_LOGGER_ENABLED` to false should disable the package. \r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n- PHP: 7.4.11\r\n- Database: MySQL 5.7\r\n- Laravel: 8.x\r\n- PHPUnit 9.4.2\r\n- Package: 3.16","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spatie/laravel-activitylog/issues/807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spatie/laravel-activitylog/issues/807/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/924866508","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2331#issuecomment-924866508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2331","id":924866508,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbWLc43IFfM","user":{"login":"vsjoshtait","id":87642073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjQyMDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87642073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait","html_url":"https://github.com/vsjoshtait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsjoshtait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-22T12:06:09Z","updated_at":"2021-09-22T12:06:56Z","body":"For those finding this issue currently, I created a workaround like so:\r\n```xml\r\n        <env name=\"AUTHORISATION_ENABLED\" value=\"0\" force=\"true\" />\r\n```\r\nThen converted the value like so:\r\n```php\r\n$enabled = env('AUTHORISATION_ENABLED', true);\r\n\r\nif ($enabled === '0') {\r\n    $enabled = false;\r\n} elseif ($enabled === '1') {\r\n    $enabled = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn 'enabled' => $enabled;\r\n```\r\nI needed a custom configuration setting in a Laravel application derived from an environment variable.
