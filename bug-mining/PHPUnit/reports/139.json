As far as I could find, there is no way to make sure that `testA()` runs first without overriding it.\n\nIf instead, inherited tests are executed first, dependencies such as the one above would work. I believe this change in ordering should have no averse effects. \n\nOrder shouldn't matter except for the dependencies given and it makes no sense to have a test from the parent depend on one from the child, so this change in order shouldn't change which tests fail and which do not. The only other side effect should be a change in order of the output, but I'd say this actually puts things in a better order. (Basically, if there are dependencies but they aren't declared to PHPUnit, the more \"relevant\" failure will be shown.)\n\nIn summary: I propose inherited tests are run before tests defined in the child class, so you can define dependencies between the two.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/945/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
