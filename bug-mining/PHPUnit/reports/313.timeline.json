The code in that method is becoming quite nasty. Yanking it out and putting it into a separate class would also make it easier to test. \n\nAnyone got any pointers or suggestions as to whether or not this would be appreciated?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/62321207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Potherca","id":195757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/195757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca","html_url":"https://github.com/Potherca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Potherca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/144912139","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1436#issuecomment-144912139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1436","id":144912139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDkxMjEzOQ==","user":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:10:28Z","updated_at":"2015-10-02T04:10:28Z","body":"Dear contributor,\n\nlet me start by apologizing for not commenting and/or working on the issue you have reported or merging the pull request you have sent sooner.\n\nPHPUnit 5.0 was released today. And today I am closing all open bug reports and pull requests for PHPUnit and its dependencies that I maintain. Please do not interpret the closing of this ticket as an insult or a lack of interest in your problem. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nIf the topic of this ticket is still relevant then please open a new ticket or send a new pull request. If your ticket or pull request is about a defect then please check whether the issue still exists in PHPUnit 4.8 (which will received bug fixes until August 2016). If your ticket or pull request is about a new feature then please port your patch PHPUnit 5.0 before sending a new pull request.\n\nI hope that today's extreme backlog grooming will allow me to respond to bug reports and pull requests in a more timely manner in the future.\n\nThank you for your understanding,\nSebastian\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/144912139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":424915560,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI0OTE1NTYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/424915560","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:10:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":424915573,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50NDI0OTE1NTcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/424915573","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:10:30Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
