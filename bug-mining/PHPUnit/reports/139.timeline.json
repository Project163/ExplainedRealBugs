It can also be the opposite, as in your example. In summary, I disagree with your claim that \"it makes no sense to have a test from the parent depend on one from the child\". Nonetheless, there is an explicit dependency that PHPUnit fails to handle properly and that is a bug.\n\nI'm currently struggling with a similar bug with inheritance between testcases, although I have a concrete (i.e. not an abstract) baseclass. Ignoring the fact that this inheritance in and of itself is usually a nono, PHPUnit doesn't handle this properly.\n\nBTW: Which version were you using?

just stumbled across a pair of bugs with PHPUnit. For those who prefer code, I have prepared a small test repository, see link below. The setup where I found the bugs initially was using PHPUnit 3.7 and had two concrete testcases, PureFooTest and FooTest, where the latter was derived from the former. Note that I'm aware that creating a common baseclass for both would generally be preferable, but let's ignore that for now.\n\nThere are two issues at work here:\n1. When DerivedTest extends BaseTest, it works. When AnotherDerivedTest extends BaseTest, the baseclass is not found. The difference seems to be the lexical ordering, A is loaded before B but D is loaded after B.\n2. When using `require_once \"BaseTest.php\";` as a workaround, BaseTest is no longer recognized as standalone testcase! I can only muse about how PHPUnit implements test discovery, but I guess this is related to the first point.\n\nThe behaviour changed between PHPUnit 3.7.38 and 4.3.5. The newer version gets the test discovery right, but it still fails the autoloading, making the \"require_once\" workaround necessary. Maybe changing the autoloading setup could make a difference, too, but I haven't investigated this possibility.\n\nRelated:\n- #364 : phpUnit won't see some classes with tests\n- #366 : The requirement of having one test class per source file is not properly enforced\n- #945 :  Dependency on inherited test \n- https://github.com/UlrichEckhardt/phpunit-bug, see branches phpunit4.3 and phpunit3.7\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1499/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/144912457","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/945#issuecomment-144912457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/945","id":144912457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDkxMjQ1Nw==","user":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:15:27Z","updated_at":"2015-10-02T04:15:27Z","body":"Dear contributor,\n\nlet me start by apologizing for not commenting and/or working on the issue you have reported or merging the pull request you have sent sooner.\n\nPHPUnit 5.0 was released today.

Please do not interpret the closing of this ticket as an insult or a lack of interest in your problem. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nIf the topic of this ticket is still relevant then please open a new ticket or send a new pull request. If your ticket or pull request is about a defect then please check whether the issue still exists in PHPUnit 4.8 (which will received bug fixes until August 2016). If your ticket or pull request is about a new feature then please port your patch PHPUnit 5.0 before sending a new pull request.\n\nI hope that today's extreme backlog grooming will allow me to respond to bug reports and pull requests in a more timely manner in the future.\n\nThank you for your understanding,\nSebastian\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/144912457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":424916977,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI0OTE2OTc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/424916977","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:15:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":424916985,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50NDI0OTE2OTg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/424916985","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:15:28Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
