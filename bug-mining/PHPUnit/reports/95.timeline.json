I wasn't aware that many folks run tests like \"phpunit class.php\" anyways as most of what I'm seeing is people using the phpunit.xml and filters.\n\nApart from that the change seems to cause more issues than it's worth and if @sebastianbergmann agrees I'd just remove it again.\n\nPassing custom paramers to phpunit via cli args might be a ugly hack but using _ENV isn't all that much nicer. Until we have something build in that can be a nice replacement i guess it's ok to not break that :)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/8768639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":25142720,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxNDI3MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/25142720","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-09-21T15:38:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":25142721,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTQyNzIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/25142721","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-09-21T15:38:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/8768976","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/655#issuecomment-8768976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/655","id":8768976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Njg5NzY=","user":{"login":"tmysik","id":331924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTkyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/331924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik","html_url":"https://github.com/tmysik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t

want to run some Selenium tests with PHPUnit. For this, I need to know what browser and what base-URL to use inside my tests. Since I boot-up phpunit with my own CLI runner wrapper script, I wanted to do something like this:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n\ndefine('PHPUnit_MAIN_METHOD', 'PHPUnit_TextUI_Command::main');\n\n// gotta love Composer...\n$loader = require __DIR__.'/../src/vendor/autoload.php';\n$loader->add('', __DIR__.'/../tests/unit');\n\n// get custom CLI params\n$opts = getopt('', array(...));\n\n// define constants based on the params\ndefine('MYPROJECT_TEST_BASE_URL', ...);\n\n// hide options\nunset($_SERVER['argv'][5]);\n\n// run PHPUNit\nPHPUnit_TextUI_Command::main();\n```\n\nUnfortunately, PHPUnit does not allow any other paramters that its own. The \"PHPUnit-way\" would be to use `<php>` sections inside the XML config files (I use XML config files, by the way) to define env variables. But this would make me have a ton of config files (Firefox + http://domainA/, Firefox + Domain B, Chrome + Domain A, Chrome + Domain B, etc.)\n\nI understand the reasoning behind not allowing unknown options. But it should be possible to allow all options starting with `--custom-` (or something like that). This would make the CLI runner much more useful and still be relatively safe against typos and deprecated/removed options.\n\nCurrently, as a extremely ugly hack, I remove my elements from `$_SERVER['argv']` to make PHPUnit work, but I would like to remove this hack some time in the future.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something from the docs about how to run PHPUnit with custom options?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/9100222","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/655#issuecomment-9100222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/655","id":9100222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxMDAyMjI=","user":{"login":"rukbat","id":1436767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzY3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1436767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat","html_url":"https://github.com/rukbat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rukbat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-03T09:18:33Z","updated_at":"2012-10-03T09:18:33Z","body":"Hi,
