@morozov,\r\n\r\nWhat you probably didn't notice in this test is that you are creating 3 invoke mocks. \r\n1 accepts a call at position 0\r\n2 accepts a call at position 1\r\n3 forcing exactly 2 calls. \r\n\r\n1 and 2 are called once. number 3 is called twice as you would expect. However if the latter would give you a return value that you expect things are getting unreliable. That's why the warning was introduced. In the linked test there is also a check on the arguments. which makes this situation even worse in combination with return types. \r\n\r\nThe best solution I know ATM is use \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass TestTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    public function testMatchers() : void\r\n    {\r\n        $mock = $this->createMock(T::class);\r\n        $mock->expects(self::exactly(2))\r\n            ->method('test')->withConsecutive(\r\n                 ['call_1_argument1'],\r\n                 ['call_2_argument1'],\r\n        )\r\n\r\n        $mock->test();\r\n        $mock->test();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your example, the call to `at()` doesn't make any sense. The sequence doesn't matter in this situation. \r\n\r\nI do need to check if this is also the case for the linked doctrine test. Which seems a bit more complicated. I might have overlooked a scenario. However, I doubt if this is really testing what you are expecting it to test. Which was not the case in the example you gave. \r\n\r\nI will come back to you when I found out more.

It seems that I overlooked a scenario :-( which makes my patch completely invalid for this scenario. When I created the patch I didn't realize that there was a stranger `at()` in the matchers. The whole implementation was modified most likely with the introduction of `at()` back in 2006. Causing al kind of strange behavior on the existing mock invoke matchers. The `at()` expectation is the only matcher that works with the multiple matches. \r\n\r\nThe code below works with phpunit 9.1 but doesn't with the PR I submitted. \r\n```\r\n        $mock = $this->getMockBuilder(\\stdClass::class)\r\n            ->addMethods(['foo'])\r\n            ->getMock();\r\n\r\n        $mock->expects($this->at(0))\r\n            ->method('foo')\r\n            ->with('bar')\r\n            ->willReturn('1');\r\n\r\n        $mock->expects($this->at(1))\r\n            ->method('foo')\r\n            ->with('foo')\r\n            ->willReturn('2');\r\n\r\n        $mock->expects($this->exactly(2))->method('foo');\r\n\r\n        self::assertSame('1', $mock->foo('bar'));\r\n        self::assertSame('2', $mock->foo('foo'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a BC break. Which was undetected until now. \r\n\r\nAt first, it looked like a quick win to make the mocks more reliable. If I had more time I would suggest deprecating the `at()` modifier. In favor of a better solution to ensure the order of calls. But I do bearly have enough time at the moment to work on my own open-source projects. So I won't be able to build a new mechanism to cover this case. \r\n\r\nBesides that, I would like to make a statement to the users of `at()`. There is a big warning in the docs of phpunit that you are coupling your test to strict to the actual implementation. Seen the implementation of mocks in phpunit I would highly recommend avoiding the usage of this matcher. \r\nYou might get used to the way phpunit behaves with test doubles. But this modifier is an edge case. Al kind of constructions you are building with `at()` can not work without it. Your test will be a mess when you are going to refactor things. Or when more test doubles are introduced. Since `at()` is counting ALL test doubles. \r\n\r\nLong story short, we should revert the patch of #4258 or accept this BC break.

behaviour of `at()` is confusing. Using `at()` leads to brittle tests at best and lying tests at worst. The documentation even states:\r\n\r\n> The `$index` parameter for the `at()` matcher refers to the index, starting at zero, in all method invocations for a given mock object. Exercise caution when using this matcher as it can lead to brittle tests which are too closely tied to specific implementation details.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the implementation of `at()` impedes improvements to other aspects of the test doubles support in PHPUnit, see https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4291#issuecomment-644947020 for example.\r\n\r\nWe should therefore deprecate\r\n\r\n* `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase::at()` (as well as the `PHPUnit\\Framework\\at()` wrapper)\r\n* `PHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Rule\\InvokedAtIndex`\r\n\r\nin PHPUnit 9 and [remove](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4298) it in PHPUnit 10.\r\n\r\nIf we realize that a mechanism for specifying the order in which expected invocations occur then, and only then, shall we think about how to best implement this. A replacement for `at()` is explicitly outside the scope of this deprecation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4297/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":6,"-1":4,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/645167772","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4291#issuecomment-645167772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4291","id":645167772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTE2Nzc3Mg==","user":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-17T05:54:50Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T05:54:50Z","body":"@jaapio
