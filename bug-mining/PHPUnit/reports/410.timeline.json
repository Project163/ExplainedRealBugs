It works for easy test suites with simple, independent test methods. It somehow fails with `@depends` connected tests or data providers.\n\nWhat I'd do: Have your test suite run one more time in full. It can produce a test result file which includes test execution time. You can then take this as the basis for splitting tests into groups by assigning each executed test class to an execution group 1, 2, 3, 4... Parallel execution would run each group explicitly, and run another job with all groups excluded to catch newly added tests.\n\nThe more manual step would be to split your test suite into distinct blocks: Unit tests should never do any kind of I/O and be fast. Integration tests will do some kind of I/O and be slow - maybe there's more than one individual topic that is tested and might be a reason to split the slow tests again.\n\nOne other thing: You haven't reported a bug with PHPUnit, so it isn't really the right place to discuss using an outdated version here. I think you should at least close this ticket. A good idea is to ask this kind of question on StackOverflow with the `phpunit` tag.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/163965138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SvenRtbg","id":416600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/416600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg","html_url":"https://github.com/SvenRtbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRtbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/164310042","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1993#issuecomment-164310042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1993","id":164310042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDMxMDA0Mg==","user":{"login":"ioleo","id":1419884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTk4ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo","html_url":"https://github.com/ioleo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioleo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-13T23:23:17Z","updated_at":"2015-12-13T23:25:55Z","body":"Yes, I am useing [liuggio/fastest](https://github.com/liuggio/fastest).
