Summary\r\n\r\nWe read about the changes in PHPUnit 10 and the removal of `withConsecutive()` + its alternatives (https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4564 and https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4026), so starting with a  smooth upgrade path for our projects by upgrading to PHPUnit 9.6 first seemed like a logical step. We expected to see deprecation warnings for `withConsecutive()`, as they have been deprecated in https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5063. After running the test suite with 9.6.3, there was no output to inform us about any deprecation, so it seems to me that there are no warnings for this method implemented yet, but I think there should be.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in your thoughts on this. \r\n\r\nBtw, thanks for all the work you put into PHPUnit
