is a feature that -- in a perfect world, at least -- nobody needs. When you write clean object-oriented code there is no global state that you need to backup before and restore after each test. The PHPUnit code base would be less complex and easier to maintain if this feature were gone.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/22016369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/22016454","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/923#issuecomment-22016454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/923","id":22016454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDE2NDU0","user":{"login":"ghorvath","id":988993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODk5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/988993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath","html_url":"https://github.com/ghorvath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghorvath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-02T16:17:33Z","updated_at":"2013-08-02T16:17:33Z","body":"That's what I thought.

contributor,\n\nlet me start by apologizing for not commenting and/or working on the issue you have reported or merging the pull request you have sent sooner.\n\nPHPUnit 5.0 was released today. And today I am closing all open bug reports and pull requests for PHPUnit and its dependencies that I maintain. Please do not interpret the closing of this ticket as an insult or a lack of interest in your problem. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nIf the topic of this ticket is still relevant then please open a new ticket or send a new pull request. If your ticket or pull request is about a defect then please check whether the issue still exists in PHPUnit 4.8 (which will received bug fixes until August 2016). If your ticket or pull request is about a new feature then please port your patch PHPUnit 5.0 before sending a new pull request.\n\nI hope that today's extreme backlog grooming will allow me to respond to bug reports and pull requests in a more timely manner in the future.\n\nThank you for your understanding,\nSebastian\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/144912472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":424917024,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI0OTE3MDI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/424917024","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:15:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":424917034,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50NDI0OTE3MDM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/424917034","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:15:38Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
