@sebastianbergmann \r\n\r\nI realize that you have your release process that you tend to stick to, but can these issues with removing support for the old configuration format be postponed for PHPUnit 11? Or, maybe better (since PHPUnit 8 is still actively supported), maybe implement a forward compatibility layer in 8.x to ease the migration?\r\n\r\nThe practical issue with our project is that PHPUnit 9(.3) does not support PHP 7.2, so we're stuck on PHPUnit 8 when testing on 7.2, which means that we are unable to use the new configuration format, and thus need to maintain two sets of configuration. Multiply this by the sheer number of repositories we have for the project, and things pretty much start to get out of hand. I know that PHP 7.2 will be EOLed soon, but sometimes clients do not care.\r\n\r\nChanging the entire configuration format out of the blue without some kind of forward compatibility layer in older versions, or sufficient time to migrate will definitely put strain on the community and efficient use of PHPUnit.\r\n\r\nThanks!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/647995014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"emodric","id":362286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/362286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric","html_url":"https://github.com/emodric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emodric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3471789467,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQ3MTc4OTQ2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/3471789467","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-23T08:32:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3471789469,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0NzE3ODk0Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/3471789469","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-23T08:32:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/648007827","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4279#issuecomment-648007827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4279","id":648007827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODAwNzgyNw==","user":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/
