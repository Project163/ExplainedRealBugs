for commenting on a closed issue, but I’m trying to wrap my head around the language deprecations and your view on how they should affect consumer projects (and their users).\n\nPHP 8.2 has security support until 31 Dec 2026, which means there will still be users on PHP 8.2 until then. As a library author, I want to continue supporting 8.2 during this period, since I don’t want to force users to upgrade their PHP version—that decision isn’t mine to make.\n\nWhen PHPUnit dropped support for 8.2, my libraries had to drop support for 8.2 as well in order to use newer versions of PHPUnit. But as mentioned, I still want to support my user base. This means I can’t use PHPUnit 12 until PHP 8.2 is out of security support.\n\nShouldn’t PHPUnit drop support for PHP versions only after they are no longer security-supported? That way, libraries could benefit from the latest features in PHPUnit without needing to upgrade their own minimum PHP requirements prematurely.\n\nI’d really appreciate your thoughts on this. Thank you so much for everything you do for the community.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/2767504732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexSkrypnyk","id":378794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODc5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/378794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSkrypnyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17064491845,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAbWLc6ZGg83zwAAAAP5H3tF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/17064491845","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-31T21:55:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17064491853,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAbWLc6ZGg83zwAAAAP5H3tN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/17064491853","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-31T21:55:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/2768046796","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5978#issuecomment-2768046796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5978","id":2768046796,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbWLc6k_QrM","user":{"login":"kubawerlos","id":9282069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODIwNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9282069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubawerlos","html_url":"https://github.com/kubawerlos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubawerlos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubawerlos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubawerlos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubawerlos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubawerlos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubawerlos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubawerlos/repos","events_url":"ht
