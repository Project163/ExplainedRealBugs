I should note that the original issue happens because the test uses:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->mockedClass->expects( $this->never() )->method( $this->anythingBut( 'method1', 'method2' ) );\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `anythingBut` is defined as\r\n\r\n```php\r\nprotected function anythingBut( ...$values ) {\r\n    return $this->logicalNot( $this->logicalOr(\r\n        ...array_map( [ $this, 'identicalTo' ], $values )\r\n    ) );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhoever wrote this code didn't think of __destruct being defined in the mocked class. So the issue reported here happens as a side effect. This is why I said that reporting a violated soft assertion for __destruct might be fine, but is not needed for my use case.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/824093624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daimona","id":38216014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjE2MDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38216014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona","html_url":"https://github.com/Daimona","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/824094349","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4656#issuecomment-824094349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4656","id":824094349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDA5NDM0OQ==","user":{"login":"Daimona","id":38216014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjE2MDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38216014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona","html_url":"https://github.com/Daimona","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daimona/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-21T14:12:39Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T14:12:39Z","body":"Also,
