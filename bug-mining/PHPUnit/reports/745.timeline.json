major functional changes from 9.5 to 10.0 are:\r\n\r\n* Annotations are converted to attributes.\r\n* Data providers must now be static.\r\n\r\nMany data provider functions are converted to `TestWith` attributes. These are safer now as attributes, because they can contain real PHP objects (previously they had to be a JSON representation). When the data sets are trivial, this is much simpler and more compact.\r\n\r\nPHPUnit no longer returns non-zero exit code on notices/deprecations, though they will still be printed in the results due to the use of the `displayDetailsOnTestsThatTrigger*` settings. For more info, see: https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5196\r\n\r\nAll tests are upgraded using the PHPUNIT_100 rector ruleset. It didn't work perfectly, so some manual fixes were necessary.\r\n\r\nAdd custom CSS for phpunit HTML code coverage. This uses dark-mode and colorblind-friendly colors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smrealms/smr/issues/1551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smrealms/smr/issues/1551/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8494145936,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbWLc5eIpF6zwAAAAH6SmGQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/8494145936","actor":{"login":"hemberger","id":846186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NjE4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/846186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger","html_url":"https://github.com/hemberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"813af89ffbfb2b4d8da914bffc939f6ea42e1531","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hemberger/smr/commits/813af89ffbfb2b4d8da914bffc939f6ea42e1531","created_at":"2023-02-10T22:08:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8494288123,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbWLc5eIpF6zwAAAAH6TIz7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/8494288123","actor":{"login":"hemberger","id":846186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NjE4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/846186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger","html_url":"https://github.com/hemberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cd79787e3f0e759b83f1e3ea49fe764d27252211","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smrealms/smr/commits/cd79787e3f0e759b83f1e3ea49fe764d27252211","created_at":"2023-02-10T22:36:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1429884937","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5196#issuecomment-1429884937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5196","id":1429884937,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbWLc5VOlAJ","user":{"login":"stof","id":439401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTQwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof","html_url":"https://github.com/stof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T15:00:29Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T15:00:29Z","body":"While I understand the logic for deprecations, I would still appreciate an option to fail on notices.

v10 changed how it handles notices, warnings, errors and\r\ndeprecations. Therefore, converting them to exception has been\r\nremoved in favour of display/fail options per type. Recently, the\r\nlast missing piece for notices and deprecation has been added with:\r\n\r\n  #5196: Optionally (fail|stop) on (notice|deprecation) events\r\n\r\nPHPUnit v9 (and eventually earlier versions) did not converted\r\nsuppressed error levels to exceptions, if the corresponded old\r\nand removed option has been set. With PHPUnit v10, only native\r\nphp error level (notices/strict,warnings,deprecated) are not\r\nhandled if suppressed using the \"@\" suppress operator or by\r\nerror_reporting() configuration.\r\n\r\nUser error levels (notices,warnings,deprecation,error) are no\r\nlonger suppressable.\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to have only one defined set, which should be\r\nsuppressable AND suppressed state regonized to suite all needs\r\nfor framework, packages and applications using PHPUnit to test\r\nthings. This **must** be configurable for users of the PHPUnit.\r\n\r\nTherefore, adding configuration options to the xml configuration,\r\nwhich controls the behavior in the `ErrorHandler`, should be added,\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedPhpDeprecations [default: true]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedPhpNotices [default: true]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedPhpWarnings [default: true]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedUserDeprecations [default: false]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedUserNotices [default: false]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedUserWarnings [default: false]\r\n\r\nThis would give user (packages, projects) some control back to controll\r\nwhich should be suppressed and which not.

v10 changed how it handles notices, warnings, errors and deprecations. Therefore, converting them to exception has been removed in favour of display/fail options per type. Recently, the last missing piece for notices and deprecation has been added with:\r\n\r\n  #5196: Optionally (fail|stop) on (notice|deprecation) events\r\n\r\nPHPUnit v9 (and possibly earlier versions) did not converted suppressed error levels to exceptions, if the corresponded old and removed option has been set. With PHPUnit v10, only native PHP error level (notices/strict,warnings,deprecated) are not handled if suppressed using the \"@\" suppress operator or by `error_reporting()` configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nUser error levels (notices,warnings,deprecation,error) are no longer suppressable.\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to have only one defined set, which should be suppressable AND suppressed state regonized to suite all needs for framework, packages and applications using PHPUnit to test things. This **must** be configurable for users of the PHPUnit.\r\n\r\nThis change adds configuration options to configure, which error levels are suppressable/suppressed state taking into account. Configuration is only provided through the PHPUnit configuration file. CLI options would not be really usefull, due \"true\" defauls - and therefore some options would be needed to be added \"inverse\". Having this only as XML options is more then suitable.\r\n\r\nAdded xml configuration file options for:\r\n\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedPhpDeprecations [default: true]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedPhpNotices [default: true]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedPhpWarnings [default: true]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedUserDeprecations [default: false]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedUserNotices [default: false]\r\n* (bool) errorHandlerIgnoreSuppressedUserWarnings [default: false]\r\n\r\n**NOTE** ErrorLevels, which are configured to be ignored if\r\n         suppressed, will not fail with corresponding `--fail-on-*`\r\n         configuration/flag. On the other hand, this means that\r\n         if suppressed ignore is configured, it will fail even if\r\n         suppressed.\r\n\r\nE_USER_ERROR, e.g. triggered by using `trigger_error('', E_USER_ERROR)`, are not failing like php errors (E_ERROR). They always dispatches corresponding event. Additionally, there is no `--fail-on-error` flag which could control this for E_USER_ERROR. Therefore, E_USER_ERROR is left for now and should be targeted in a dedicated change.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a couple of tests are added to cover the new options.\r\n\r\nResolves

Composer: allow for PHPUnit 10.0.0\r\n\r\nPHPUnit 10.0 has been released on Feb 3, 2023 and in the mean time PHPUnit 10.1 and 10.2 have also been released.\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n* https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-10.html\r\n* https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/10.0.19/ChangeLog-10.0.md\r\n*

10\r\n\r\nThe initial PHPUnit Polyfills 2.0.0 release will not contain a PHPUnit 10 compatible TestListener implementation.\r\n\r\nThis allows the tests to pass on PHPUnit 10 for now until that has been resolved.\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n* https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills/issues/95#issuecomment-1577408987\r\n* https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills/issues/128\r\n\r\n### CI: update for PHPUnit 10.0.0 support\r\n\r\nAs the PHPUnit Polyfills, as of now, will officially support PHPUnit 10.x, with the exception of the TestListeners, the GH Actions workflow should be updated to reflect this.\r\n\r\nThis commit:\r\n* Add builds for PHP 8.1 and 8.2 against low PHPUnit 10 versions.\r\n    The \"high\" versions are automatically sorted via the matrix `auto` setting in combination with the Composer PHPUnit version requirements being widened.\r\n* Add an extra experimental build against PHP 8.3 to ensure both PHPUnit 9.x as well as PHPUnit 10.x is tested with PHP 8.3.\r\n* Update the experimental build against \"future\" PHPUnit to point to the `main` branch of PHPUnit.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it updates the step which ran a \"trial\" build against PHPUnit 10 by splitting it into two steps: one with and one without coverage. Both are still allowed to fail when running the experimental build against PHPUnit `dev-main`.\r\n\r\n### Tests: fail test runs on deprecations/notices/warnings\r\n\r\nAs this package is used in the CI pipeline for other packages, it is important for this package to be ready for new PHP releases _early_, so failing the test suite on deprecations/notices and warnings is appropriate.\r\n\r\nApparently PHPUnit 10.0 already included a `failOnWarning` option, while PHPUnit 10.1 brings additional `failOnNotice` and `failOnDeprecation` options.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these options are problematic for cross-version PHPUnit usage for the following reasons:\r\n1. They do not translate to the same behaviour between PHPUnit < 10 and PHPUnit 10.x.\r\n    In PHPUnit 9.x, the `convertDeprecationsToExceptions` and sister-options would only act on PHP native deprecations/notices/warnings and would cause a failed build with a non-zero exit code when set to `true` and any PHP deprecations/notices/warnings would be found.\r\n    In PHPUnit 10.x, the `failOnWarning` and sister-options act on **_all_** deprecations/notices/warnings, not just the PHP native ones, and cause a failed build with a non-zero exit code when set to `true`.\r\n    In practice, this means that when the `failOn*` options are used, PHPUnit native deprecations/notices/warnings will now also fail a build, which was not the case in PHPUnit < 10.\r\n2. As the XML file is validated against the XSD file, this means that you cannot add the `failOnNotice`/`failOnDeprecation` options in a configuration file which will be used on PHPUnit 10.0 as that would fail the XSD validation, leading to a PHPUnit warning which would fail the build.\r\n3. Along the same lines, as the `include`/`exclude` elements within the `coverage` element are deprecated as of PHPUnit 10.1, in favour of using `source` with `include`/`exclude`, a configuration which validates on PHPUnit 10.0 will not validate correctly on PHPUnit 10.1 leading to a deprecation notice, which would fail the build when `failOnDeprecation` is on.\r\n... etc...\r\n\r\nThis basically means that if you want PHPUnit to fail a build on PHP native deprecations/notices/warnings (which you should want for open source projects, most definitely open source projects in the PHP tool chain), you will now no longer be allowed to have **_any_** PHPUnit deprecations/notices/warnings as those will now also fail the build.\r\n\r\nIt also means that a new release of PHPUnit can randomly start failing builds if a change was made in PHPUnit which causes a new deprecation/notice/warning to be thrown.\r\n\r\nAll in all, not pretty and it makes things a heck of a lot less stable, but it is what it is for now, so we better deal with it.\r\n\r\nSo, to get round this and to have the most optimal configuration for PHPUnit 10.x possible at this time....\r\n1. The `failOnWarning` option is added to the `phpunit10.xml.dist` file as it is already available in PHPUnit 10.0.\r\n2. A new \"Migrate configuration\" step needs to be added to the GH Actions test workflow.\r\n    This step will migrate the `phpunit10.xml.dist` file, which is compatible with PHPUnit 10.0, to a version which is compatible with whichever PHPUnit 10.x version the tests are being run on.\r\n    This step will fail when there is nothing to migrate, so it needs a `continue-on-error` to ignore that failure.\r\n    Note: the migration step will also fail when the original XML file doesn't validate against the original XSD, which is why the base configuration needs to be for PHPUnit 10.0.\r\n3. As for the `failOnNotice`/`failOnDeprecation` options: those cannot be added to the config for the above mentioned reasons (failure to validate against the PHPUnit 10.0 XSD), but they also cannot be added to the \"default\" command used for running the tests on PHPUnit 10 as a run against PHPUnit 10.0 would then fail with an \"Unknown option ....\" error.\r\n    In other words, the only realistic way to add these, for now, is to add them to the command on the fly for those test runs where PHPUnit 10.1 or higher will be used.\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#5196\r\n*

Tests: make dataproviders static\r\n\r\nAs of PHPUnit 10, data providers are (again) expected to be `static` methods.\r\n\r\nThis updates the test suite to respect that.\r\n\r\nIncludes removing the

configuration\r\n\r\nThe PHPunit configuration file specification has undergone changes in PHPUnit 9.3, 10.0 and 10.1.\r\n\r\nMost notably:\r\n* In PHPUnit 9.3, the manner of specifying the code coverage configuration has changed.\r\n* In PHPUnit 10.0, a significant number of attributes of the `<phpunit>` element were removed or renamed.\r\n* In PHPUnit 10.1, there is another change related to the code coverage configuration + the ability to fail builds on deprecations/warnings/notices is brought back.\r\n\r\nWhile the `--migrate-configuration` command can upgrade a configuration for the changes in the format made in PHPUnit 9.3, some of the changes in the configuration format in PHPUnit 10 don't have one-on-one replacements and/or are not taken into account.\r\n\r\nAs this package is used in the CI pipeline for other packages, it is important for this package to be ready for new PHP releases _early_, so failing the test suite on deprecatios/notices and warnings is appropriate.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I deem it more appropriate to have a dedicated PHPUnit configuration file for PHPUnit 10 to ensure the test run will behave as intended.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds this dedicated configuration file for PHPUnit 10.1+.\r\n\r\nIncludes:\r\n* Ignoring the new file for package archives.\r\n* Allowing for a local override file.\r\n* Adding scripts to the `composer.json` file to run the tests using this new configuration file and make the use of the separate config make more obvious for contributors.\r\n* Updating the GH Actions `test` workflow to trigger the tests on PHPUnit 10 with this configuration file.\r\n\r\nRef:\r\n* https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/main/ChangeLog-10.0.md#1000---2023-02-03\r\n*

as well, making the test suite compatible with that should wait for a while as we'll need PHPUnit 11.1 (expected April 5th) as a minimum and will need to make significant other changes to the tests, like splitting test classes based on what the tests cover, before we can start running the tests on PHPUnit 11.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Parallel-Lint/issues/157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Parallel-Lint/issues/157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jrfnl","id":663378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl","html_url":"https://github.com/jrfnl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrfnl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-09T08:13:12Z","updated_at":"2024-04-09T08:13:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Console-Color/issues/46","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Console-Color","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Console-Color/issues/46/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Console-Color/issues/46/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Console-Color/issues/46/events","html_url":"https://github.com/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Console-Color/pull/46","id":2232867078,"node_id":"PR_kwDODk2FKs5sGa0L","number":46,"title":"PHPUnit:

strictly enforced as of PHPUnit 10.\r\n\r\nRef: sebastianbergmann/phpunit#5132\r\n\r\n### Tests: allow for PHPUnit 10 and 11\r\n\r\nThis commit makes the necessary changes in the CI wiring to allow for running the tests on PHPUnit 8, 9, 10 and 11 and still failing them on PHP deprecations and notices like before.\r\n\r\nThe PHPUnit configuration file specification has undergone changes in PHPUnit 9.3, 10.0, 10.1 and 10.5.32/11.3.3.\r\n\r\nMost notably:\r\n* In PHPUnit 9.3, the manner of specifying the code coverage configuration has changed, though the \"old\" way is still supported on PHPUnit 9, but not on PHPUnit 10.\r\n* In PHPUnit 10.0, a significant number of attributes of the `<phpunit>` element were removed or renamed and failing test runs on PHP deprecations or notices was no longer possible.\r\n* In PHPUnit 10.1 a further iteration was released on the way to specify code coverage, which now expects a `<source>` element.\r\n    Additionally, it is now possible again to fail a test run on PHP deprecations/notices.\r\n* In PHPUnit 10.5.32/11.3.3 new `displayDetailsOnPhpunitDeprecations` and `failOnPhpunitDeprecation` options were introduced.\r\n    As of PHPUnit 10.0, the option to fail tests on (PHP) deprecation notices would **_also_** fail the tests on PHPUnit deprecation notices, while those are only relevant when upgrading to the _next_ PHPUnit version. This made things a bit awkward. This was, at long last, fixed via the new options in PHPUnit 10.5.32/11.3.3.\r\n\r\nWhile the `--migrate-configuration` command can upgrade a configuration for the changes in the format made in PHPUnit 9.3, some of the changes in the configuration format in PHPUnit 10 don't have one-on-one replacements and/or are not taken into account.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I deem it more appropriate to have a dedicated PHPUnit configuration file for PHPUnit 10/11 to ensure the test runs will behave as intended.\r\nTo be forward compatible, the default PHPUnit config file `phpunit.xml.dist` will now use the PHPUnit 10+ format, while a separate `phpunit-lte9.xml.dist` file will be used for PHPUnit 8 and 9.\r\n\r\n> :point_up: This means that contributors who run on recent PHP versions, should just be able to run `vendor/bin/phpunit`. Only contributors who run on PHP < 8.1 and therefore run on PHPUnit < 10, will need to be aware of the difference in the config files.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this commit makes the following changes:\r\n* Rename the \"old\" PHPUnit configuration file to `phpunit-lte9.xml.dist`\r\n    - This file has also been added to `.gitattributes` to ignore for distribution packages.\r\n    - An entry for `phpunit-lte9.xml` has been added to the `.gitignore` file.\r\n        While a contributor can choose the name for a config overload file for the `phpunit-lte9.xml.dist` file freely, it is a good convention to use the same name as the file being overloaded, minus the `.dist`, so ignoring that filename by default seems appropriate.\r\n    - Composer scripts have been added to run the tests with the `phpunit-lte9.xml.dist` file and these new scripts are also mentioned in the `CONTRIBUTING` file.\r\n* The `phpunit.xml.dist` now contains the PHPUnit configuration for running the tests on PHPUnit 10.5+.\r\n    This includes the appropriate settings to fail the test runs on any PHP deprecations, notices or warnings.\r\n    Take note that the `cacheDirectory` option has been set to a custom directory which is already git ignored.\r\n* The GH Actions scripts have been updated to include a PHPUnit version based toggle and run the tests with the correct configuration file depending on the PHPUnit version being used.\r\n* Composer: allow for PHPUnit 10 on version 10.5.32 or higher and PHPUnit 11 on v 11.3.3 or higher.\r\n    The 10.5.32/11.3.3 version are deliberately set as the minimum as:\r\n    - the `failOnNotice` and `failOnDeprecation` attributes can now be set in the XML config file (PHPUnit 10.1+).\r\n    - the `source` element for the XML config file was introduced in 10.1.\r\n    - the `displayDetailsOnPhpunitDeprecations` and `failOnPhpunitDeprecation` attributes can be set (PHPUnit 10.5.32/11.3.3+).\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n* https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-10.html\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#5196\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit@fb6673f\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#5937\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit@1a5d2b8\r\n\r\n\r\n### PHPStan: exclude *all* test files\r\n\r\nThe `/tests` directory was already excluded, but the _sniff_ test directories were not and what with a different PHPUnit version being used and PHPStan - apparently - struggling to understand the inheritance, let's just exclude the rest of the test files as well until such time as the PHPStan setup is made compatible with the tests.\r\n\r\n## Suggested changelog entry\r\nChanged:\r\n- The test framework is now compatible with PHPUnit 8.x - 11.x (ignoring PHPUnit deprecations related to PHPUnit 12).\r\n- The two abstract base tests cases have been renamed.\r\n    - Replace `PHP_CodeSniffer\\Tests\\Standards\\AbstractSniffUnitTest` with `PHP_CodeSniffer\\Tests\\Standards\\AbstractSniffTestCase`.\r\n    - Replace `PHP_CodeSniffer\\Tests\\Core\\AbstractMethodUnitTest` with `PHP_CodeSniffer\\Tests\\Core\\AbstractMethodTestCase`.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
