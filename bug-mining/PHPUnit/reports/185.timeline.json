`--group` commandline option does not seem to overide the `<group><exclude></group>` setting. IMHO it should.\n\nUse case: I have a few very slow tests that I put into a single group (`@group slow`). Normally I do not want to run them, so I put them in the `group/exlude` tag in `phpunit.xml` to ignore them. Sometimes I do want to run them, so I type this on the commandline:\n\n```\nphpunit --group slow\n```\n\nI expect PHPUnit to run all the tests in the `slow` group because commanline options override phpunit.xml options. But in reality, no tests are run. Furthermore, there seems to be no other way to un-exclude a group on the commandline that has been exlcuded in the xml
