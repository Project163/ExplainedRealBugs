years ago, with version 4.5, PHPUnit started to bundle [phpspec/prophecy](https://github.com/phpspec/prophecy) as an alternative to PHPUnit's own test double functionality.\r\n\r\nIn the context of the above, \"bundling\" means that\r\n\r\n* `phpspec/prophecy` is listed as a dependency in PHPUnit's `composer.json` file\r\n* `phpunit.phar`, the PHAR distribution of PHPUnit, contains Prophecy as well as its dependencies\r\n* `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase` provides the [`prophesize()`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/9.0.1/src/Framework/TestCase.php#L1850) method to create a test double using Prophecy (allowing `TestCase` to automatically verify Prophecy expectations at the end of the test while also providing [integration with PHPUnit's risky test analysis](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/9.0.1/src/Framework/TestCase.php#L1942))\r\n\r\n5 years ago, I wrote in an article\r\n\r\n> at some point in the future we will encourage developers to use Prophecy's API instead of the \"classic\" PHPUnit API\r\n\r\nThis has not happended so far and I now doubt that it will.\r\n\r\n`phpspec/prophecy` depends on the `sebastian/comparator` and `sebastian/recursion-context` components that are used by PHPUnit. And since PHPUnit currently depends on `phpspec/prophecy` we have circular dependencies.\r\n\r\nThese circular dependencies are especially annoying whenever I bump the major version of `sebastian/comparator` and `sebastian/recursion-context` because @ciaranmcnulty needs to [make the same change in `phpspec/prophecy` at the same time](https://github.com/phpspec/prophecy/commit/77f7690a1a62062180583415a9b8252fcddc48b0) (otherwise PHPUnit breaks).\r\n\r\nIt is because of this circular dependency that I am beginning to think that the tight integration of Prophecy into PHPUnit causes more harm than good.\r\n\r\nI would like to deprecate `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase::prophesize()` (and any associated functionality) in PHPUnit 9.X and remove it in PHPUnit 10.","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4141/reactions","total_count":60,"+1":38,"-1":16,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4141/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
