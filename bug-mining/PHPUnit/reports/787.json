can automatically generate test stubs and mock objects (test doubles) based on interfaces and classes.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to doubling classes, there are limitations:\r\n\r\n* `final`, `private`, and `static` methods cannot be doubled; they retain their original behavior except for static methods which will be replaced by a method throwing an exception\r\n* Enumerations (`enum`) are `final` classes and therefore cannot be doubled\r\n* `readonly` classes cannot be extended by classes that are not `readonly` and therefore cannot be doubled\r\n\r\n**Not only because of the limitations mentioned above, but also to improve your software design, PHPUnit's documentation recommends to favour the doubling of interfaces over the doubling of classes.**\r\n\r\nFor quite a while, PHPUnit has offered the `createStub()` and `createMock()` methods for creating test stubs and mock objects with best practice defaults. Furthermore, alternatives such as `getMockForAbstractClass()` exist, but not all of them offer the same clear separation between test double and mock object. For instance, no method named `getStubForAbstractClass()` exists. Such an inconsistency can lead to confusion.\r\n\r\nAs its name suggests, the `getMockForAbstractClass()` method can be used to create a mock object for an abstract class: a mock object where all abstract methods of the original class are implemented in such a way that they can be configured to return a specified value, for instance, or to expect an invocation.\r\n\r\nHaving to use `getMockForAbstractClass()` to test something is almost always a code smell: something is not quite right with the software design of the system-under-test.\r\n\r\nTo promote better software design, improve the readability of test code, and to reduce complexity inside PHPUnit's test double functionality, `TestCase::getMockForAbstractClass()` will be deprecated and then removed:\r\n\r\n- soft deprecation in PHPUnit 10.1 (add `@deprecated` annotation to the method declaration)\r\n- deprecation in PHPUnit 11 (using the method will trigger a deprecation)\r\n- removal in PHPUnit 12","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5241/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":4,"-1":11,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5241/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
