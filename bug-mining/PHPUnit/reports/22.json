If it does, the test will be marked as incomplete and it will not yield code coverage.\n- In strict mode, a \"small\" test must use the `@covers` annotation to declare the component-under-test.\n- In strict mode, a \"small\" test must not perform I/O operations. If it does, the test will be marked as incomplete and it will not yield code coverage.\n- In strict mode, a \"medium\" test may execute code other than that of the component-under-test.\n- In strict mode, a \"medium\" test must not perform I/O operations. If it does, the test will be marked as incomplete and it will not yield code coverage.\n- In strict mode, only a \"large\" test may perform I/O operations.\n- The test categorization can be used to weigh the code coverage based on the authoritativeness of the test: a \"small\" test yields more valuable code coverage than a large test.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
