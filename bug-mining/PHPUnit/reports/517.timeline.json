uses PHPUnit and Psalm, Psalm detects the issue in PHPUnit that cannot be fixed in the project and therefore have to be suppressed.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: PropertyNotSetInConstructor - tests/ExampleTest.php:7:7 - Property \r\nTest\\ExampleTest::$backupGlobals is not defined in constructor of Test\\ExampleTest and in any \r\nmethods called in the constructor (see https://psalm.dev/074)\r\nclass ExampleTest extends TestCase\r\n```\r\nThe above is caused by a boolean property being non-initialized:\r\n1. https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/61f7c75a11eb1c6908c87235757a428de2bae6d1/src/Framework/TestCase.php#L63-L66\r\n2.

declare(strict_types=1);\r\n\r\nnamespace Test;\r\n\r\nuse PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase;\r\n\r\nclass ExampleTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * @test\r\n     */\r\n    public function

classes, suppressing errors in the `vendor/` directory doesn't help.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe value of `$backupGlobals` is always within its declared type constraints.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"morozov","id":59683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov","html_url":"https://github.com/morozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-20T15:09:16Z","updated_at":"2020-06-20T15:09:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4309","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4309/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4309/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4309/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4309","id":642393355,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDIzOTMzNTU=","number":4309,"title":"PHPUnit

https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/cb135993b214d87d1cc10359201d23b8ab2057bc/src/Framework/MockObject/Builder/InvocationMocker.php#L29-L32\r\n\r\nThis issue was already brought up in https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3742#issuecomment-559682132.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php declare(strict_types=1);\r\n\r\nnamespace Test;\r\n\r\nuse PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase;\r\n\r\nclass ExampleTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * @test\r\n     */\r\n    public function testExample() : void\r\n    {\r\n        $t = $this->createMock(T::class);\r\n        $t->expects(\r\n            $this->never()\r\n        )->method('test');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface T\r\n{\r\n    public function test() : void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the full demo project in the [gist](https://gist.github.com/morozov/189e817c9ca8eee4d225f1d3475bc230):\r\n```\r\n$ composer install\r\n$ vendor/bin/psalm\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the project's tests extend and use the PHPUnit test classes, suppressing errors in the `vendor/` directory doesn't help.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPHPUnit doesn't expose the internal parts of its API to the userland.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4309/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4309/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
