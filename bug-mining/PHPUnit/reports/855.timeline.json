PR upgrades to PHPUnit 11, including using it's deprecation handling features. Starting with PHPUnit 11, all deprecations features from the bridge are implemented in PHPUnit.\r\n\r\nThis PR also stops using the PhpunitBridge wrapper, which is recommended for applications in the documentation for at least the past 2 years.\r\n\r\nI've added the configuration to make PHPUnit not report indirect deprecations (those caused by 3rd party code), and to fail on a test that triggers a direct deprecation. I think this is the most sensible default configuration that we should promote. If we agree, I'll create a recipe to do this automatically.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has mostly been created as a test to see what we need to fix in recipes/code and add to the documentation about
