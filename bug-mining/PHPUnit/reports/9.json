I first hat this problem with the Zend_Framework Autoloader, and then tried my own autoloader:\n\n```\nfunction test_autoload($class) {\n$file = str_replace('_', '/', $class) . '.php';\nrequire_once $file;\n}\n\nspl_autoload_register('test_autoload');\n```\n\nThe reason that the exception is thrown is because my autoloader is called by the function class_exists in PHPUnit_Framework_Assert. Should I use assertType only for classs and not string, int etc.? Or how should I modify my autoloader? Is this an expected behaviour?\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
