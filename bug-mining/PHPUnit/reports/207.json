However, it depends (via composer) on php-code-coverage > 1.2.1 and php-timer > 1.0.2. Those two criteria can be matched by versions that require PHP 5.4.\nThus, only depending on phpunit 3.7 leads to a set of dependencies that is not compatible with PHP 5.3.\n\nTo fix this issue, I added explicit dependencies to older versions of the specified packages:\n\n```\n    \"phpunit/phpunit\": \"3.7.*\",\n    \"phpunit/php-code-coverage\": \"1.2.*\",\n    \"phpunit/php-timer\": \"1.0.4\",\n```\n\nI guess that this issue could be resolved by adding upper version limits for the dependencies in question.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/816/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
