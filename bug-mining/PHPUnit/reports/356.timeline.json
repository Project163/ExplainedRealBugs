Yet, when latest tooling is used, tests throw warnings (unexpected behaviour).  Part of the issue seems to stem from Ref B, which highlights a decision to avoid referencing PHPUnit as a developmental requirement.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactphp/reactphp/issues/354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactphp/reactphp/issues/354/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":761234885,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc2MTIzNDg4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/761234885","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c2aba455df9ea23924a2a1df84ba9a88a9f59a9b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commits/c2aba455df9ea23924a2a1df84ba9a88a9f59a9b","created_at":"2016-08-19T13:00:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":761236195,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzYxMjM2MTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/761236195","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-19T13:02:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
