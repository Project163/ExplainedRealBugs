don't support var replacements during install, so if you don't set the version constant before tagging this is not gonna be easy. For users it's fairly easy, they can do `composer show phpunit/phpunit` and see which version they got installed. If you really want to do it, you can hack something up using the composer installed repository:\n\n```\n$packages = json_decode(file_get_contents(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../composer/installed.json'));\n```\n\nThen you can check in packages for the version of phpunit/phpunit.
