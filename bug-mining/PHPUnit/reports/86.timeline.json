If that is the case the file is added to the list of \"testCases to execute\".\n\nAfter that it creates a new instance of the class for each test method in the Class and executes that test.\n\nThe numbers are gather to show the progress bar / status indicator and other things like filtering on @group tags.\n\nIf we would NOT INCLUDE the file we'd have to extract all of that information using some sort of static reflection which is slow, painful and error prone (try getting the inheritance hierarchy of something with only static analysis when you don't know where the source files are).\n\nSo I don't see any way for use to implement that. \n\nLike my answer you linked showed it already works for stuff inside the test cases but to be honest I don't see how this could be done with only somewhat reasonable effort - Even after the planned test runner refactorings.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/5077727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13205809,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTMyMDU4MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/13205809","actor":{"login":"group","id":245245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTI0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/group","html_url":"https://github.com/group","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-04-11T20:05:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13205810,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzMjA1ODEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/13205810","actor":{"login":"group","id":245245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTI0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/group","html_url":"https://github.com/group","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/group/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-04-11T20:05:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13205811,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzMjA1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/13205811","actor":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-04-11T20:05:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/5079258","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/545#issuecomment-5079258","issue_url":"https://api.github.

constants (not class constants) defined outside the class definition persist across all tests, whereas global constants (not class constants) defined inside the class do not persist.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/554/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":26342543,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjYzNDI1NDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/26342543","actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-10-07T06:42:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
