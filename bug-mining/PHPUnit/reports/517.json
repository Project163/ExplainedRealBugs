Q                   | A\r\n| --------------------| ---------------\r\n| PHPUnit version     | 8.2.3\r\n| PHP version         | 7.3.5\r\n| Installation Method | Composer \r\n\r\nWhen using PHPUnit's built-in mocking capabilities, and type-checking my code with [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/), I get `InternalMethod` issues raised for [PHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Builder\\InvocationMocker::willReturn](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/8.2.3/src/Framework/MockObject/Builder/InvocationMocker.php#L70), [PHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Builder\\InvocationMocker::method](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/8.2.3/src/Framework/MockObject/Builder/InvocationMocker.php#L192), and [PHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Builder\\InvocationMocker::with](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/8.2.3/src/Framework/MockObject/Builder/InvocationMocker.php#L152).\r\n\r\nThis is due to the annotation on the class: https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/f67ca36860ebca7224d4573f107f79bd8ed0ba03/src/Framework/MockObject/Builder/InvocationMocker.php#L22\r\n\r\nFor example with the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public function test_we_get_null_user_id_for_unknown_user(): void\r\n    {\r\n        $this->mockUserAccountRepository->method('findByAccountId')\r\n            ->with($this->equalTo(Uuid::NIL)) // Psalm emits issue 'The method PHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Builder\\InvocationMocker::with has been marked as internal'\r\n            ->willReturn(null) // Psalm emits issue 'The method PHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Builder\\InvocationMocker::willReturn has been marked as internal'\r\n        ;\r\n\r\n        $id = $this->userAccountService->getUserId(Uuid::NIL);\r\n\r\n        self::assertSame(null, $id);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as far as I can tell I'm following the instructions in the docs at https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/8.2/test-doubles.html#mock-objects . \r\n\r\nIf I'm not using PHPUnit wrong, I think that probably either the `@internal` annotation should be removed from `InvocationMocker`, and perhaps added to some of its functions that are not mentioned in the documentation, such as the constructor, or the return type declared at https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/f67ca36860ebca7224d4573f107f79bd8ed0ba03/src/Framework/MockObject/MockObject.php#L16 should be changed from `BuilderInvocationMocker`, which is an alias of `InvocationMocker`, to an interface containing just the functions we should be relying on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3742/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
