This was good.\r\n\r\nAlso as part of #3422, and implemented in #3425, optional parameters for `assertContains()` that have an effect when non-string haystacks (read: `iterable` haystacks) are used, were deprecated. The result of this is that, once these optional parameters are completely removed in PHPUnit 9 (see #3426), there is currently no way to assert that an object is contained in an `iterable` while using `==` instead of `===`. This is bad and something should be done about it.\r\n\r\nThe original implementation of #3422 in 297588872f45c322e44e0feba93e3d13e6af389a introduced new assertions `assertIterableContains()` and `assertIterableContainsSame()`, for instance, to support the two separate use cases of asserting that an object is contained in an `iterable`, once using `==` and once using `===`, respectively. This idea was abandoned in order to avoid additional backward compatibility breaks that would have resulted from deprecating the original `assertContains()` methods.","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3511/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3511/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
