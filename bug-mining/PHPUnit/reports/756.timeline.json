10 brings both several changes to the configuration file and a misfeature of causing `phpunit` to exit with a non-zero status if the config file does not strictly validate.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, if you had been relying on `convert{X}ToExceptions=\"true\"`, you might want to set `displayDetailsOnTestsThatTrigger{X}=\"true\"` and `failOn{X}=\"true\"` for PHPUnit 10 to maintain that behavior going forward. But unless you also remove `convert{X}ToExceptions=\"true\"`, changing the behavior for runs with earlier versions of PHP, PHPUnit 10 will whine about not recognizing the old setting and will exit with a failure status even if all actual tests pass.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the best way around this might be.\r\n\r\nSimplest might be to provide a wrapper script that, if not passed `-c` or `--configuration` or `--no-configuration`, looks for various config file names and picks the best one for the current version of PHPUnit to set `--configuration` before execing `phpunit`. For example, it might check for any \"phpunit.{VER}.xml.dist\" and pick the one with the highest `{VER}` that's not greater than PHPUnit's own version.\r\n\r\nA little fancier might be a wrapper that determines the configuration file in the same way PHPUnit would, copies it to a temporary file while stripping a predefined list of settings based on the PHPUnit version, and calls `phpunit` with `--configuration` pointing to the temporary file.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately PHPUnit doesn't provide any way to hook into its own code to handle things more directly. There might still be ways, but they'd be fragile.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills/issues/134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1585485592","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5405#issuecomment-1585485592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5405","id":1585485592,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbWLc5egJcY","user":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-10T04:59:51Z","updated_at":"2023-06-10T04:59:51Z","body":"The

No, you don't, because it doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience and for providing me with the information I thought I needed.\r\n\r\nThe functionality controlled by `--migrate-configuration` was [introduced](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4288) in [PHPUnit 9.3](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/9.3.0/ChangeLog-9.3.md#930---2020-08-07). It is only meant to support the migration of XML configuration files that are compatible with the `phpunit.xsd` of PHPUnit 8.5 (or newer). Therefore, PHPUnit 5.7.27, PHPUnit 6.5.14, PHPUnit 7.5.20 are out of scope here.\r\n\r\nThe exception is triggered by the `RemoveEmptyFilter` migration which assumes that the `MoveWhitelistDirectoriesToCoverage` migration, which is run before `RemoveEmptyFilter`, moved all `<whitelist>` elements from the old structure to the new structure. However, as the name already implies, `MoveWhitelistDirectoriesToCoverage` only moves `whitelist/directory` elements, thus leaving behind `whitelist/file` elements.\r\n\r\nThis will be addressed
