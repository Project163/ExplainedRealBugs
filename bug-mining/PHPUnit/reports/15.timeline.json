Is there any chance that a feature could be added to specify use of a different template set at runtime? e.g. in phpunit.xml or phpunit --templatedir ../templates for example. (this would let me have different templates based on the item I am testing - e.g. for Zend I could use my Zend test skeleton or for say a straight php unit skeleton using the default template set etc).\nMany thanks again.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/534562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anw","id":448275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODI3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw","html_url":"https://github.com/anw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
