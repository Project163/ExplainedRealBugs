Q                         | A\r\n| --------------------------| ---------------\r\n| php-code-coverage version | 10.1.1\r\n| PHP version               | 8.2.5\r\n| Driver                    | Xdebug\r\n| Xdebug version (if used)  | 3.2.1\r\n| Installation Method       | irrelevant, same result in both cases\r\n| Usage Method              | PHPUnit\r\n| PHPUnit version (if used) | 10.1.2\r\n\r\n### Given\r\n* A `phpunit.xml.dist` config file which includes the `forceCoversAnnotation=\"true\"` (PHPUnit 9.x) or `requireCoverageMetadata=\"true\"` (PHPUnit 10.x) directive;\r\n* And a test which has a `@covers` tag for a method which doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n### I'd expect\r\nThat no code coverage would be recorded for the test with the incorrect `@covers` tag, along the same lines as if the test had a `@covers` tag for a method which wasn't run during the test.\r\n\r\nAnd if the test had multiple `@covers` tags, I'd expect code coverage only to be recorded for the valid tags.\r\n\r\n### What happened instead\r\nCoverage was recorded as if `forceCoversAnnotation`/`requireCoverageMetadata` was set to `false`, i.e. all code which was run during the test now shows as covered, even though there are no tests with the appropriate `@covers` tags for that code.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction scenario\r\n\r\nSee the individual commits in the https://github.com/jrfnl/bug-report-reproduction-scenarios/tree/php-code-coverage/997-wrong-covers-tag-wrong-coverage branch.\r\nEach commit includes the coverage reports (text summary in the commit message, HTML + Clover reports in the actual commits).\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
