PHPUnit/Util/Log/TAP.php checks for `class_exists('Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Yaml\\\\Dumper', FALSE)` -- the `FALSE` suppresses autoload so the class isn't found\n5. PHPUnit/Util/Log/TAP.php then does `require_once 'Symfony/Component/Yaml/Dumper.php'` which obviously doesn't exist\n6. normally it'd still work thanks to `\"include-path\": [\"\", \"../../symfony/yaml/\"]` in `composer.json` (I'm guessing another hack piled on top of the `class_exists` one?) but that doesn't work because it's in vendor/symfony/symfony instead of vendor/symfony/yaml\n\nA complete test case:\n- download Symfony Standard Edition 2.1.2 and composer.phar\n- `php composer.phar require phpunit/phpunit` (version range `*`)\n- `cd app`\n- add this to phpunit.xml.dist: `<logging><log type=\"tap\" target=\"blahblah\" /></logging>`\n- `../vendor/bin/phpunit`\n\nProposed fix: get rid of the `FALSE` and the `include-path`. (Or would that break anything? Why is it done this way in the first place?)\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/688/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
