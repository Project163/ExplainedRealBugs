now, the `Stub` interface looks like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @method InvocationStubber method($constraint)\r\n *\r\n * @no-named-arguments Parameter names are not covered by the backward compatibility promise for PHPUnit\r\n */\r\ninterface Stub\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test double code generator checks whether the interface(s) (or class) to be doubled have a method named `method`.\r\n\r\nIf there is no such method then the generated class will have a method named `method` that allows the configuration of methods on the test double object:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$stub = $this->createStub(AnInterface::class);\r\n\r\n$stub->method('doSomething')->willReturn('value');\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the interface(s) (or class) to be doubled have a method named `method` then the test double code generator will leave that method as-is. In this case, the example shown above has to be written like so:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$stub = $this->createStub(AnInterface::class);\r\n\r\n$stub->expects($this->any())->method('doSomething')->willReturn('value');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation, which only exists because of an unlikely edge case (when do you call a method `method`?), results in unnecessary complexity which I would like to get rid of. Furthermore, the `expects()` method should only exist on mock objects (e.g. created with `createMock()`), but not on test stubs (e.g. created with `createStub()`).\r\n\r\nOnce the support for doubling interfaces (or classes) that have a method named `method` has been removed, the `Stub` interface can be changed to look like so:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @no-named-arguments Parameter names are not covered by the backward compatibility promise for PHPUnit\r\n */\r\ninterface Stub\r\n{\r\n    public function method($constraint): InvocationStubber;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt that point in time we can also change `createStub()` et. al. to return an object that does not have `expects()`.","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
