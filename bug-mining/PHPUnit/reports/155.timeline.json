is in response to this [tweet by Freek](https://twitter.com/freekmurze/status/1144256094128267264) about providing a way to pass the reason why a policy has denied access to something. We currently have the ability to set a descriptive message but not a \"status\" code/enum of some kind.\r\n\r\nAs we're simply throwing an exception and exceptions support status codes, we can use same functionality by allowing a second parameter to be passed to the deny method to set the status code:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nuse App\\Post;\r\n\r\nclass PostPolicy\r\n{\r\n    use HandlesAuthorization;\r\n\r\n    public function view(?$user, Post $post)\r\n    {\r\n        if (is_null($post->published_at)) {\r\n            return $this->deny('Not allowed to view as it is not published.', 'unpublished');\r\n       }\r\n\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nIf you catch the `AuthorizationException` you'll now have access to the actual status code on the exception object itself:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nArtisan::command('test', function () {\r\n    try {\r\n        Gate::authorize('view', $post);\r\n    } catch (AuthorizationException $e) {\r\n        dd($e->getCode()); // unpublished\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could allow you to output a different error message under certain scenarioes or generate other useful metrics as the status codes are less volatile than error messages.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/28976/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/28976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
