provides a function _write_, which has this line:\n`$buffer = htmlspecialchars($buffer);`\n\nThe use of _htmlspecialchars_ in combination with invalid utf8 is problematic:\n[PHP: htmlspecialchars](http://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php)\n\n> If the input string contains an invalid code unit sequence within the given encoding an empty string will be returned, unless either the ENT_IGNORE or ENT_SUBSTITUTE flags are set.\n\nThis can lead to irritating behaviour, when `Printer->write` is fed with such input.\n\nTake for example the following simple test:\n\n```\n<?php\n\nclass Invalid_UTF8_Test extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase\n{\n    public function test_invalid_utf8()\n    {\n        $this->assertSame(\"\\xbf\", '');\n    }\n}\n```\n\nthe output of phpunit will look like this:\n\n```\nPHPUnit 5.2.4 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\n\nRuntime:       PHP 5.6.22 with Xdebug 2.4.0\nConfiguration: XXX/phpunit.xml\n\nF                                                                   1 / 1 (100%)\n\nTime: 167 ms, Memory: 7.50MB\n\nThere was 1 failure:\n\n1) Invalid_UTF8_Test::test_invalid_utf8\n\nFAILURES!\nTests: 1, Assertions: 1, Failures: 1.\n```\n\nIt will print, that a failure occured, but not where exactly and what went wrong.\n\nIt get´s even worse, when you use a dataProvider:\n\n```\n<?php\n\nclass Invalid_UTF8_Test extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase\n{\n    public function provider_invalid_utf8()\n    {\n        return [\n            [\"\\xbf\"],\n        ];\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dataProvider provider_invalid_utf8\n     */\n    public function test_invalid_utf8($input)\n    {\n        $this->assertSame($input, '');\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow the output will look like this:\n\n```\nPHPUnit 5.2.4 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\n\nRuntime:       PHP 5.6.22 with Xdebug 2.4.0\nConfiguration: XXX/phpunit.xml\n\nF                                                                   1 / 1 (100%)\n\nTime: 148 ms, Memory: 7.75MB\n\nThere was 1 failure:\n\nFAILURES!\nTests: 1, Assertions: 1, Failures: 1.\n```\n\nNow you can´t even see in which test the failure occured.\n\nThe issue is solved, when the above line in _Printer->write_ is changed to:\n`$buffer = htmlspecialchars($buffer, ENT_SUBSTITUTE);`\n\nWhile this may look like a constructed example, i actually hit this problem when writing tests to check how our code is handling invalid utf8.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
