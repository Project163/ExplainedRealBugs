happens because `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase::setExpectedException()` doesn't actually raise the `PHPUnit_Framework_AssertionFailedError` exception.  Instead, the exception is raised internally from `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase::runTest()`.  Consequently, when the stack trace is filtered with `PHPUnit_Util_Filter::getFilteredStacktrace()`, the entire trace is filtered out.\n\nThe solution for this is to make note of the stack trace at the moment `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase::setExpectedException()` is called and use that stack trace instead.\n\nI've created a topic branch that solves this issue here: http://github.com/whatthejeff/phpunit/tree/issue_5.

This causes PHP to try to autoload this class which does not exist. If I understand the xml configuration correctly the name should just be a label for the tests and it shouldn't have to correspond to a real test suite

However, since it is a type error, I would hope it might be possible to find it while analysing the code. I looked at the code and I see that there is an assert before, but it is most likely disabled.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPHPUnit runs without internal
