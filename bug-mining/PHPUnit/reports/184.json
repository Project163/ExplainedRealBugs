We had a private $pdo variable containing an instance of the PDO class. Once we created the following  __destruct() function, all asserts (AssertTrue, AssertEqual, etc.) passed, even if they shouldn't have.\n\nHere is the important part of the code:\n<code>\nclass DatabaseConnection\n{\n    private $pdo;\n    public function __construct($connectionString, $user, $password)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            $this->pdo = new PDO($connectionString, $user, $password);\n            $this->pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT, true);\n        }\n        catch(PDOException $e){ }\n    }\n\n```\npublic function __destruct()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        $this->pdo->rollBack();\n    }\n    catch(PDOException $e) {}      \n}\n```\n\n}\n</code>\n\nThan after \n<code>\n$connection=new DatabaseConnection($this->dbcon, $this->dbuser, $this->dbpasswd);\n</code>\nin a test \n<code>\n$this->AssertFalse(true);\n</code>\nwill not cause the test to fail. \n\nAny ideas what could cause the problem?\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
