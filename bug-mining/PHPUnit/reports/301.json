According to [Crap4j faq](http://www.crap4j.org/faq.html), this is a point where you have to start refactoring your code. Well, but in a goode php-project, you might want to see even CRAPpy code with less CRAP than 30.\n\nPlease make this threshold configurable, for example via phpunit.xml.\n\nBackground is, CRAPpy methods with less than 30 CRAP-points get a crapLoad = 0 ([PHP_CodeCoverage_Report_Crap4j::getCrapLoad()](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage/blob/master/src/CodeCoverage/Report/Crap4j.php#L119)). I am using crap4j.xml within Jenkins and [Crap4j Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Crap4J+Plugin), and a I want to have methods with CRAP >= 20 reported by this plugin.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
