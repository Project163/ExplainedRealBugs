Added config/logging.php\r\n- Several vendor versions were updated in composer.json file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\"fideloper/proxy\": \"~4.0\",\r\n\"laravel/passport\": \"^6.0\"\r\n\"laravel/laravel\": \"5.6.*\"\r\n\"robmorgan/phinx\": \"~0.10.0\"\r\n\"phpspec/phpspec\": \"~5.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Note for dev: `COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer install --verbose -vvv` we might have to run composer without memory limit\r\n\r\n# 5.6 to 5.7\r\n\r\n[Laravel doc](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/upgrade#upgrade-5.7.0)\r\n\r\n- Dependencies changes:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\"laravel/framework\": \"5.7.*\"\r\n\"laravel/passport\": \"^7.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `public/svg` directory must exist.\r\n- `storage/framework/cache/data` must exist.\r\n- Define public $mockConsoleOutput = false as a property in test class calling artisan i.e Datasource console.\r\n\r\n# 5.7 to 5.8\r\n\r\n[Laravel doc](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/upgrade#upgrade-5.8.0)\r\n\r\n- Dependencies changes:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\"laravel/framework\": \"5.8.*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Replaced `array_pluck` by `Arr::pluck`\r\n- Replaced `array_flatten` by `Arr::flatten`\r\n- Replaced `str_random` by `Str::random`\r\n- Replaced `str_slug` by `Str::slug`\r\n- Changed Cache class methods usage to consider seconds instead of minutes\r\n- The setUp and tearDown methods now require a void return type:\r\n  - Updated the `setUp` method so that its return type is `void` in the `ushahidi/platform/tests/unit` directory.\r\n  - Updated the `tearDown` method so that its return type is `void` in the `ushahidi/platform/tests/unit` directory.\r\n  - Removed redundant `tearDown` method from test classes\r\n- Read-Only env Helper, so putenv doesn't work anymore\r\n- Updated `app/PlatformVerifier/Env.php` to use new syntax of `Dotenv` library: `Dotenv::create()`.\r\n\r\n# 5.8 to 6.0\r\n\r\n[Laravel doc](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/upgrade#upgrade-5.8.0)\r\n\r\n- Dependencies changes:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n    \"laravel/framework\": \"^6.0\"\r\n    \"sentry/sentry-laravel\": \"*\"\r\n    \"laravel/passport\": \"^9.3.2\"\r\n    \"doctrine/dbal\": \"^2.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Replaces sentry config by running `php artisan sentry:publish`\r\n- Change `Event::fire` to `Event::dispatch`\r\n- Added `camel_case` function that wraps around `Str::camel` for backwards compatibility with laravel-ckan-api package as 6.0 doesn't have the `camel_case` helper function anymore.\r\n- The default Redis client has changed from `predis` to `phpredis`. In order to keep using `predis`, ensure the redis.\r\n- Replaced `translator->trans()` method in `KohanaValidationEngine`, `ValidatorTrait` and `ContactRepository` by translator->get()`method as`Illuminate\\Contracts\\Translation\\Translator` changed.\r\n- Replaced `Input::get` by `Request::input` in `Post.php` and `Survey.php` as the `Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Input` facade has been removed.\r\n- Updated `create` method in `platform/app/Passport/ClientRepository.php` to be compatible with new Passport version. It now matches `platform/vendor/laravel/passport/src/ClientRepository.php`\r\n- Updated `createPasswordGrantClient` method in `platform/app/Passport/ClientRepository.php` to be compatible with new Passport version. It now matches `platform/vendor/laravel/passport/src/ClientRepository.php`\r\n- Replaced `League\\OAuth2\\Server\\Exception\\OAuthServerException` by `Laravel\\Passport\\Exceptions\\OAuthServerException` in:\r\n  - `app/Passport/TokenGuard.php`\r\n  - `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`\r\n  - As per [Passport documentation on renderable exceptions](https://github.com/laravel/passport/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#renderable-exceptions-for-oauth-errors)\r\n- Changed `secret` field in `oauth_clients` table as per [Passport documentation on public clients](https://github.com/laravel/passport/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#public-clients): `migrations/20201110132445_update_oauth_clients_table_secret.php`\r\n- Added `provider` field in `oauth_clients` table as per [Passport documentation on multiple guards](https://github.com/laravel/passport/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#support-for-multiple-guards): `migrations/20201110135500_update_oauth_clients_table_providers.php`\r\n- `\"doctrine/dbal\": \"^2.0\"` dependency was added because it was needed to make changes in oauth tables\r\n- Modified `TokenGuard` to use `PsrHttpFactory` instead of `DiactorosFactory` (deprecated). More info [here](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/psr7.html#converting-from-httpfoundation-objects-to-psr-7)\r\n- League Oauth Password Grant throws invalid_grant instead invalid crentials when user authentication fails, which has http status code 400 instead of 401. So, we need to update the `Scenario: Requesting access token with incorrect password fails` in `tests/features/oauth2.feature` to check for 400 status code instead of 401.\r\n  - Similar issue https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server/issues/1059\r\n\r\n# 6.0 to 7.0\r\n\r\n[Laravel doc](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/upgrade#upgrade-6.x)\r\n\r\n- Dependencies changes:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\"laravel/framework\": \"^7.0\"\r\n\"fruitcake/laravel-cors\": \"^2.0\"\r\n\"phpunit/phpunit\": \"^8.5\"\r\n\"nyholm/psr7\": \"^1.5\"\r\n\"asm89/stack-cors\": \"~2.0\"\r\n\"robmorgan/phinx\": \"~0.11.2\"\r\n\"phpspec/phpspec\": \"~7.0\"\r\n\"captainhook/captainhook\": \"^5.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The big deal here is that laravel now relies on symfony 5, so we had to check in all the dependencies how it was affected.\r\n- Updated `report` and `render` methods in `app/Exceptions/Handler.php` so that they take `Throwable` instead of `Exception` as parameters\r\n- Added `\"symfony/psr-http-message-bridge\": \"^2.0\"` as dependency\r\n- Added `nyholm/psr7` as dependency\r\n- Replaced `\"barryvdh/laravel-cors\"` by `\"fruitcake/laravel-cors\"`\r\n  - Replaced `Barryvdh\\Cors\\HandleCors::class` by ` Fruitcake\\Cors\\HandleCors::class` in `app/Http/Kernel.php`\r\n- The optional $delta parameter of assertEquals() is deprecated and will be removed in PHPUnit 9. Refactor your test to use assertEqualsWithDelta() instead.\r\n  - assertAttributeEquals() is deprecated and will be removed in PHPUnit 9.\r\n  - readAttribute() is deprecated and will be removed in PHPUnit 9.\r\n  - getObjectAttribute() is deprecated and will be removed in PHPUnit 9.\r\n- assertInternalType() is deprecated and will be removed in PHPUnit 9. [More info](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3369)\r\n- `dms/phpunit-arraysubset-asserts` supports usage of assertArraySubset(), that is deprecated and will be removed in PHPUnit 9. More info [here](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3494)\r\n- Update Resources to use `Illuminate\\Http\\Resources\\Json\\JsonResource` instead of `Illuminate\\Http\\Resources\\Json\\Resource`\r\n- Update Collections to use `Illuminate\\Http\\Resources\\Json\\ResourceCollection` instead of `Illuminate\\Http\\Resources\\Json\\Resource`\r\n- Replaced `\"sebastianfeldmann/captainhook\"` by `\"captainhook/captainhook\"`\r\n  - Updated `tests/CaptainHook/PHPCS.php` and `captainhook.json` to be compatible with new captainhook version\r\n  - Make sure hooks are installed by running `bin/captainhook install`\r\n- Updated `(Dotenv::create(...))->load();` by\r\n\r\n```\r\n$dotenv = Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__ . '/../');\r\n$dotenv->load();\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the files: `app/PlatformVerifier/Env.php`\r\n\r\n- Removed `\"phpunit/dbunit\": \"~4.0.0\"` depedency there is no compatible version with `\"phpunit/phpunit\": \"^8.5\"`. More on `dbunit` deprecation can be found [here](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/dbunit/issues/217) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/cbmzhw/has_dbunit_been_abandoned_what_are_you_guys_using/).\r\n  - Behat Tests heavily depends on seed data\r\n  - dbunit is used to seed data in behat tests, but unfortunately there is no compatible version with phpunit 8.5\r\n  - We extracted the utility classes from `dbunit` that can be used to seed data in behat tests\r\n  - The future plan is to replace these seeders with laravel factories\r\n\r\n# Benefits\r\n\r\n- Looking foward to using this https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/33025 in the future\r\n\r\n# 7.0 to 8.0\r\n\r\n- Dependencies changes:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\"laravel/framework\": \"^8.0\"\r\n\"laravel/passport\": \"^10.0\",\r\n\"laravel/tinker\": \"^2.5\",\r\n\"guzzlehttp/guzzle\": \"^6.5|^7.0.1\",\r\n\"php-http/curl-client\": \"^2.2\",\r\n\"ushahidi/laravel-ckan-api\": \"dev-master\",\r\n\"vonage/client\": \"^2.3\",\r\n\"fakerphp/faker\": \"^1.9.1\",\r\n\"phpunit/phpunit\": \"^9.0\",\r\n\"nunomaduro/collision\": \"^5.10\",\r\n\"facade/ignition\": \"~2.5\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Guzzle Conflict with v7\r\n  - intercom-php relies on Guzzle v6, so we can use a different HTTP client, for example cURL: [See more](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-php/issues/317)\r\n  - Replace nexmo/client-core with vonage/client-core\r\n    - Update the namespace and reference of these packages in Nexmo datasource plugin\r\n    - Fix failing unit tests\r\n    - Fix failing feature tests\r\n    - [Update] Laravel 8 doesn't really require Guzzle 7, so it's fine to keep using Guzzle 6 also. See more [here](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/pull/5381).\r\n- Remove ramsey/uuid already in laravel 8\r\n- Replaced `germanazo/laravel-ckan-api` with `ushahidi/laravel-ckan-api`\r\n  - The `ushahidi/laravel-ckan-api` package is a fork of `germanazo/laravel-ckan-api` with some fixes and improvements\r\n- Refactored your test code to use assertMatchesRegularExpression() instead of assertRegExp() as it is deprecated and will be removed in PHPUnit 10.\r\n- Refactor your code to use assertDoesNotMatchRegularExpression() instead of assertNotRegExp() as it is deprecated and will be removed in PHPUnit 10.\r\n- Run `./bin/phpunit --migrate-configuration` to migrate your configuration to the new format.\r\n- Seeders and factories are now namespaced. To accommodate for these changes,\r\n  - Added the Database\\Seeders namespace to the seeder classes.\r\n  - Renamed the previous database/seeds directory to database/seeders\r\n\r\n\r\nPing
