Create a file **test.json** with contents `[1,2,3]`.\n2. Run the following testcase:\n\n``` php\nclass JsonTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_Testcase\n{\n  public function testStringString() {\n    $this->assertJsonStringEqualsJsonString('[1,2,3]', '[1,2,3]');\n  }\n  public function testStringFile() {\n    $this->assertJsonStringEqualsJsonFile('test.json', '[1,2,3]');\n  }\n  public function testFileFile() {\n    $this->assertJsonFileEqualsJsonFile('test.json', 'test.json');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe first test passes, while the other 2 fail with message `Failed asserting that '[1,2,3]' matches JSON string \"[1,2,3]\"`.\n#### Fix:\n\nThe problem occurs in **Constraint/JsonMatches.php**:\n\n``` php\n    protected function matches($other)\n    {\n        $decodedOther = json_decode($other);\n        if (!is_object($decodedOther)) {\n            $this->failure_reason = $this->getJsonError();\n            return FALSE;\n        }\n    ...\n```\n\nThis code assumes that an error has occured if `json_decode` does not return an object, but in fact `json_decode` can return other PHP types for valid JSON (e.g. '[1,2,3]' returns an array).  A call to `json_last_error` should be used to reliably determine if an error has occurred.  In fact, this is what `assertJsonStringEqualsJsonString` does, which explains why the 1st test passes.  `assertJsonStringEqualsJsonString` does not make use of JsonMatches constraint, for reasons that are not entirely clear to me.  Perhaps it should be rewritten to be consistent with the other Json assertions?\n","closed_by":{"login":"edorian","id":247397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian","html_url":"https://github.com/edorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edorian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/709/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
