PR includes:\r\n\r\n* [x] Compatibility with PHP 7.3, 7.4 & 8.0 as well as Composer 2.0\r\n* [x] Replacement of `var_export` by `serialize()` for the generated `BundleDescriber` class to avoid circular references\r\n* [x] Support for GitHub actions as possible replacement for Travis CI\r\n\r\n**:warning: Since extensive adaptions were made, this PR comes as breaking change for the current code base.**\r\n\r\n## Version matrix\r\n\r\n| | PHP 8.0 | PHP 7.4 | PHP 7.3 | PHP 7.2 | PHP 7.1 |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Composer 1.x | 0.5.x | 0.5.x | 0.5.x | 0.1.0 - 0.5.x | 0.1.0 - 0.5.x\r\n| Composer 2.x | 0.5.x | 0.5.x | 0.5.x | 0.5.x | 0.5.x |\r\n\r\nThe support for various versions is possible because `ocramius/package-versions` is now replaced by `composer/package-versions-deprecated` which does exactly the same besides the fact that it supports a wider range of platform versions.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should keep in mind that the packages' name describes the actual state of the package: it's deprecated (but still supported). I'd suggest to keep it for now and remove the dependency once Composer 2.x has became established. We can then focus on the [class generation provided by Composer]((https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/InstalledVersions.php)).\r\n\r\n## Serialization\r\n\r\nSince `var_export` cannot handle circular references (which is the case for the currently used installed packages objects), an alternative needed to be found. It turned out that serialization might be a good choice for now as it store the whole object/array representation and is also able to handle circular references.\r\n\r\nAs a result, `var_export` has now been replaced by `serialize()`. The `PropertyTrait` and `InstalledPackagesTrait` have been adapted to resolve all serialized occurrences on first access.\r\n\r\n## GitHub actions\r\n\r\nThis project now supports GitHub actions next to Travis CI. It would be great if we can get rid of Travis CI if it turns out that GitHub actions fulfill all our requirements:\r\n\r\n* Test all supported combinations of PHP & Composer versions\r\n* Collect test results and send them to

in the v1 branch\r\nc. support both versions in a single code base by switching class definitions with phpversion()\r\n\r\nThe following examples will show you why it is difficult to support both PHP7
