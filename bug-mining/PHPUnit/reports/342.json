The issue is closed but looking at the [doRun function](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/src/TextUI/TestRunner.php#L148) and its [callee in the same class](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/src/TextUI/TestRunner.php#L91), there appears to be a missing argument there which causes the aformentioned PHP warnings. In my experience, both CircleCI and Codeship execute the tests through that callee and I see the warning messages. Locally though on my laptop, the `doRun` function is executed from the [Command.php](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/src/TextUI/Command.php#L159) file, where the `$exit` parameter is provided and I therefore don't see any warnings.\n\nLooks to me either the erroneous calling function needs to be changed, or the `$exit` parameter should be given a default. I don't know which is more appropriate. I can make a PR if someone enlightens me with the proper solution :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/2094/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
