When I compare two large objects or collections (typically Doctrine 2 entities or collections of Doctrine 2 entities which contain EntityManager), PHPUnit often fails on memory limit or freeze my system for a few minutes and even after that does not print 'expected' and 'actual' results.\n\nThere should be a limit for number of dumped rows so I can figure out what went wrong. I don't have to see all 10 thousands object attributes.\n\nIf you're going to tell me that I should compare smaller objects, I have my reasons for it. For example I need to test my implementation against data in a large XML etc.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/119/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
