Then stops coverage. At this point, normally data about the file would be picked up and processed.\r\n- However, unknown to php-code-coverage that file *was* already included/required earlier on during the test run. Therefore the `include_once` is actually a no-op, resulting in the coverage driver not reading/parsing/outputting any data about the file.\r\n\r\nIf *any* other test in a test suite (without `@coversNothing`) invoked that source code file in any way during execution I think it would show up in the report just fine, as the driver would then include data for it at that point","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1084480942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dvdoug","id":1571110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzExMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1571110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug","html_url":"https://github.com/dvdoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/1084480945","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4947#issuecomment-1084480945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4947","id":1084480945,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbWLc5Ao92x","user":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-24T06:10:21Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T06:19:19Z","body":"That makes sense.
