This may cause problems later on. For example flow3 stores something like \"[...]CLASS[....]some_name\" after halt-compiler and phpunit seems to interpret this as a new class but withou end ('endLine' won't be set ever). See http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/flow3-general/2010-October/000603.html for details and possible fix.
