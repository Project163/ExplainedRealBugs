I suggest you upgrade your project's composer.json accordingly -- you'll find that things will be much smoother. If there is some particular reason to stay with PHPUnit 3.6.x, you probably need to specify all of the PEAR packages PHPUnit is dependent upon in your composer.json, not just PHPUnit. That way you can fix upon a working version combination and stay with it.\n\nHowever, I recommend using this opportunity to upgrade to 3.7.x and get on a supported installation
