somewhat late to the game here, but I agree with @andrewnicols's philosophy on coverage, and this is already blocking me from upgrading to 9.x due to (presumably) some change in the docblock parser that was probably related to plans for this. I'll assume for discussion purposes that breakage is a bug, but it would be just as relevant in the future if this happens for PHPUnit 10.\r\n\r\nMy tests all start off with the following:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @coversDefaultClass Company\\Project\\My\r\n * @covers ::<protected>\r\n * @covers ::<private>\r\n */\r\nclass MyTest extends \\PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase\r\n{\r\n```\r\n\r\nTests can and do figure out whether the internals of my code are sound, and the coverage reports confirm as much. Test cases interact with the public APIs, and exercise logic that's contained in the public and private APIs. The coverage reports for public APIs must be explicit, and anything internal is an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it's actively harmful for tests to be forced to know which private/protected methods any public API uses for the purpose of generating coverage reports, but as of the [docs for 9.3](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.3/annotations.html#covers), the only _recommended_ way to annotate coverage is class-wide; even covering specific class methods is explicitly \"not recommended\".\r\n\r\nSo while my gut reaction is that this isn't entirely a good direction to go, I'm open to alternatives. Maybe the best practices in the documentation could be made clearer? My current approach is based on a test generator skeleton that probably dates back to PHPUnit 4 or so. It would be really nice to not introduce code churn on thousands of test files in an upgrade, but if there's a better way I'll deal with it.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: I have no issue with dropping `<public>` support, or equivalents. There's a lot of value in being explicit about which part(s) of the public API a unit test is covering. But being able to either implicitly or explicitly cover any part of the private API (whether via `<!public>` or `<private>` or something else) seems like a fundamental goal of proper encapsulation.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/comments/677982647/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Firehed","id":354842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDg0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/354842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed","html_url":"https://github.com/Firehed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Firehed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3677639318,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzY3NzYzOTMxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/3677639318","actor":{"login":"andrewnicols","id":370047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/370047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewnicols","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-21T01:10:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3677639320,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2Nzc2MzkzMjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/events/3677639320","actor":{"login":"andrewnicols","id":370047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/370047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewnicols","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewnicols/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-21T01:10:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sebastianbergmann","id":25218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianbergmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-02T12:20:03Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T12:20:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4478","rep

Summary\r\n\r\nUsing the `@covers ::<!public>` annotation on an exception causes a PHP fatal error. Presumably other variations of this annotation are broken as well.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ php -f phpunit-9.4.phar -- --coverage-filter myexceptiontest.php --coverage-text

error.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @covers myexception::__construct\r\n * @covers myexception::<!public>\r\n */\r\nfinal class myexceptiontest extends \\PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase\r\n{\r\n    public function test()\r\n    {\r\n        $e = new myexception();\r\n        self::assertSame('Hi', $e->getMessage());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass myexception extends \\exception\r\n{\r\n    public function __construct(\\Throwable $previous = null)\r\n    {\r\n        parent::__construct('Hi', 0, $previous);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun PHPUnit with these arguments:\r\n\r\n```\r\nphpunit --coverage-filter myexceptiontest.php --coverage-text myexceptiontest.php  \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears PHPUnit is trying to find the source file of the final private method `\\Exception::__clone`, the correct behaviour I believe is to ignore parent methods.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n9.0 exhibits the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$

Commenting/CoversTag: add some extra tests\r\n\r\n... for situations previously not (yet) covered by tests.\r\n\r\n### Commenting/CoversTag: minor tweaks\r\n\r\n* Ensure (make it obvious) that `$data` is always available.\r\n* Use the correct data type for the stack pointers retrieved via the `explode()`.\r\n* Defense in depth tweak.\r\n* Improve the readability of the code a little.\r\n\r\n### Commenting/CoversTag: make non-interface methods private\r\n\r\nAs the sniff class is now `final` (since PR #319), there is no need for any `protected` methods, so let's make these `private`.\r\n\r\n### Commenting/CoversTag: improve XML documentation\r\n\r\nUpdate external reference links and minor textual improvements.\r\n\r\n### Commenting/CoversTag: bug fix - allow for `<[!]visibility>` format without class name\r\n\r\nThis is perfectly valid when used in combination with a `@coversDefaultClass` class level tag, but would be flagged by the sniff (false positives).\r\n\r\nFixed now. Includes tests.\r\n\r\n### Commenting/CoversTag: flag deprecated `@covers` tag formats\r\n\r\nPHPUnit 9.0 (soft) deprecated the use of `ClassName<*>` type `@covers` annotations. Support for these type of annotation has been removed completely in PHPUnit 10.0.0.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a new _warning_ to the sniff, which will detect the use of these deprecated formats and flag them.\r\n\r\nThe choice for _warning_ vs _error_ is deliberate. The Yoast repos, for now, do not use PHPUnit 10.x yet, so for now, a warning is sufficient.\r\nOnce the repos would be upgraded to start using PHPUnit 10.x, this sniff should be updated and the `warning` changed to an `error`.\r\n\r\nIncludes tests.\r\nIncludes a new section in the XML docs about this new warning.\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#3630 (PHPUnit 9.0 deprecation).\r\n* sebastianbergmann/phpunit#3631 (PHPUnit 10.0 removal).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Yoast/yoastcs/issues/330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Yoast/yoastcs/issues/330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
