I can confirm that other prefixes do indeed work.\n\nI guess it makes sense to align with SPARQL syntax, though it's worth noting that this query appears to conform to the SPARQL grammar, as I understand it (and it seems to parse in sesame):\n\n``` sparql\nPREFIX graph: <http://foo/> \n\nSELECT * WHERE { \n   GRAPH graph:bar { \n      ?s ?p ?o \n    }\n}\n```\n\nGiven this (and assuming the above is legal), and the implied alignment goal of TriG to a subset of SPARQL syntax, it seems to me that Trig should definitely parse this too, as erroring will lead to undesirable incompatibilities between prefixes and serialisations.\n\nIf the W3C say that a prefix of `graph` is reserved then it would obviously be better for the writer and parser to raise an error immediately rather than emitting it or parsing it as
