This order prevents a PrettyWriter-like handler from creating a readable syntax. This can be seen in the repository manager that reads in configuration templates and writes them back out in the order the statements were parsed. This is also a problem for writing to the federation. Since all statements of a BNodes can only exist in one members and some members maybe configured to only accept certain subject URIs, it is important to know which resources will link to the BNode before adding it to a member. This can be fixed by changing the method parseImplicitBlank to take a BNode as a parameter and calling it after the first statement (s, p, BNode) has been reported.\n","closed_by":{"login":"catch-point","id":881923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTkyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/881923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point","html_url":"https://github.com/catch-point","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catch-point/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
