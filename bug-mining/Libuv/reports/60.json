This is just a starting point, let's work through it and I'll make a proper PR:\n\n---\n# Supported platforms\n\n| System | Support type | Supported versions | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GNU/Linux | Tier 1 | Linux >= 2.6.18 with glibc >= 2.5 |  |\n| macOS | Tier 1 | macOS >= 10.7 |  |\n| Windows | Tier 1 | Windows >= XP SP1 | MSVC 2008 and later are supported |\n| FreeBSD | Tier 1 | >= 9 |  |\n| AIX | Tier 2 | ??? | Maintainer: @iWuzHere |\n| zOS | Tier 2 | ??? | Maintainer: @jBarz |\n| Linux with musl | Tier 2 | ??? |  |\n| SunOS | Tier 3 | ??? |  |\n| MinGW | Tier 3 | MinGW 32 (from mingw.org) and MinGW-w64 |  |\n| Other | Tier 3 | N/A |  |\n## Support types\n- Tier 1: Officially supported and tested with CI. Any contributed patch MUST NOT break such systems. These are supported by @libuv/collaborators \n- Tier 2: Officially supported, but not necessarily tested with CI. These systems are maintained to the best of @libuv/collaborators ability, without being a top priority.\n- Tier 3: Community maintained. These systems may inadvertently break and the community and interested parties are expected to help with the maintenance.\n\n---\n\nThis is for v1.x, I'll adjust accordingly for master / v2.x. I also took the liberty of making SunOS tier 2. Joyent should keep it in check IMHO.\n","closed_by":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
