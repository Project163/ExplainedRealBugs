 people (even seasoned developers) get thrown off by our documentation, let's try to fix that!\n- [ ] Add descriptions of what each funcion does, aside from linking the man page\n- [ ] Add an example for each handle at the top of its file, and for the individual function after their description\n- [ ] Add a \"getting started\" section\n- [ ] Document parameters and possible return values for all functions (the UDP docs are a good example though it can still be improved further)\n- [ ] Evaluate our relationship with the uvbook: see if we can collaborate somehow, in case we want to add parts of it to our docs\n- [ ] Find a Sphinx theme (or adapt an existing one) to be mobile friendly: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/801\n- [ ] Add some more examples: a simple HTTP client which sends \"hello\" using http_parser, a \"micro netcat\", (other suggestions are welcome)\n\nThis is an ongoing effort, those who want to contribute to it are welcome to do so, please leave a note here so we know who is working on what.

there, \n\nI'm still getting familiar with the codebase etc. I just wanted to make sure I'm on the right path.\n\nThus far I've [removed](https://github.com/jessicaquynh/libuv/commit/94bc9caa5b15dc39d9d67ab17618719c6e69ff59) `suggested_size` from the typedef. And I'm working on removing the parameter from the `src` and `tests`; but I am encountering allocation failures on the tests where I've replaced the suggested size with 65536. \n\nPerhaps it's not as simple as this implementation. If anyone can shed light on this, I'd very much appreciate
