I've got some good news, I've figured out the cause of the race condition.  `fs_event_watch_dir` uses `fs_event_create_files` to create some files, which drives the tests, and then schedules a timer to cleanup after itself.  What can happen is you can end up with the cleanup callback _(`fs_event_unlink_files`)_ running prior to all of the `fs_event` handler callbacks _(as a result of the files being created)_ being processed.  This is not the only race condition.  The cleanup callback itself removes files, creating more `fs_event`, and then schedules another timer whose callback _(`fs_event_create_files`)_ can run prior to all of the removal events being processed.\n\nThis will leave some `fs_event` handlers not having completed which keeps the event loop open, hence the timeout.  `fs_event_watch_dir_recursive` is also flaky and happens to use the same testing logic so I think we should be able to fix both flaky tests in one pass using the same approach.\n\nMy plan is to refactor the tests to not use timers so this can be avoided.  Once I've got this working, I will submit a PR.  The way I validated this was keeping track of each of these callbacks, their order and such.  I noticed that when things failed, not all `fs_event` handlers were processed.  I bumped up the timers involved to use a timeout of `200ms` instead of `50ms` and the failures went away.  I can run both flaky tests 1000 times without failure, where I use to run somewhere around 10 before I got the first failure.  Below is the diff of my current changes which show this is clearly a timing issue:\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/test/test-fs-event.c b/test/test-fs-event.c\nindex f6c2214..245e550 100644\n---

What can happen is you can end up with the cleanup callback (fs_event_unlink_files) running prior to all of the fs_event handler callbacks (as a result of the files being created) being processed\n\nHow is this possible, if removing the files always happens 50ms after they where all created? I guess it's possible that if you create a file and remove it in less than 50ms you lose the event?\n\nFor this particular test, maybe we shouldn't have `fs_event_unlink_files` create more files after they have been removed.\n\n> My plan is to refactor the tests to not use timers so this can be avoided. Once I've got this working, I will submit a PR. The way I validated this was keeping track of each of these callbacks, their order and such.\n\nSounds like a plan!

and `fs_event_watch_dir_recursive` could fail randomly\ndue to the way in which the tests were written.  Originally timers were\nused to create, remove and recreate the test files but this could lead\nto a race condition if the timeout used to delete the test files ran\nbefore all file creation fs events were handled.  On top of that, the\nfile removal timer scheduled another timer to recreate the test files\nand that timer's timeout could also lead to the same condition.\n\nThe refactoring removed timers for the removal/recreation of the test\nfiles and instead the fs event callback was updated to have the\nnecessary logic to drive the test file removal.  We no longer recreate\nthe test files since it appears to be unnecessary.\n\nWith the current PR, I can run 1000 tests for `fs_event_watch_dir` and\n`fs_event_watch_dir_recursive` without a single failure, where prior to this\nPR they would fail 14/100 on average.\n\nFixes #30\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":383032405,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4MzAzMjQwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/events/383032405","actor":{"login":"whitlockjc","id":98899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc","html_url":"https://github.com/whitlockjc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitlockjc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7153f4520b36ba38034d69cc4a27c3e9aef4624f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/whitlockjc/libuv/commits/7153f4520b36ba38034d69cc4a27c3e9aef4624f","created_at":"2015-08-14T22:17:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
