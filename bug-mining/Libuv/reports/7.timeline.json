Is it possible I'm unintentionally ignoring some error status and causing this?\n\nThanks for any suggestions.

linux as well. I haven't tried in other platforms, but looking at the problem symptom, looks like this will fail in all 64 bit platforms with weakly consistent memory models (such as amd, ppc)\n\n**Recreate**\nhttps://github.com/gireeshpunathil/libuvcrashasync\n\nfoo.cc has the main addon code. Please ignore some unrealistic stuff in the code (such as randomizer thread, tight loop in the worker threads etc.), they are added only to bring about the problem faster.

While the API documentation on async messages [about](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/async.html) thread safety of these interactions, I don't see sufficient provision for multi-thread data access primitives (such as mutexes, memory barriers etc. ) in libuv data structures to support this.\n\nb. The code may be seen as re-registering new async events for the same listener, and the crash is avoided if we do registration once and async_send as many times. But in real scenario, this re-registration may be new registrations with different listeners, and when the number of threads as well as their frequency of new async registration increases, the multi-thread loop data access increases, and increases the chance of corruption.\n\nThanks in advance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"esxgx","id":1145922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDU5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1145922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx","html_url":"https://github.com/esxgx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esxgx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T05:07:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T05:07:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/842","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/842/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/842/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/842/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/842","id":150680980,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTA2ODA5ODA=","number":842,"title":"win:
