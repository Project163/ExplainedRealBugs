Even if you just do `process.stdin.setRawMode(true)`, the mere initialization inside the process.stdin getter runs this code https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/c490b8ba54df6c730f7bfd02aaafe7c34f571f9e/src/node.js#L665-L716. \n\nThe first line in that range triggers a line buffered read, with the following code path:\n\n```\n\n    node.exe!uv_tty_queue_read_line(uv_loop_s * loop, uv_tty_s * handle) Line 488   C\n    node.exe!uv_tty_queue_read(uv_loop_s * loop, uv_tty_s * handle) Line 507    C\n    node.exe!uv_tty_read_start(uv_tty_s * handle, void (uv_handle_s *, unsigned int, uv_buf_t *) * alloc_cb, void (uv_stream_s *, int, const uv_buf_t *) * read_cb) Line 937    C\n    node.exe!uv_read_start(uv_stream_s * handle, void (uv_handle_s *, unsigned int, uv_buf_t *) * alloc_cb, void (uv_stream_s *, int, const uv_buf_t *) * read_cb) Line 89  C\n    node.exe!node::StreamWrap::ReadStart() Line 129 C++\n    node.exe!node::StreamBase::ReadStart(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value> & args) Line 41  C++\n    node.exe!node::StreamBase::JSMethod<node::StreamWrap,&node::StreamBase::ReadStart>(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value> & args) Line 117   C++\n     [...]\n    at ReadStream.Socket._read (net.js:398:10)\n    at ReadStream.Readable.read (_stream_readable.js:336:10)\n    at ReadStream.Socket.read (net.js:289:43)\n    at ReadStream.Socket (net.js:171:12)\n    at new ReadStream (tty.js:27:14)\n    at process.stdin (node.js:665:19)\n```\n\n..and the last line cancels the read, in:\n\n```\n    node.exe!uv_tty_read_stop(uv_tty_s * handle) Line 989   C\n    node.exe!uv_read_stop(uv_stream_s * handle) Line 107    C\n    node.exe!node::StreamWrap::ReadStop() Line 134  C++\n    node.exe!node::StreamBase::ReadStop(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value> & args) Line 46   C++\n    node.exe!node::StreamBase::JSMethod<node::StreamWrap,&node::StreamBase::ReadStop>(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value> & args) Line 117    C++\n     [...]\n    at process.stdin (node.js:716)\n```\n\nThe bug in Node started appearing much more frequently after a c-ares update. My best theory is that the c-ares update caused a change in the timing in Node's startup, in which turn causes the problematic side of the race condition to win the race more often.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/217847072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"orangemocha","id":1625870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjU4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1625870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha","html_url":"https://github.com/orangemocha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":654295571,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjU0Mjk1NTcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/events/654295571","actor":{"login":"piscisaureus","id":218257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODI1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus","html_url":"https://github.com/piscisaureus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-05-09T12:09:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":654295572,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDY1NDI5NTU3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/events/654295572","actor":{"login":"piscisaureus","id":218257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODI1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus","html_url":"https://github.com/piscisaureus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piscisaureus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-05-09T12:09:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/217848017","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/852#issuecomment-217848017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/852","id":217848017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzg0ODAxNw==","user":{"login":"orangemocha","id":1625870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjU4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1625870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha","html_url":"https://github.com/orangemocha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemocha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"p

the handle does not make `ReadConsoleW` exit reliably on Windows 7 and above. Thus, after switching from line to raw mode, keypresses were held until enter was pressed. This has caused a number of issues in node: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2504 , https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2996, https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/5384 , https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/5821 , https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/5940 .\n\nThis fix makes `ReadConsoleW` exit by writing a return keypress to its input buffer, similar to what was already done for raw mode. The second commit removes the duplicate handle that was used to close the console before. The third commit restores the cursor position to where it was before writing the enter, because `ReadConsoleW` echoes the newline in the screen.\n\nThis PR includes a test that switches the console to raw mode and uses `WriteConsoleInputW` to test reading in raw mode. I do not know of a unix equivalent to `WriteConsoleInputW`, so the test is for Windows only. In this test, switching to raw mode is done after a 100 ms sleep, to allow `uv_tty_line_read_thread` to reach [`ReadConsoleW`](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/e397caa3a6a139fff2fed06e0223ee92582fa2d2/src/win/tty.c#L422).\n\nThe added `User32` library is necessary for [`MapVirtualKeyW`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646306).\n\nFixes: libuv/libuv#852\n\ncc @saghul @piscisaureus \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/866/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":7,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/219368354","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/852#issuecomment-219368354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/852","id":219368354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTM2ODM1NA==","user":{"login":"DrPizza","id":301404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTQwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/301404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza","html_url":"https://github.com/DrPizza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPizza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T07:47:15Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T07:47:15Z","body":"The Windows 10 update coming some time later this year makes changes of some kind to the console subsystem (the background being the new Linux subsystem which at the very least needs Windows to be as good as a vt100, sigh).

should be a convenient and standard way to read and write from the trio process's stdin/stdout/stderr streams. (Note that this is different from talking to the stdin/stdout/stderr of child processes, which is part of #4.) Probably this should use our standard stream abstraction.\r\n\r\nComplications to consider:\r\n\r\nNormally Python's I/O stack does a bunch of work here: text/binary conversion, newline conversion, buffering, convenience parsing things like `readline` and line iteration. (I think that's it - anything else?) We have to decide whether we want to re-use it (basically doing `run_in_worker_thread` for everything) or reimplement the parts we want. `{Send,Receive,}TextStream` classes seems like a reasonable thing to provide in general, and they should probably implement universal newline support too, why not. (Not sure we even need ABCs for these - they could just be concrete classes? though I suppose someone might eventually come up with a situation where they have an object that natively acts like this without any underlying binary stream, and want to explicitly declare that the interface is the same.) Buffering I'm somewhat dubious of – when applied to stdin/stdout/stderr it often causes user-visible problems (delayed output), it's redundant with buffering done by the kernel (as usual), and we try to minimize it in general. It's particularly bad if you want to speak some automated interactive protocol over stdin/stdout, which seems like a case that might come up in trio relatively often. And convenience parsing (`readline` etc.) might be better handled using sans-IO style protocol objects?\r\n\r\nIt might even make sense to do both; #20 might mean that we have a 3 line solution for the \"wrap an `io.TextIOWrapper` object\" approach if that's what you want, and then also provide a lower-level more-direct stream-based API.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, ~~the *only* reliable way to do non-blocking I/O to the standard streams is via threads. In particular, it's the only thing that works if we're connected to a regular console. Everywhere else, non-blocking I/O is possible (and the sensible thing if we do decide to cut out Python's `io` stack).~~ Edit: See [update below](https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/174#issuecomment-310262200).\r\n\r\nOn Windows, you often have to do these separate console control calls for things like cursor movement and coloring text, which need to be synchronized with the output stream. (In the very very latest Win 10 update they finally added VT100 support to the console, but it will be a while before anyone can count on that.) I believe that the output is still binary (UTF-16) rather than using some kind of first-class text read/write API.\r\n\r\nI know prompt_toolkit has an async API and they support a lot of fancy terminal stuff in pure Python - we should check what they need to make sure whatever we come up with matches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-trio/trio/issues/174/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-trio/trio/issues/174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ihnorton","id":327706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzcwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/327706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton","html_url":"https://github.com/ihnorton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihnorton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-22T03:07:04Z","updated_at":"2019-08-22T03:07:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaLang/julia/issues/32198","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaLang/julia","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaLang/julia/issues/32198/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaLang/julia/issues/32198/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaLang/julia/issues/32198/events","html_url":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/32198","id":450563851,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTA1NjM4NTE=","number":32198,"title":"Interactive

**Version**: v10.0.0\r\n* **Platform**: Windows 10\r\n* **Subsystem**: repl?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Open command prompt or powershell\r\n2. Type `node` and then press enter\r\n3. Write some code\r\n4. Press left arrow on the keyboard <kbd>←</kbd>\r\n5. The console cursor becomes invisible for a second\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nThe cursor should be visible immediatelly after moving (to the left or to the right). For example, command prompt automatically displays the cursor after it has been moved. The cursor has blink rate, but after user moves it, it should be visible no matter if at the given moment the blink rate timeout suggest that it should be visible or invisible.\r\n\r\n### What went wrong?\r\n\r\nAfter moving, the cursor becomes hidden. It makes navigating through the code very hard. Users need to wait one second after moving in order to find out where the cursor currently is. Using <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd> helps a bit skipping whole words, but it is still very hard to navigate if the code is large.\r\n\r\n### Is it a problem with Node.js itself?\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure it is. The reason I think it is Node.js issue and not issue with command prompt is because other programs which provide REPL functionalities properly display the cursor after moving (reset the cursor blink rate to visible state). For example, Python 3.6 properly handles it.\r\n\r\n### Did this work before?\r\n\r\nI think no.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues/20348/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues/20348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
