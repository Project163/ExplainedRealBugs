If so, I suggest replacing the text \"within a short period of time\" with \"for the given async handle\", making it clearer that the strongest guarantee made is that the callback will be executed once, ever.\n\nNo. At least on Unix, `uv_async_send` will mark the handle as \"pending\" using atomic ops and when the callback is executed it's unmarked. As a result, if the callback was called, next time you call `uv_async_send` you'll get the callback called again. If you call `uv_async_send` 5 times in a row, however, it's only guaranteed that your callback is called once.\n\n> If uv_async_send actually makes stronger guarantees, then please document them precisely. For example, a useful stronger guarantee would be that the callback is executed consistent with a model where uv_async_send atomically sets a \"needs execution\" flag, and the event loop atomically resets this flag before running the callback. That would rule out the sequence of execution above.\n\nAsync handles don't have strong guarantees, that's the whole point. People have used async handles to try to send data from one thread to the loop thread by attaching a void\\* data pointer to the request and calling `uv_async_send`. This doesn't work and won't work for the reasons I mention above. The _only_ guarantee is that your callback will be called once, but once the callback is called the story begins again.\n\nIf you feel this can be fursther clarified please do send a PR with a fix for the documentation.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/65551186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/65554705","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/29#issuecomment-65554705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/29","id":65554705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTU0NzA1","user":{"login":"txdv","id":116642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv","html_url":"https://github.com/txdv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-04T09:02:40Z","updated_at":"2014-12-04T09:02:40Z","body":"Can't
