Nixpkgs has a lot of new incoming Pull Requests, but not enough people to review this constant stream. Even if you aren't a committer, we would appreciate reviews of other PRs, especially simple ones like package updates.

allowed.\r\n- Fix iOS and Android

`# uv_run_tests_a: /home/runner/work/libuv/libuv/src/unix/core.c:255: uv__finish_close: Assertion `!(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSED)' failed.`\r\n\r\n~~I think that's a double close of the `tcp_server` handle in test/test-ip.c. `send_handle_and_close()` is called twice when enough data queues up:~~ - maybe, maybe not. Plays fast and loose with globals at any rate.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/1032527238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bnoordhuis","id":275871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis","html_url":"https://github.com/bnoordhuis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/1032555945","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/2307#issuecomment-1032555945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/2307","id":1032555945,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOIGQ849i42p","user":{"login":"bnoordhuis","id":275871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis","html_url":"https://github.com/bnoordhuis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T12:28:18Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T12:28:18Z","body":"My system appears to be too fast to hit the `channel.write_queue_size > 0` code path reliably.\r\n\r\nI observe that sometimes the `ASSERT_EQ(status, UV_EBADF)` in `closed_handle_write_cb()` fails because `status == 0`, i.e., the write completes before the `channel` handle is closed.\r\n\r\nI've been poking at the test for 30 minutes now and I'm increasingly of the opinion that it's very rickety.
