Openssl packages can be installed unattended in appveyor using \"/silent /verysilent /sp- /suppressmsgboxes\".\n\nCan we maybe enable unattended install options in the installer so I can use them in appveyor?  Or is there another way?\n\nThanks.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lws-team","id":15154525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTU0NTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15154525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team","html_url":"https://github.com/lws-team","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lws-team/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/871/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
