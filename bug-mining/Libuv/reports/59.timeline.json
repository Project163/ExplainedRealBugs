@saghul,\n\nI assumed even that the values for WSAPROTOCOL_INFO could just be a hard-coded, but after reading the docs again I'm not quite sure. But certainly the values should be looked up only once and then be cached.\n\nI think you need to look up only two providers (tcp and udp). The third one mentioned in poll.c is for raw/ip sockets but libuv doesn't support creating those.\n\nLast but not least, I would recommend avoiding ANSI-based APIs and to always explicitly use unicode variants. Practically speaking, use struct WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW and create sockets with WSASocketW.\n\n👾
