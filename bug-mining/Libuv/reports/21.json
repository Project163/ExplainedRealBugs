Nevertheless, I need to keep now 2 sets of error codes, windows error codes and UNIX error codes.\n\nIt did work before as far as I recall (the Windows error codes were probably mapped to the UNIX error codes).\n\nI don't know what to do. Should I create another set of error codes in my C# project so I can use them accordingly under the different systems? Or maybe a libuv function which translates them to UNIX error codes?\n","closed_by":{"login":"txdv","id":116642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv","html_url":"https://github.com/txdv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
