Our position is that we are unlikely to integrate TLS in libuv itself but we are open to hosting external contributions under the libuv umbrella in the https://github.com/libuv/libuv-extras repository.\n\nThe problem I see with TLS in libuv core is that we either say \"we only support openssl\" (or gnutls, or nss, or gskit, or mbedtls, or wolfssl, or...) or we write a leaky abstraction layer.\n\nIt's already difficult enough to paper over the differences between openssl, libressl and boringssl that I'm skeptical it would work for libraries without a shared heritage.\n\nlibcurl does it but libcurl ruthlessly trades features for interoperability and even then it's mostly about making other libraries look like openssl.\n\nThe bar for libuv should be higher: it's not interesting to me personally until it's a mostly drop-in replacement for the tls module in node.js.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/259094112/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bnoordhuis","id":275871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis","html_url":"https://github.com/bnoordhuis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":851236628,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDg1MTIzNjYyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/events/851236628","actor":{"login":"bnoordhuis","id":275871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis","html_url":"https://github.com/bnoordhuis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-08T09:58:20Z","label":{"name":"feature-request","color":"fad8c7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/259171316","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/1128#issuecomment-259171316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/1128","id":259171316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTE3MTMxNg==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-08T15:42:10Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T00:13:28Z","body":">

and [this](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/100) has happened almost 10 years ago, so I am thinking about opening the discussion again. I know that you have rejected the idea before, but perhaps the landscape has changed since? The world has moved to \"everything encrypted\" with big tech trampling over the small guys. I believe a solid and maintained support for TLS and QUIC directly in the libuv would be helpful to multiple parties and perhaps it would ease the integration of these encrypted protocols into more applications.\n\nHaving direct support for TLS and QUIC in libuv would mean a huge simplification for DNS over TLS and DNS over QUIC. We would still have to integrate DNS over HTTP(s), but it would be just an easy layer on top of the protocol below. We (ISC) can contribute parts of the code that we already have in BIND 9 if that helps and we can also sponsor the work (see below).\n\nOpenSSL 3.6.0 now has support for QUIC in some form, and personally, I have absolutely no problem with saying \"we only support OpenSSL 3.0.0+ for TLS and OpenSSL 3.6.0+\". If anyone wants to support more libraries, they should put the money where the mouth is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/4916/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/4916/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
