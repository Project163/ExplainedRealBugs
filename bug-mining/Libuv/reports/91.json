The impact as described there is that nodejs on Windows is unable to load script files from a \"Macintosh HD\" network share. (Spaces in the share name are actually irrelevant, despite the issue title.)\n\nFrom debugging I found that the call to `DeviceIoControl(..., FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT, ...)` in `fs__readlink_handle()` results in `ERROR_NOT_A_REPARSE_POINT` specifically for the \"Macintosh HD\" share, but not for any normal network shares. It appears the file handle has `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT` set on it, but does not actually have any reparse data set for it.\n\nWhile it's a bit of a corner case, we know it is impacting several users. I think the fix to `fs__stat_handle` will be straightforward: check for `ERROR_NOT_A_REPARSE_POINT` and in that case treat the file as if `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT` was not there.\n\nI'll submit a PR shortly.\n","closed_by":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/995/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/995/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
