Might be a security liability in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe could shift responsibility to the caller:\r\n```c\r\nstruct sockaddr_in6 s;\r\ns.sin6_scope_id = -1;  /* Sentinel value. */\r\nint r = uv_ip6_addr(\"::0%bad\", 0, &s);\r\nassert(r == 0);  /* OK */\r\nassert(s.sin6_scope_id == 0);  /* OK, indicates error. */\r\n```\r\nThe upside is that it lets callers parse bad link-local addresses, the downside is that it's more laborious and therefore easier to forget about proper validation.  It should be documented, though, if we decide to take this approach.","closed_by":{"login":"cjihrig","id":2512748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2512748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig","html_url":"https://github.com/cjihrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjihrig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/1313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/1313/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
