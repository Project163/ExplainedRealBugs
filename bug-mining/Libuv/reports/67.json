The callback will be called over-and-over again, AS LONG AS the given fd/socket is still readable/writable (depending on the given events given to poll). Particullary in each of the following scenerios:\n   (a) The callback did not conduct a read/write at all when the socket is readable/writable.\n   (b) The callback made a read on the socket, and have not read all the available data. or the callback made a write but the socket remained writable afterwards.\n   (c) The socket has already became readable/writable before even starting the poll handle on this socket, and since then the state of the socket did not changed.\n   In all of the above listed scenerios, the socket remains readable/writable and hence the callback will be called again.\n2. It state that after stopping the poll handle, the callback will not be called. I think it is important to mentaion that it won't be called even if the socket has already become readable/writable before the handle was stopped, and the callback event was already pending.\n\nReference to posts in the mailing list:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libuv/3COSl39ZkEY\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libuv/n-m0KBz0-fo\n\nElad.\n","closed_by":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/1078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/1078/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
