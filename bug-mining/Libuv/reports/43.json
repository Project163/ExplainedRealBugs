In libev these watchers are high perf and can use e.g. epoll. The libuv documentation warns about poor performance of uv_poll_t and much points towards it using poll as implementation.\n\nThis means my work in creating a Node.js wrapper for a high perf libev server is impossible without completely rewriting the original server to use uv_tcp_t, which is not going to happen.\n\nWill you support epoll (and friends)?\n","closed_by":{"login":"bnoordhuis","id":275871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis","html_url":"https://github.com/bnoordhuis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/704/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
