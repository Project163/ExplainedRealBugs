If I move all the files out of the watched directories and leave just one file, it fails on syntax error just fine without a segfault. If I add two, three, four files with just a few imports, it's still fine. But then I add another file with a lot of imports, and the segfault appears again. If I leave that last file where the segfault was just introduced, and I remove all the others, there's no issue, so it doesn't appear to be connected to particular files.\n\nI've searched for solutions to this issue for a while but I've picked up on few patterns between the failures and none of the other Sass segfault solutions out there have worked. I've tried:\n- `rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`\n- Downgrading `grunt-sass` to previous versions (which track previous versions of `node-sass`)\n- Downgrading `node` to previous versions\n- Disabling

`fs`: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/227ad25/deps/uv/src/unix/fsevents.c\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the bug?\r\nI'm running the TypeScript compiler in watch mode against a large proprietary monorepo. TypeScript is configured with `TSC_NONPOLLING_WATCHER`, so it uses FSEvents to watch for source code changes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I haven't reproduced this in a more isolated setting yet without proprietary source code. I'm currently working on that and will update this issue as soon as one is available. I opted to create this issue early so others have a place to comment if they see similar problems.\r\n\r\n### How often does it reproduce? Is there a required condition?\r\nI can consistently reproduce this in `tsc` with the aforementioned proprietary repo:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nTSC_NONPOLLING_WATCHER=true node --max-old-space-size=6144 node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --build --watch --preserveWatchOutput --pretty --verbose --extendedDiagnostics\r\n```\r\nAfter TypeScript sets up FSEvent watchers, making a change to any source code file (with `touch`) triggers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[3:33:50 AM] Building project 'tsconfig.json'...\r\n\r\n[3:34:12 AM] Updating unchanged output timestamps of project 'tsconfig.json'...\r\n\r\n[1]    47110 bus error  node --max-old-space-size=6144  --build --watch\r\n```\r\n\r\nI apologize for the non-actionable repro for now. Although this is primarily observable through TypeScript, I do believe this is a Node.js bug. See *Additional information* below. \r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\nNode.js does not crash.\r\n\r\n### What do you see instead?\r\nHere's a crash report summary from `Console.app`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nProcess:               node [42748]\r\nPath:                  /usr/local/Cellar/node/15.11.0/bin/node\r\nIdentifier:            node\r\nVersion:               0\r\nCode Type:             X86-64 (Native)\r\nParent Process:        ???

(Edit: This was actually a more simple stack bounds check. See comments below.) I noticed that this is similar to an issue previously seen on Node.js 0.10.18 and OS X 10.9.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/6251\r\n\r\nThe fix from back then was to simply increase the stack size.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/964\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n   if (attr != NULL)\r\n-    if (pthread_attr_setstacksize(attr, 3 * PTHREAD_STACK_MIN))\r\n+    if (pthread_attr_setstacksize(attr, 4 * PTHREAD_STACK_MIN))\r\n       abort();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe limit hasn't changed since:\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/4947ce51243b32c6b80b8716deab7a33bae92eca/deps/uv/src/unix/fsevents.c#L652-L654\r\n\r\nI recompiled Node.js with `5 * PTHREAD_STACK_MIN` and still saw crashes. `8 * PTHREAD_STACK_MIN` eliminated the problem though. Removing the `pthread_attr_setstacksize` call entirely (so the default macOS `pthread` stack size is used) also fix the issue.\r\n\r\nI'm hesitant to suggest either of those changes as a real fix since this appears to be dependent on how many `fs.watch` calls are made.\r\n\r\n## Other related issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/3168 looks similar, but was due to an issue with the `fsevents` npm module. This issue is happening in Node.js core. (Specifically `fs`.)\r\n\r\nI found https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/669 interesting as well, which changed `libuv` worker threads on macOS to use `RLIMIT_STACK`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues/37697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues/37697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"franz","id":90404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz","html_url":"https://github.com/franz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-31T15:11:58Z","updated_at":"2024-07-31T15:11:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pocl/pocl/issues/1525","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pocl/pocl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pocl/pocl/issues/1525/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pocl/pocl/issues/1525/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pocl/pocl/issues/1525/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pocl/pocl/issues/1525","id":2433091987,"node_id":"I_kwDOALuTh86RBgmT","number":1525,"title":"Kernel execution fails with SIGBUS (Misaligned address error)","user":{"login":"fjarri","id":30720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri","html_url":"https://github.com/fjarri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjarri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2024-07-26T23:15:45Z","updated_at":"2024-12-20T08:25:40Z","closed_at":"2024-12-19T14:29:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":12292999,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjI5Mjk5OQ==","name":"pocl","full_name":"pocl/pocl","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pocl","id":5285403,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjUyODU0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5285403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl","html_url":"https://github.com/pocl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pocl/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pocl/pocl","description":"pocl -
