I was confused because the test says it is mangled for JSON execution, and that does not seem safe for using with either a posix nor cmd shell. I am attempting some local testing, and it looks like if you slow things down in a debugger, it will randomly either fail because it gets EOF (the write was queued then failed later) or EAGAIN (the write failed to be queued) back from this uv_write, either of which is a somewhat sketchy errno mapping (for the write, not a read):\r\n```    case ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE:                 return UV_EOF;```\r\nSeems like the write fix here is to ensure libuv will map both of those errors different for uv_write to mean EPIPE\r\n\r\nDiscovered some test code online that discusses this:
