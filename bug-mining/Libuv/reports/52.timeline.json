   Solution:   Add 'gettimeofday.c' as external dependency to 'protocol_lws_status' project\n                Add \"#include <gettimeofday.h>\" at start of 'protocol_lws_status.c' file    \n\n\n*

I have all the libs I needed, but some testing executables are still crashing when trying to use them.\n\nI hope it could help.\n\nRegards\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/warmcat/libwebsockets/issues/526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/warmcat/libwebsockets/issues/526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/218959218","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/871#issuecomment-218959218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/871","id":218959218,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODk1OTIxOA==","user":{"login":"txdv","id":116642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv","html_url":"https://github.com/txdv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T06:04:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T06:05:09Z","body":"7z can extract the libuv.dll contained in the installer, other than that there is no official way.\n\nAlso, why does libuv even have an installer?

For my part lws is increasingly using libuv both for epoll and for simple cross-platform support.\n\nI'd be happy if I could provide a patch, but I don't have or want windows to try it out.\n\nAlthough supporting unattended install would be best, txdv has a good point.  It should be enough to use 7z to get the dll out and then host the dll myself and fetch it from there.  There should be a way to get Appveyor to cp it somewhere workable.
