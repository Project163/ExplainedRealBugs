This is incorrect, as this leaves the first `addrinfo_ptr` with no `ai_next`. This causes the first pointer to not have an ai_next, which to upstream consumers looks as through there is only a single address returned.","closed_by":{"login":"vtjnash","id":330950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDk1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/330950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash","html_url":"https://github.com/vtjnash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/4577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/4577/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
