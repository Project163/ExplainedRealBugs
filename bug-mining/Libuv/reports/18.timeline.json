addresses issue #205, by naming the anonymous structs and unions in `uv-win.h` to conform to the C89 spec and updating all the affected code. I tried to give meaningful and consistent names to the different private field groups, e.g.:\n\n``` c\nunion {\n  struct { uv_stream_connection_fields };\n  struct { uv_stream_server_fields };\n};\n```\n\nbecomes:\n\n``` c\nunion {\n  struct { uv_stream_connection_fields } conn;\n  struct { uv_stream_server_fields } serv;\n} stream;\n```\n\nWith similar naming for pipe, tcp, tty, fs and the overlapped I/O fields. Since it's a direct replacement it's a bit verbose, and it hits quite a lot of files since the private fields are used basically everywhere, I think it's nice that the fields are now all properly segmented and qualified since it indicates where they belong, though.\n\nHowever I came across one issue and would like some comments: in `uv-common.c`, some functions assume the existence of an `nbufs` member directly inside the `uv_fs_t` struct, which is defined in `UV_FS_PRIVATE_FIELDS`. To me this doesn't seem compatible with the struct/union design currently being used in `uv-win.h` without anonymous structs/unions - should there be some internal functions to bridge the gap between the private field `nbufs` and its usage in the common libuv implementation?\n\n---\n\nWhat do you guys think, is this going in the right direction? Also, I'm intending to rebase and tidy up the comments and make a better git commit message, just looking for some feedback before I proceed since this is quite a large and intrusive commit for the windows implementation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/77429372","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/205#issuecomment-77429372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/205","id":77429372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NDI5Mzcy","user":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-05T19:07:53Z","updated_at":"2015-03-05T19:07:53Z","body":"#239 landed, closing.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/77429372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":247007199,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ3MDA3MTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/events/247007199","actor":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-05T19:07:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
