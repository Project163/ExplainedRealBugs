It's my intend to keep the source as small as possible and reuse most of nodes own code.\n\nTo wrap input and output functions I discovered an interesting behavior of libuv: If I was using node tty.ReadStream or tty.WriteStream node seemed to ignore the fd (which was a PTYs master fd) and all output was printed to stdout instead.\n\nReading libuv's source I discovered the reason for this behavoir:\n\nThe tty.*Stream classes call `uv_tty_init` which checks the type of a the fd. For a pty this type is UV_TTY. Unfortunately libuv assumes, that an fd of the type UV_TTY is always its own tty and therefore reopens /dev/tty. [See this comment for the explaination](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/src/unix/tty.c#L54-L63)\n\nThis behavior may be true for most usages but when feeding a PTYs master fd into this function results in opening the wrong tty.\n","closed_by":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
