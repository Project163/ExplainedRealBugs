We are being pushed in to MSVC2013 territory for Node.js because of the upstream adoption of C++11 by V8 but this is obviously not the case for libuv, so how much depth is needed there and are the MinGW builds still important (initially proposed in #1).\n\nAre there any concerns here held by the libuv team? / @indutny @saghul @bnoordhuis @piscisaureus (I'm guessing here at who constitutes libuv-core btw).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/build/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/build/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/64771468","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/10#issuecomment-64771468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/10","id":64771468,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzcxNDY4","user":{"login":"txdv","id":116642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv","html_url":"https://github.com/txdv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-27T10:22:15Z","updated_at":"2014-11-27T10:22:15Z","body":"check if file /proc/net/if_inet6 exists\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/64771468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"txdv","id":116642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv","html_url":"https://github.com/txdv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/txdv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/64777099","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/10#issuecomment-64777099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/10","id":64777099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Nzc3MDk5","user":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-27T11:10:53Z","updated_at":"2014-11-27T11:10:53Z","body":"> check if file /proc/net/if_inet6 exists\n\nThat's not cross platform.
