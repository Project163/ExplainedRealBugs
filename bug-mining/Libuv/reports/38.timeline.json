I'd  work with the fs API (uv_fs_t, INIT, PATH,  POST, etc.) as I believe they would be useful for implementing the ACL functions.  I'd first implement the acl_get_\\* and acl_set_\\* functions before attempting the rest of them as I believe they would be the most useful.\n\n**Use-cases:**\n\nThese functions would be useful for anyone wanting to use thread safe ACL functions.  I haven't been able to find any implementations yet.  \n\n**Comments:**\n\nI'm open to any comments/suggestions as I am new to libuv and have just been messing around with the code for the past few
