If so, I suggest replacing the text \"within a short period of time\" with \"for the given async handle\", making it clearer that the strongest guarantee made is that the callback will be executed once, ever.\n\nIf uv_async_send actually makes stronger guarantees, then please document them precisely. For example, a useful stronger guarantee would be that the callback is executed consistent with a model where uv_async_send atomically sets a \"needs execution\" flag, and the event loop atomically resets this flag before running the callback. That would rule out the sequence of execution above.\n","closed_by":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
