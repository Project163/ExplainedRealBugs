There's then a double close in `process_cleanup`. I imagine this normally isn't noticeable, but if you're running in the VS2017 debugger then it causes the process to stop in the debugger with a warning popup.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the best solution for this is, but what I've done in my copy is make `process_copy_output` first duplicate the handle using [`DuplicateHandle`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/ms724251(v=vs.85).aspx). (See the code below. I also added a couple of fclose calls that looked to be missing.)\r\n\r\nThe tests then run to completion under the debugger without throwing up any obvious errors.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n--Tom\r\n\r\n```\r\nint process_copy_output(process_info_t* p, FILE* stream) {\r\n  char buf[1024];\r\n  int fd, r;\r\n  FILE* f;\r\n  HANDLE dup;\r\n\r\n  if (!DuplicateHandle(GetCurrentProcess(), p->stdio_out, GetCurrentProcess(), &dup, 0, FALSE, DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS))\r\n    return -1;\r\n\r\n  fd = _open_osfhandle((intptr_t)dup, _O_RDONLY | _O_TEXT);\r\n  if (fd == -1) {\r\n    CloseHandle(dup);\r\n    return -1;\r\n  }\r\n  f = _fdopen(fd, \"rt\");\r\n  if (f == NULL) {\r\n    _close(fd);\r\n    return -1;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  r = fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);\r\n  if (r < 0) {\r\n    fclose(f);\r\n    return -1;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  while (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), f) != NULL)\r\n    print_lines(buf, strlen(buf), stream);\r\n  \r\n  if (ferror(f)) {\r\n    fclose(f);\r\n    return -1;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  fclose(f);\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"tom-seddon","id":1269020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjkwMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1269020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon","html_url":"https://github.com/tom-seddon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-seddon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/1426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/1426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
