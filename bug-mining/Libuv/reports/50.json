This can lead to confusion and two possible interpretations:\n1. It's the filename exactly as stored in the filesystem. True on Linux and OS X, false on Windows.\n2. It's UTF-8. True on Windows, partially true on OS X, true under normal circumstances on Linux (but could be false if a file is intentionally created with a non-UTF-8 name).\n\nSince the purpose of libuv is to allow writing portable cross-platform code, it should discourage writing non-portable code, which is what the first interpretation could lead to. Therefore, I propose that libuv document the following:\n- The filesystem is assumed to be UTF-8 on Linux and OS X and UTF-16 on Windows.\n- Filenames passed and received are encoded in UTF-8, unless the above precondition is violated, in which case the encoding is not guaranteed.\n\nSee nodejs/node#5616 for an example of applying the first interpretation and potentially adding more ways of writing non-portable code to Node.js core.\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
