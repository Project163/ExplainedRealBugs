The reasons for not having a uv_fork() are two-fold, I think:\n1. It's not possible to implement faithfully on Windows.  Cygwin has fork() but take a look at its implementation; it's not a general purpose solution.\n2. Libraries should not normally call fork() unless they execve() immediately afterwards, because most applications are not fork-safe.  Hiding a fork() call in a library somewhere would be a source of bugs, resource leaks, etc.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/64980850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bnoordhuis","id":275871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis","html_url":"https://github.com/bnoordhuis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/65033332","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/20#issuecomment-65033332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/20","id":65033332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDMzMzMy","user":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-01T08:31:43Z","updated_at":"2014-12-01T08:31:43Z","body":"What @bnoordhuis said.

If I open `pts` in parent process, child process(`pppd` in my case) will FAIL with EBUSY (since `pts` still open in parent process), even if I close `pts` after spawning immediatelly. (difinitely racy)\n2. If I force `pppd` to open pts, parent will fail with EIO when creating readable stream connected with `ptmx` since `pts` is still not opened. So, I should get known when `pppd` opens `pts`.

Sometimes Node will run for days without this error, but other times I will get it back to back in a short period of time.  I have seen comments to the effect that it is there to catch programming errors or unexpected conditions and that it one case it was someone's misuse of an API, but I can not find where anyone has elaborated on what the issue actually was or what types of errors cause it. Any help with tracking this down and determining if it is an error in my code or in another component would be greatly appreciated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2247348285,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNDczNDgyODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/events/2247348285","actor":{"login":"vtjnash","id":330950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDk1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/330950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash","html_url":"https://github.com/vtjnash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtjnash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3315dd275430663c092887e836390c2c9742f7f2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaLang/libuv/commits/3315dd275430663c092887e836390c2c9742f7f2","created_at":"2019-04-02T17:38:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2544229046,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1NDQyMjkwNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/events/2544229046","actor":{"login":"Crunkle","id":1208758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle","html_url":"https://github.com/Crunkle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crunkle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d233757b63e6e5f411173deb7427e1b45fca27f6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Crunkle/libuv/commits/d233757b63e6e5f411173deb7427e1b45fca27f6","created_at":"2019-08-08T18:07:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
