And I would like to run uv_queue_work multiple times without having to sleep the main thread. Any idea of how to do this?\n\nSo far I've done this:\n\n```\nvoid main(const FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args) {\n//here goes my main code\n\n//Here I schedule the worker, to run BEFOREmethod in a new thread, and AFTERmethod in the main thread\nuv_queue_work(uv_default_loop(), req, BEFOREmethod,(uv_after_work_cb) AFTERmethod);\n\nreturn callback;\n}\n\n\n\nvoid BEFOREmethod(uv_work_t* req){\n\n//here goes the code that runs in new thread\nusleep(200000);\n}\n\n\n\n\nvoid AFTERmethod(uv_work_t* req, int status){\n\n//here goes the code that runs in main thread\n\n//Then we schedule the uv_queue_work again\nuv_queue_work(uv_default_loop(), req, BEFOREmethod,(uv_after_work_cb) AFTERmethod);\n}\n```\n\nSo this works, I can re-schedule the uv_queue_work, but there is a memory leak, if I keep this running, memory usage keeps increasing. But I haven't found another way of doing this. So I would appreciate any help if anybody has an idea.\n\nThank you in advance!\n","closed_by":{"login":"bnoordhuis","id":275871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis","html_url":"https://github.com/bnoordhuis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnoordhuis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/588/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
