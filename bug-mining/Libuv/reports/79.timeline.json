just got out of `uvw` (that is a `cmake` based project) the stuff used to import `libuv`.\r\n[This](https://github.com/skypjack/libuv_cmake) is the repository where I put a self contained example.\r\nIt shouldn't be difficult to maintain, it's not invasive and... well, it just works.\r\nI'm not sure this is the best way to do that, but I found it pretty easy to use and with a few pros I like definitely.\r\nFor the topic is _Add CMake support_, I'd say it matches the requirements and it's worth mentioning it.\r\nThe good part is that it doesn't _replicate_ somehow the build system of `libuv` and files are not listed explicitly. It downloads and compiles `libuv` as an external dependency and updates it whenever the user runs `cmake`. This should reduce the time spent to maintain the two projects aligned. Unless headers are moved around, build chain is changed or you decide to wipe out the `.libs` directory, it won't require any change to work.\r\nYeah, I'm lazy, but can you blame me?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/315738667/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"skypjack","id":1812216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTIyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1812216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack","html_url":"https://github.com/skypjack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skypjack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/332350391","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/1362#issuecomment-332350391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/1362","id":332350391,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjM1MDM5MQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-26T22:07:14Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T22:07:14Z","body":"Thank you @roxlu for bringing this up!
