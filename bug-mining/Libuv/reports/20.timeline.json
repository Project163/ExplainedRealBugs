io.js dist, node.exe is provided as a separate executable which is confusing and causes problems if your script is relying on `process.execPath` and your intention is to run `iojs` via `node` alias (npm task etc.). \n\nFor Linux, io.js provides a (4bytes) symlink called `node` which points to iojs in `bin/` dir. On Windows we can also create a symlink, and resolve to real executable ([like this](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/blob/6dc6c632cd47f3929a196674b488b8164f9a4793/lib/extensions.js#L12)) but since Windows symbolic links are not sharable FS objects, and they actually reflect the real path if you try to move, copy or package it to a zip. Meaning you cannot copy/paste Windows symlink itself (like shortcut (`.lnk`) files), it will copy the original file instead.\n\nHaving said that, here is a proposed solution:\n\nInspired by [nvmw](https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw/), which downloads only iojs.exe and then makes a copy of `alias-node.cmd` to `node.cmd` in iojs version installation directory like this: [nvmw.bat#L170](https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw/blob/31c2429d3e74f3c5c3cfa260b2c6b97fed200779/nvmw.bat#L170), where [alias-node.cmd](https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw/blob/31c2429d3e74f3c5c3cfa260b2c6b97fed200779/alias-node.cmd) has the canned content:\n\n``` cmd\n:: Created by nvmw, please don't edit manually. \n@IF EXIST \"%~dp0\\iojs.exe\" ( \n   \"%~dp0\\iojs.exe\" %* \n) ELSE ( \n   iojs %* \n) \n```\n\nPlease add this `node.cmd` in io.js distro in place of `node.exe`.\n\nRelated:

is a draft of a possible fix to #206. It uses `GetModuleFileNameW` as before to get some kind of path to the executable, and then gets a handle to the file and resolves the full path (without any symlinks) using `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW`. It's not finished, of course, I have a few questions. With this commit the function will read through symbolic links and return resolved paths like:\n\n```\n\\\\?\\C:\\libuv\\Debug\\run-tests.exe\n```\n\nWhich are completely valid (and fully resolved) Windows paths, but the `VOLUME_NAME_DOS` flag used means that the file actually needs to be on a mounted drive with an assigned drive letter or the function will fail with `ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND`, [as MSDN states](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364962.aspx). The file could be on a mounted drive with no drive letter assigned, and in this case I assume it could be addressed via its GUID (via `VOLUME_NAME_GUID`) as a long UNC path. But is this realistic?\n\nBasically should the function return \"usual\" paths like `C:\\path\\to\\executable.exe` or should it return full-blown UNC paths (which, by the way, apparently can be slightly longer than 32768 characters)? Or whichever is shorter? Does anyone have an opinion on this?\n\nI mean, logically the function should never fail (besides out of resource errors) since the executable always exists somewhere, but this could be a faulty assumption?\n\nEDIT: actually I noticed that the exepath test expects the passed buffer to be filled and truncated if it is too short, so since `uv_exepath` is a two-step process now it might be necessary to allocate 32KB of memory upfront to reliably get the initial path and then have the `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` function handle the truncation for us, assuming it does (since the expanded full path may be longer than the symlink). I'll need to look into that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/164552413","html_url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/206#issuecomment-164552413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/206","id":164552413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDU1MjQxMw==","user":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-14T20:39:23Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T20:39:23Z","body":"Closing in favor of the PR in #293.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/comments/164552413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":491452867,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDkxNDUyODY3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libuv/libuv/issues/events/491452867","actor":{"login":"saghul","id":317464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul","html_url":"https://github.com/saghul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saghul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-14T20:39:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
