\nNope, it's actually `black`. The tricky part is that by default the `@import` directive implies [`once`](http://lesscss.org/features/#import-options-once) option, so the last occurrence of `variables.less` (set in `indirect-b.less`) is not expanded hence the latest definition is `@color: black;` (because the last imported file is `override.less`).\n\nIt will become `red` if you explicitly specify [`multiple`](http://lesscss.org/features/#import-options-multiple) flag for either `indirect-b.less` or for `variables.less` inside it, e.g.:\n\n```\n@import \"indirect-a.less\";\n@import (multiple) \"indirect-b.less\";\n\nbody {\n  color:

N/A\r\n\r\nUser/password (if required and possible - do not post any confidential information here):  N/A\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem: \r\n1.  Run build of an OpenUI5 library project by calling grunt build\r\n2.  Rename the target directory target.one\r\n3.  Run the build again\r\n4.  Compare the target and target.one directories\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected result?  Contents of the directories from the two different builds are the same.\r\n\r\nWhat happens instead?  Contents can be vastly different.\r\n\r\nAny other information? (attach screenshot if possible)\r\nIn our case, the project being built has a reasonably complex .less inheritance/import chain.  There could be up to 5 levels of inheritance to a single theme.  For example, the inheritance chain for one of our themes (from the less files with least precedence to most) is:\r\nbase > sap_belize > sas_base > sas_corporate\r\n\r\nIt seems like less files are getting loaded or processed in different orders between builds.  We don’t know if this has to do with the asynchronous file loading introduced between 0.2.0 and 0.5.2.  In our debugging, we put log messages in lib/fileUtils – before line 64, which is the fs.readFile(fileInfo.path, { line and before line 70, which is the resolve({ line and saw the following for base.less:\r\n\r\nDebug statements when incorrect CSS generated:\r\nReading file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\sap_belize\\base.less \r\nResolving file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\sap_belize\\base.less \r\nReading file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\base\\base.less \r\nReading file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\sap_belize\\base.less \r\nReading file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\base\\base.less \r\nResolving file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\base\\base.less \r\nResolving file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\sap_belize\\base.less \r\nResolving file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\base\\base.less\r\n\r\nDebug statements when correct CSS generated:\r\nReading file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\sap_belize\\base.less \r\nResolving file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\sap_belize\\base.less \r\nReading file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\base\\base.less \r\nReading file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\base\\base.less \r\nReading file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\sap_belize\\base.less \r\nResolving file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\base\\base.less \r\nResolving file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\base\\base.less \r\nResolving file: C:\\dev\\master\\htmlcommons-themes\\openui-framework-themes\\build\\tmp\\build\\unpackedOpenuiCompileAndProvidedDependencies\\resources\\sap\\ui\\core\\themes\\sap_belize\\base.less\r\n\r\nWhen sap_belize is “resolved” last, the resulting CSS is as expected.
