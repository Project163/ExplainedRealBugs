Awesome feature, but not the proper tool for this job. One specific limitation of that approach comes when other selectors should be added to a specific instance:\n\n```\n// via mixin\n.my-selector {\n  // can't put additional selectors here\n  .pseudo-states({\n    // rules\n  }, //maybe here as a catch-all arg? feels wrong.);\n\n// via variable\n.my-selector {\n  .my-other-selector,\n  .and-another,\n  @{pseudo-states} {\n    // rules\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2499/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
