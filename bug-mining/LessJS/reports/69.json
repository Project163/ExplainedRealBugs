We have a single file (above) that imports each breakpoint, to make modifying the overall site breakpoints easier. Because we don't want to create one-off breakpoint files and manually import them into the main file, we put the definitions inside one of the existing breakpoint partials (i.e. `Large\\_header.less`) wherever the breakpoint would occur (in the test case, 900px breakpoint is in-between 1200px (large) and 800px (small)).\n## Comments\n\nThis is frustrating for many reasons, as I'm sure you can see (documentation). I use CSSDOC syntax so I use block comments all over.\n\nSingle line comments (`//`) are not affected since they are ignored in the output.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
