Sure, there are plenty of languages\nout there where properties and methods can't share the same name or\ngetters/setters can't have different accessibility levels. But, this just\nfeels wrong. I didn't even realize I could do .wrap when only .wrap() is\ndefined until I ran into a stack overflow error and resorted to your\ndocumentation. I've always used .wrap() to mixin something I wanted to hide\nfrom the CSS output.\n\n—\nReply to this email directly or view it on\nGitHubhttps://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/issues/413#issuecomment-9742516.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/9744503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/9744654","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/413#issuecomment-9744654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/413","id":9744654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3NDQ2NTQ=","user":{"login":"OlsonDev","id":308072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODA3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/308072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev","html_url":"https://github.com/OlsonDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlsonDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-24T15:50:11Z","updated_at":"2012-10-24T15:50:11Z","body":"@matthewdl, I would expect an error in the example provided in the documentation. `.wrap` as a class (to be output & usable as a mixin) was never defined; `.wrap()` was.
