work with @Tomdye and we managed to track it down to two files importing the same dependency.\n\nUnfortunately the exact content of our less files are commercially sensitive so we can't just cut and paste wholesale but they are structured something along the lines of:\n\nmain.less:\n\n```\n@import \"/path/to/dependencyOne\";\n@import \"dependencyTwo\";\n```\n\ndependencyOne.less:\n\n```\n@import \"../../dependencyTwo\";\n```\n\nThis happened (for us at least) seemingly randomly in 1.7.0 (and tried 1.7.3) - sometimes the first pass, sometimes it took up to 80 compiles in a row to get the error mentioned here. But it ALWAYS happened eventually.\n\nWe removed the import for dependencyTwo in main.less and the issue went away (we ran the compile 1500 times in a while loop and it was fine). The second we reverted this change the issue came back again.\n\nHope this helps @lukeapage and others fix this - happy to answer questions on config/setup if it helps but as I say we can't share the code unfortunately.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/48593817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rhiadj","id":1793567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTM1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1793567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj","html_url":"https://github.com/rhiadj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhiadj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":140135381,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQwMTM1Mzgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/140135381","actor":{"login":"tomdye","id":814453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDQ1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/814453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye","html_url":"https://github.com/tomdye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-10T11:39:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":140135382,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MDEzNTM4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/140135382","actor":{"login":"tomdye","id":814453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDQ1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/814453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye","html_url":"https://github.com/tomdye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomdye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-10T11:39:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":140135383,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQwMTM1Mzgz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/140135383","actor":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-10T11:39:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":140135384,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MDEzNTM4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/140135384","actor":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","av
