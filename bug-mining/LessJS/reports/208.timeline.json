believe Travis's connection to the phantomjs mirror is getting throttled.\nI've copied a workaround that uses Travis caching to avoid 99% of the downloads.\nAnd also changed the download location back to the original bit bucket.\n\nYou can see it in https://github.com/less/less.js/pull/2941\n\nThe appveyor build still fails on node.js 0.10 and 0.12.\nThis is due to a separate issue with a race condition between the downloading of the dependencies from npm and the execution of the **install script** for phantomjs-prebuilt.\nI managed to bypass it on Travis using a **retry** hack.\nHowever, in appveyor the retry command does not seem to work...\n\nI don't know how to solve the appveyor problem.\nperhaps it is time to consider removing appveyor testing on node.js 0.10 and 0.12.\nAs those node versions only have two or four months respectability in the node.js Long Term support plan anyhow...\n\nSome claim this problem appears and disappears randomly. Which make sense as it is a race condition... perhaps it will suddenly start working :) \n\nThe root problem is still unresolved here.\nThat is the dependency on external binaries which do not have sufficiently good hosting.\n\nPerhaps the real solution would be to get rid of phantomjs usage all together.\nBut this will require a much greater change. \nBecause the plugin used for testing **grunt-contrib-jasmine** has absolutely no concept of **separation of concerns** unlike something like [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma)\nwhich allows usages of different browsers (including phantomjs) different testing libraries (mocha/jasmine/qunit) and different test reporters.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/235745116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bd82","id":4233843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzM4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4233843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82","html_url":"https://github.com/bd82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/235997582","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2898#issuecomment-235997582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2898","id":235997582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTk5NzU4Mg==","user":{"login":"bd82","id":4233843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzM4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4233843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82","html_url":"https://github.com/bd82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T19:20:31Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T19:20:31Z","body":"I've
