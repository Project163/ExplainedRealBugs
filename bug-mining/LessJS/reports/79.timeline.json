I have been using the alpha version less-1.4.0-alpha.js on the client-side only (no command line yet - not that it should be any different really).\n\nSo far, everything works as I would expect except for two major drawbacks which can be explained with one example. Take the following code which is located in one of my root LESS files:\n\n```\n.container { margin: 0 auto; }\n .container.positioned { position: absolute }\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 30em) {\n    .container.positioned { left: 50%; }\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 48em) {\n    .container { width: 30em; }\n    .container.positioned { margin-left: -15em; }\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 60em) {\n    .container { width: 48em; }\n    .container.positioned { margin-left: -24em; }\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 60em) {\n     .container { width: 60em; }\n     .container.positioned { margin-left: -30em; }\n}\n```\n\nIssue 1 - styles defined within media queries do not get extended. Anything trying to extend the .container class only gets the margin: 0 auto styles.\n\n```\n.some-element:extend(.container);\n```\n\nIssue 2 - compound selectors do not get extended. However, the first participant DOES get extended. For example, the following incorrectly extends the .container styles but not the intended .container.positioned styles.\n\n```\n.some-element:extend(.container.positioned);\n```\n\nI wish I could provide a solution. Hope this helps.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/13226934","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1165#issuecomment-13226934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1165","id":13226934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjI2OTM0","user":{"login":"Soviut","id":226882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjg4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/226882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut","html_url":"https://github.com/Soviut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soviut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-07T08:54:31Z","updated_at":"2013-02-07T08:54:31Z","body":"Well what would CSS proper do?

I have since put a lot more time in thought into the `:extend` feature and do not really stand by this comment any more.  I would like to leave it here for the purpose of conversation, but this should not be a guideline or a suggestion.\n\n---\n\nI have just run into scenario number 2, and I would like to voice my opinion about it.  Let me provide some example code:\n\n```\n.shared-style { width: 10px; height: 10px; } \n\n@media screen and (min-width: 30em) {\n    .shared-style { padding: 5px; } \n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 30em) {\n    .shared-style { margin: 8px; }\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .some-element:extend(.shared-style) { }\n    .some-other-element:extend(.shared-style) { }\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 60em) {\n    .shared-style { background-color: red; }\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 60em) {\n    .shared-style { background-color: green; } \n}\n```\n\nAfter spending much time thinking about this, I don't know that there is really one single elegant solution.  The most elegant solution (in my opinion) is for the compiler to copy styles from other media queries and build a brand new style declaration so that the above might end up as:\n\n```\n.shared-style { width: 10px; height: 10px; } \n\n@media screen and (min-width: 30em) {\n    .shared-style { padding: 5px; } \n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 30em) {\n    .shared-style { margin: 8px; }\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .some-element,\n    .some-other-element { \n        width: 10px;\n        height: 10px;\n        padding: 5px;\n        background-color: green;\n    }\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 60em) {\n    .shared-style { background-color: red; }\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 60em) {\n    .shared-style { background-color: green; } \n}\n```\n\nThe only way this works is for the compiler to be smart enough to know which styles to copy and which styles not to copy.  The most realistic solution is to disallow the use of `:extend` within a media query in favor of using classic mixins.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/13274676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DesignByOnyx","id":514040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDA0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/514040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx","html_url":"https://github.com/DesignByOnyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DesignByOnyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/13854431","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1165#issuecomment-13854431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1165","id":13854431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODU0NDMx","user":{"login":"dmi3y","id":1277279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzcyNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1277279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y","html_url":"https://github.com/dmi3y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmi3y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-20T20:26:44Z","updated_at":"2013-02-20T20:28:58Z","body":"Definitely I like:\n\n> c) match everything inside its own media query plus everything not inside another media query, but it should bring that extend inside itself..\n\n I could miss something right now but it sounds logical.

I agree that `extend` within a media query should:\n1. Match everything within its own media query - which is a very \"normal\" thing to expect and should be considered _implied_ moving forward IMO (for the sake of typing).\n2. Match everything **outside** of media queries, but should **copy** those styles into itself\n\nEven though I agree, the interesting thing about number 2 is we are no longer \"extending\" but rather duplicating styles in the fashion of a plain ol' mixin.  This is very important IMO because the whole idea of `:extend` was to minimize duplication.  But for the time being, let's assume that this is how `extend` should work within media queries.\n\nBy the same token of grabbing everything \"outside\" of media queries, should we not grab everything in other currently matching media queries?  Best shown by example:\n\n``` css\n.b { }  <-- These get copied\n\n@media only screen and (min-width: 30em) {\n    .b { }  // <-- Why shouldn't this get copied?  It applies to anything greater than 30em\n}\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .a:extend( .b ) { }\n}\n@media only screen and (max-width: 60em) {\n    .b { }  <-- This hurts my head

one you kind of have to wring your brain through. Think of :extend in general usage as a replacement for referencing mixins (so, copying the entire contents of the mixin within your selector). \n\nSo, I guess what I'm saying is that I would kind of expect us to do whatever has the same effect as referencing the mixin. Media queries create isolated sets, so I think extends should get walled off. As in:\n\n```\n.b { }\n\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .a:extend( .b ) { }\n}\n\n// output\n.b {\n}\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .a {  // EDITED: contains properties of .b, effectively same as using a class as mixin\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYes, @DesignByOnyx, it would be a copy, but it's not necessarily the SAME copy because of the different ways you can extend (could contain base properties only).\n\nIllustrated more clearly:\n\n```\n.b {\n}\n.c {\n}\n.d {\n}\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .a:extend( .b, .c ) { }\n}\n@media only screen and (max-width: 60em) {\n    .a:extend( .c, .d ) { }\n}\n```\n\nHopefully, I've made obvious in the above example that the root classes should not be modified. The \"result\" of .a is local to that media query.\n\n**UPDATE:**\nIf it's copying (not modifying the original block) it doesn't really need to include the original.... so the output of the above would end up being:\n\n```\n.b {\n  color: blue;\n}\n.c {\n  border-width: 1px;\n}\n.d {\n  background: none;\n}\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .a{ \n       color: blue;\n       border-width: 1px;\n     }  \n}\n@media only screen and (max-width: 60em) {\n    .a{ \n       border-width: 1px;\n       background: none;\n     }

- I totally agree with you and @Soviut with `extend` not \"escaping\" the scope of the media query.  However, there is this issue of copying from outside the media query.\n\nWith the example you provided, I would expect a different result.  Let me add a property to show you:\n\n``` css\n.b { padding: 5px }\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .a:extend( .b ) { }\n}\n/*\n.b { padding: 5px }\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .a { padding: 5px }\n}\n*/\n```\n\nThat's what I meant by copying.  I ran into this issue in the real world where I wanted an element to inherit my grid styles ONLY beginning at `min-width: 48em`.  Here is some real world code I tried to use with alpha `extend`:\n\n``` css\n.grid-wrap {\n    letter-spacing: -0.31em !important;\n    word-spacing: -0.43em !important;\n\n    > * {\n        letter-spacing: normal;\n        word-spacing: normal;\n        display: inline-block;\n        vertical-align: top;\n        .box-sizing(border-box);\n    }\n}\n\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .artist-list:extend( .grid-wrap ) {\n        > li { width: 33.3% }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI personally would expect the .grid-wrap styles to be copied into the media query, the same as writing the following (which is what I ended up with in my real world code):\n\n``` css\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .artist-list {\n        .grid-wrap;\n        > li { width: 33.3% }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDoes anybody else think this is the way `:extend` should work?  We would get the benefits of using the modifiers (deep, shallow, etc) so that I would really write it like this today:\n\n``` css\n@media only screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n    .artist-list:extend(
