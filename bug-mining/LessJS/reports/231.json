Too many exceptions in the future?\r\n\r\n@seven-phases-max :\r\nWell, there're a lot of other possibilities, e.g. `./` or require parens for division (e.g. `1/2`->`1/2` but `(1/2)`->`0.5`) etc... \r\nAlso, the \"special cases\" (e.g. properties where `x/y` can appear as shorthand) are not so rare (starting at `padding`/`margin` and ending with `background`/`border-radius` and eventually there can be [more](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/#animation-shorthand-property)) so we just can't hardcode them all like it's done for `font` (and because of that I think that the current font \"workaround\" is just a temporary and quite dirty kludge that ideally should be removed too). \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1880/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
