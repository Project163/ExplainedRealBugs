My Less plugin to resolve Bower imports is nearly complete. Besides the one issue with auto-appended Less extensions (https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2235) I have one more Bower-specific edge case:\n\nMany Less developers use import files like [these](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/less/bootstrap.less). Bower however allows you to place these references into the `bower.json`. It could look like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"main\": [\n    \"variables.less\",\n    \"mixins.less\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nMy `resolve` function returns an array of filenames in this case and I would like to know how I should handle `loadFile` than? I see two possibilities:\n\n**1) Merge files**\n\nI could basically call the `loadFile` function multiple times and return the merged result. It could look something like that:\n\n```\nBowerFileManager.prototype.loadFile = function(filename, currentDirectory, options, environment) {\n        var that = this;\n        return this.resolve(filename, currentDirectory).then(function(filenames) {\n            // this.resolve is a promise which returns an array of filenames\n            // most of the time it just contains one filename, but sometimes a bower.json\n            // references multiple less files\n\n            // we can create multiple loadFile-promises and wait for all of them with Q.all\n            return Q.all(filenames.map(function(filename) {\n                return FileManager.prototype.loadFile.call(that, filename, '', options, environment);\n            })).then(function(files) {\n                // reduce returned loaded files to one file\n                return files.reduce(function(previousValue, currentValue, index, array) {\n                    // concatenating contents is no problem...\n                    previousValue.contents += '\\n' + currentValue.contents;\n                    // TODO: How to handle previousValue.filename?\n                    return previousValue;\n                });\n            });\n        });\n    };\n```\n\nI can concatenate the `contents` easily, but how should I handle `filename`? When is `filename` used - I guess in the source maps?\n\n**2) Create virtual file**\n\nWhen I detect a `bower.json` I could just dynamically create a virtual less file and set its filepath to the `bower.json`.\n\n```\n{\n  \"main\": [\n    \"variables.less\",\n    \"mixins.less\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nbecomes\n\n```\n{\n  contents: '@import \"variables.less\"\\n@import \"mixins.less\";',\n  filename: 'some-module/bower.json'\n}\n```\n\nI think this would work quite well, but maybe this is an unnecessary bloated step...? \n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":181472658,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTgxNDcyNjU4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/181472658","actor":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"148a0f59082d531c3297169a143d89bb13642d7d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/commits/148a0f59082d531c3297169a143d89bb13642d7d","created_at":"2014-10-21T12:16:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/59918454","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2235#issuecomment-59918454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2235","id":59918454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTE4NDU0","user":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-21T12:18:23Z","updated_at":"2014-10-21T12:18:23Z","body":"Okay, this is fixed, override tryAppendLessExtension and return the first parameter unchanged and .less will never get appended.\nCan you test against HEAD or would you like a beta 2 release?
