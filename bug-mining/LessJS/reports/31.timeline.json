I've stepped through the code and all references to `this.filename` are stripped of the path, so when the error is raised, it can't retrieve the correct index in parser.imports.contents.\n\nI think the discrepancy is here:\n\nLine 230 of less.js: `that.contents[path] = contents;`\nLine 3235 of less.js: `var filename = href.match(/([^\\/]+)$/)[1];`\n\nThe latter line strips all filename references of any path information, and so the link between the filename and parser.imports.contents[] is subsequently broken. Since the filename reference is used throughout, not sure what the fix would be without passing in the \"root\" path directory.\n\nThis also implies that filename conflicts might arise if two files in separate directories with the same filename are both imported.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/723/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
