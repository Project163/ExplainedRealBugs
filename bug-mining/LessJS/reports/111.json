to the LESS language reference, the !important keyword \"marks all properties brought by the mixin as !important\".\n\nHowever, if some of those properties are brought in by nested / sub mixins, the !important keyword is not added to those properties.\n\nI've tested this on both 1.3.3 and 1.4.0 beta, and the output is identical... so it's not something that has been addressed in the new beta version.\n\nGiven this input:\n\n``` css\n.mixinBorder() {\n    border: 1px solid red;\n}\n\n.mixinText() {\n    color: gold;\n}\n\n.mixinBorderAndText() {\n    .mixinBorder();\n    .mixinText();\n}\n\ndiv.blueNoBorder {\n    color: blue;\n}\n\ndiv.blueNoBorder.withGoldAndRed {\n    .mixinBorderAndText() !important;\n}\n```\n\nand running lessc from the command line with \"lessc input.less\", I get the following output:\n\n``` css\ndiv.blueNoBorder {\n  color: blue;\n}\ndiv.blueNoBorder.withGoldAndRed {\n  border: 1px solid red;\n  color: gold;\n}\n```\n\nI'd expect the !important keyword to be passed down to nested mixins to provide this:\n\n``` css\ndiv.blueNoBorder {\n  color: blue;\n}\ndiv.blueNoBorder.withGoldAndRed {\n  border: 1px solid red !important;\n  color: gold !important;\n}\n```\n\nIt makes no difference whether I remove the brackets in the mixin calls or not.\n\nAm I reading too much into the wording of the language reference and expecting too much, or is this a bug?\n\nThanks!\n\nDan\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
