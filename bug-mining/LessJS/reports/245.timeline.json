releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.1.0</h2>\n<h1>Mixin parentheses requirement removed</h1>\n<p>This was maybe too big a change without some kind of deprecation or conversion.\nSo for this version, this works again:</p>\n<pre><code>.mixin;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>This release has 2 breaking changes:</p>\n<h3>Parentheses required for mixin calls</h3>\n<p>This aligns it with syntax for calling detached rulesets.</p>\n<p>Example</p>\n<pre lang=\"less\"><code>.mixin() {}\n.mixin;  // error in 4.0\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Parens-division now the default math setting</h3>\n<p>Parentheses are required (by default) around division-like expressions, to force math evaluation.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"less\"><code>@ratio_large: 16;\n@ratio_small: 9;\n<p>/** The following will produce <code>device-aspect-ratio: 1.77777778</code> by default in 3.x */\n<a href=\"https://github.com/media\"><code>@​media</code></a> all and (device-aspect-ratio: <a href=\"https://github.com/ratio\"><code>@​ratio</code></a>_large / <a href=\"https://github.com/ratio\"><code>@​ratio</code></a>_small) {\n.body { max-width: 800px; }\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>Produces:</p>\n<pre lang=\"css\"><code>@media all and (device-aspect-ratio: 16 / 9) {\n  .body {\n    max-width: 800px;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can, of course, get old math behavior.
