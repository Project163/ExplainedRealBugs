I was previously using `less@1.7.4`, but have recently upgraded to `less@2.1.2`.\n\nI have a mixins.less file in a nested directory with:\n\n```\n.plan-gradient(@color){\n  background: svg-gradient(to bottom,\n    fade(@color, 0%) 0%,\n    fade(@color, 5%) 60%,\n    fade(@color, 10%) 70%,\n    fade(@color, 15%) 73%,\n    fade(@color, 20%) 75%,\n    fade(@color, 25%) 80%,\n    fade(@color, 30%) 85%,\n    fade(@color, 35%) 88%,\n    fade(@color, 40%) 90%,\n    fade(@color, 45%) 95%,\n    fade(@color, 50%) 100%\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe problem I have is that the folder in which the mixin resides is getting appended to within the url, like so:\n\n```\nbackground: url(oe-bootstrap/'data:image/svg+xml,base64,PD9.....');\n```\n\nI believe the offending code is in [`lib/less/tree/url.js` Lines 26-31](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/v2.1.2/lib/less/tree/url.js#L26-L31) since that if gaurd is not checking is the url is a data-url. I will follow up with a pull request unless there is a larger issue I am not seeing.\n\nI originally reported this issue as webpack/less-loader#30.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
