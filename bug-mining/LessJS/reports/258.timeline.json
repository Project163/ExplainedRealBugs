Fixes #3698 and Fixes  #3373.\r\n\r\n**Why**:\r\n\r\nThis helps to avoid crashes when importing pre-minified css files from e.g. an npm package. In our case, [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) always drops the trailing semicolon on the last property. This cannot be disabled without disabling all of whitespace normalization (`normalizeWhitespace` option). Fixing the bug in Less.js fixes this use case for us.\r\n\r\n**How**:\r\n\r\nWhen calling `permissiveValue` on a detected css variable, the `untilTokens` parameter is left unset. This defaults it to detecting `;` for ending the value. I've set the parameter to `/[;}]/` instead in order to close variables on either the semicolon (`;`) or the closing curly bracket (`}`) character. This may not be the most optimal fix, but it gets the job done in the test cases I've added. Additionally, it doesn't break any of the existing test cases.\r\n\r\n**Checklist**:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Documentation N/A\r\n- [x] Added/updated unit tests\r\n- [x] Code
