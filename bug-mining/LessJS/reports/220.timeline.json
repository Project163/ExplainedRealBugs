fixes multiple bugs (#6549 #5762 #6214 ) and implements #3793 by upgrading from Gulp `3.9.1` to `4.0.0` which was released a few months ago.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this is to incorporate a series of vulnerability fixes (`minimatch`, `hoek`, and `lodash`) that were introduced within the dependencies of `gulp`, and as a result were patched starting in Gulp v4.\r\n\r\nThe basic upgrade flow works like this:\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade Gulp from `3.9.1` to `4.0.0`\r\n2. Upgrade `gulp-help` to the version that specifically supports Gulp4 (`1.6.1` to `chmontgomery/gulp-help#gulp4`)\r\n3. Upgrade additional dependencies that fix additional audit issues (`gulp-concat-css`, `gulp-copy`, `gulp-less`, `gulp-watch`, and `github`)\r\n4. Remove `run-sequence` which is now deprecated and natively replaced with [`gulp.series`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/4.0/docs/API.md#gulpseriestasks)\r\n5. Fix `calc()` errors that arose out of interpolated strings with the latest version of `gulp-less`\r\n\r\nWith those tasks complete, `npm install` works and completes as intended with no errors and 0 security vulnerabilities.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6566/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":8,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6566/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
