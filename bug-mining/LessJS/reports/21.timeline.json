I'm pretty sure this is because what I want to do is outside of the current scope of LESS. \n\nHeres my proposed mixin:\n// Fontface\n\n.font-face (@fontname, @fontfile) {\n    @font-face {\n        font-family: @fontname;\n        src: url('../fonts/' + @fontfile '-webfont.eot');\n        src: url('../fonts/' + @fontfile '-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\n

@fontname) format('svg');\n        font-weight: normal;\n        font-style: normal;\n    }\n}\n\nIf there is an existing way of achieving this awesome, i'd love to learn, but if not i think this
