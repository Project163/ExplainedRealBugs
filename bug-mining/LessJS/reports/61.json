Grab this Gist: https://gist.github.com/2898117\n2. Place in a folder whose name contains ()s -- e.g. \"test(2)\"\n3. Place LESS .js file in the same folder\n4. Open index.html\n\n**Expected:**\nBoth divs have a green border.  One style comes from the LESS file, the other comes from the CSS file which is imported by the LESS file.\n\n**Actual result:**\nOnly the first div has a green border.  The imported CSS file is never loaded, so only the styles in the LESS file are applied.\n\nThe problem is apparent if you look at the generated CSS output:\n\n``` css\n@import url(file:///C:/code/test(2)/included.css);\n```\n\nThe relative -> absolute URL conversion added text containing the parens, which are not allowed unless they're escaped or the whole URL is wrapped in quotes.  From http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#uri:\n\n> Some characters appearing in an unquoted URI, such as parentheses, white space characters, single quotes (') and double quotes (\"), must be escaped with a backslash so that the resulting URI value is a URI token: '(', ')'.\"\n\n**Workaround:**\nIn the original LESS source, wrap the relative URL in quotes: `@import url(\"included.css\");`.  This will cause the generated CSS code to also use quotes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/831/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
