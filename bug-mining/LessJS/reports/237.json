Using certain characters in the namespace make the mixin undefined. I am working in node.js on less 3.9.0 latest. I was attempting to use the word \"#Effects()\" as my namespace name. \r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe this has something to do with using characters that are used in hex colors? If you using characters out of the hex range (A-F) the error goes away. I have found that names that include \"D\", \"E\" and \"F\" are giving the error. Any combination over two letters gives the error.\r\n\r\nTo test, I grabbed the documentation example on namespaces (below):\r\n\r\n```less\r\n#Library() {\r\n  .colors() {\r\n    primary: green;\r\n    secondary: blue;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#Library() {\r\n  .colors() { primary: grey; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button {\r\n  color: #Library.colors[primary];\r\n  border-color: #Library.colors[secondary];\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then tried different names for the namespace, the following all result in the mixin being undefined:\r\n\r\n- #Effects\r\n- #Effect\r\n- #Def\r\n- #DEF\r\n- #DEFFER\r\n- #ABC\r\n- #ABBF\r\n\r\nExample test:\r\n\r\n```less\r\n#DEF() {\r\n  .colors() {\r\n    primary: green;\r\n    secondary: blue;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#DEF() {\r\n  .colors() { primary: grey; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button {\r\n  color: #DEF.colors[primary];\r\n  border-color: #DEF.colors[secondary];\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
