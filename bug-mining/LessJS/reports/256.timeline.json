#3991, I changed the syntax of our colors to a modern rgba syntax.\r\nFor example, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85) would become rgba(255 255 255 /\r\n85%). However, less v3 seems not to understand that properly, and\r\nperforms division on the last two parts, resulting in output of\r\nrgba(255 255 3%), which is indeed invalid.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue by upgrading to less v4, which understands the\r\nnew rgba syntax and leaves it alone. The output for that will now\r\nmatch the input.\r\n\r\nTo work around an issue with less v4, this uses a prerelease version\r\nwith a fix for https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/3693 .
