W3C recommendadtion about universal selectors: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-namespace/ Section: 4. CSS Qualified Names:\n\n> Example V:\n> \n> Given the namespace declarations:\n> \n> @namespace toto \"http://toto.example.org\";\n> @namespace \"http://example.com/foo\";\n> \n> In a context where the default namespace applies\n> \n> toto|A\n>     represents the name A in the http://toto.example.org namespace. \n> |B\n>     represents the name B that belongs to no namespace. \n> *|C\n>     represents the name C in any namespace, including no namespace. \n> D\n>     represents the name D in the http://example.com/foo namespace. \n> \n> The syntax for the portion of a CSS qualified name before the local name is given below, both for qualified names\n> that allow wildcard prefixes (wqname) and for qualified names that disallow wildcard prefixes (qname). (The syntax > uses notation from the Grammar appendix of CSS 2.1. [CSS21] Note this means that comments, but not white \n> space, are implicitly allowed between tokens.):\n> \n> qname_prefix\n>   : [namespace_prefix]? '|'\n>   ;\n> wqname_prefix\n>   : namespace_prefix? '|'\n>   | '*' '|'\n>   ;\n\nThe code that is responsible for these extra whitespaces in less.js is:\n\n``` javascript\ntree.Combinator.prototype.toCSS = function (env) {\n        return {\n            '' : '',\n            ' ' : ' ',\n            ':' : ' :',\n            '+' : env.compress ?
