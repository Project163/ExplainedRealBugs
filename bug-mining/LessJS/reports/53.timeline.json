I get this show in Firebug though, at line 3696: `arguments is not defined`, even though I know the mixin is good (as it worked when imported through the main file, and not via an import statement. The line that is marked as failing is this:\n\n}(arguments));\n\nAny ideas please?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/9583956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alibby251","id":802739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjczOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/802739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251","html_url":"https://github.com/alibby251","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibby251/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/9766375","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/982#issuecomment-9766375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/982","id":9766375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3NjYzNzU=","user":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-25T05:17:41Z","updated_at":"2012-10-25T05:17:41Z","body":"please
