Trying to work around it made Issue #1508 obvious, even though it is present here too with the extraneous selectors in the resulting merged query.\n\nAnother example:\n\n``` css\n/* desktop size */\n.rule-a-1,\n.rule-b-1 {\n    width: 10px;\n    height: 10px;\n    @media screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n        background-size: 20px 20px;\n    }\n}\n\n/* mobile size */\n.rule-a-2,\n.rule-b-2 {\n    width: 5px;\n    height: 5px;\n    @media screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n        background-size: 10px 10px;\n    }\n}\n\n/* combined rule-a */\n.rule-a {\n    .rule-a-1;\n    @media screen and (max-width: 320px) {\n        .rule-a-2;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe expected output is\n\n``` css\n/* desktop size */\n.rule-a-1,\n.rule-b-1 {\n  width: 10px;\n  height: 10px;\n}\n@media screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n  .rule-a-1,\n  .rule-b-1 {\n    background-size: 20px 20px;\n  }\n}\n/* mobile size */\n.rule-a-2,\n.rule-b-2 {\n  width: 5px;\n  height: 5px;\n}\n@media screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n  .rule-a-2,\n  .rule-b-2 {\n    background-size: 10px 10px;\n  }\n}\n/* combined rule-a */\n.rule-a {\n  width: 10px;\n  height: 10px;\n}\n@media screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n  .rule-a {\n    background-size: 20px 20px;\n  }\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 320px) {\n  .rule-a {\n    width: 5px;\n    height: 5px;\n  }\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 320px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n  .rule-a {\n    background-size: 10px 10px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nbut instead the final media query is\n\n``` css\n@media screen and (max-width: 320px) and screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n  .rule-a .rule-a-2,\n  .rule-a .rule-b-2 {\n    background-size: 10px 10px;\n  }\n```\n\nWhen I first bumped into this I notice the extraneous rules, but not the invalid media query. When I tried to work around this using AT import \"someFile\" screen and (max-width: 320px) the invalid media query remained.
