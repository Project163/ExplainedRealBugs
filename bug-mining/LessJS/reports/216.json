Namely, this example:\n\n```\n@inputs: input[type=text], input[type=email], input[type=password], textarea;\n\n@{inputs} {\n  &:focus {/*properties*/}\n} \n```\n\nDid not produce what was expected, as it failed to recognize the commas as separators of individual selectors. So instead of this **expected output**:\n\n```\ninput[type=text]:focus,\ninput[type=email]:focus,\ninput[type=password]:focus,\ntextarea:focus {\n  /*properties*/\n}\n```\n\nIt produced this **unexpected output** of just adding the `:focus` on the end of the whole variable value:\n\n```\ninput[type=text], input[type=email], input[type=password], textarea:focus {\n  /*properties*/\n}\n```\n\nIf the variable interpretation for selectors uses the same algorithm as when a variable is in a string, I can see \"why\" it is doing it that way, but it would seem to me that, at least for the case of the `,` in CSS, the variable interpretation needs to recognize it is dealing with a selector at that point, and should then take the next step and parse each of the commas to separate selectors, so that all nested uses of `&` will attach to all the appropriate selector strings.\n","closed_by":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1421/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
