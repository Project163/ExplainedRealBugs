This does not happen is the .selector:extend() syntax is used.\n\nYou can see an example of this, using 1.5.0 b4, here: http://jsfiddle.net/phobia/YARj7/\n\nThe same does however happen in e.g. v. 1.4.1.\n\nSample LESS:\n\n```\n/**\n* The following example, \"a\", produces duplicate classes\n*/\n.a_bar {}\n\n.a_foo {\n  &:extend(.a_bar);\n  margin-bottom: 1em;\n}\n\n.a_a {&:extend(.a_foo);}\n.a_b {&:extend(.a_foo);}\n.a_c {&:extend(.a_foo);}\n\n\n/**\n* The following example, \"b\", does not produce duplicate classes\n*/\n.b_bar {}\n\n.b_foo:extend(.b_bar) {\n  margin-bottom: 1em;\n}\n\n.b_a:extend(.b_foo) {}\n.b_b:extend(.b_foo) {}\n.b_c:extend(.b_foo) {}\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\n/**\n* The following example, \"a\", produces duplicate classes\n*/\n.a_foo,\n.a_a,\n.a_b,\n.a_c,\n.a_a,\n.a_b,\n.a_c {\n  margin-bottom: 1em;\n}\n\n/**\n* The following example, \"b\", does not produce duplicate classes\n*/\n.b_foo,\n.b_a,\n.b_b,\n.b_c {\n  margin-bottom: 1em;\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1591/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
