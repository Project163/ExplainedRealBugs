The easy way - modify the regex used to classify  urls as relative/absolute, excluding any string that starts with '@{'\nI pulled it off locally -   https://gist.github.com/1047106.  Still, that's just a temporary fix until I can find out how to do it \n1.  The right way - use the regex in its current state to test the interpolated value of all urls.  I'm not familiar enough with the code base, so I don't know the proper way to eval the string...  if anyone could point me in the right direction, I'd be happy to fork and resolve this

Yes, though that's only reproducible using the rel=less method.

don't want to join development or put out a patch, but I do have an explanation and a fix (version 1.3.0).\n\nPermanent fix (Non-Minified Source) Line 3013 (function tree.URL):\n\nif (typeof(window) !== 'undefined' && !/^(?:https?:\\/\\/|file:\\/\\/|data:|\\/|@)/.test(val.value) && paths.length > 0) {\n\nExplanation:\n\n@base-url: \"http://assets.fnord.com\";\n.thing{ background-image: url(\"@{base-url}/images/bg.png\"); }\n\nDuring parsing, url(\"@{base-url}/images/bg.png\") matches as a url and currently gets compared to the regular expression: /^(?:https?:\\/\\/|file:\\/\\/|data:|\\/)/\n\n\"@{base-url}/...\" doesn't match (since the variable hasn't been interpolated yet).\n\nSo its considered a relative path. So it gets turned into: url(\"http://localhost:3000/path/to/stylesheets/@{base-url}/images/bg.png\").\n\nThen variable interpolation takes place, turning it into: url(\"http://localhost:3000/path/to/stylesheets/http://assets.fnord.com/images/bg.png\");\n\nThe fix is to include @ as an initial dis-qualifier of relative paths (as I've done in my fix above). I think it will still be interpolated and then re-ran through the tree.URL transform. If the interpolated value is relative, I think it will then be prefixed with the absolute url; if it is absolute, it will be left alone.\n\nI hope someone else takes this minor fix and puts the energy in to merge it into the code base.
