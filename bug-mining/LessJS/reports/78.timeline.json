I used this feature quite a bit in Sass, and I got here because I can't quite figure out how to port my stylesheets.\n\n@evadne explains a good use case for default parameters. https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/issues/43#issuecomment-283831\n\n@agatronic the implementation you mention does seem heavy-handed, but it has the added benefit of supporting functions as default values. I've been using those a lot in Sass. I define mixins that cover entire widgets (e.g. a text field), default all the colors (font, borders, shadows in all states) based on one color, and allow keyword arguments to override the auto-generated colors.\n\nIn case it helps, here is the test case I wrote before I started looking at the source code, and realizing this is hard.\n\n``` less\n.simple(@color: #ff0000) {\n  background-color: @color;\n}\n.red-button {\n  .simple();\n}\n\n.chained(@background: #ff0000, @border: @background) {\n  background-color: @background;\n  border-color: @border;\n}\n.redder-button

.function();\n}\n```\n\nAnd this is the expected result.\n\n``` css\n.red-button {\n  background-color: #ff0000;\n}\n.redder-button {\n  background-color: #ff0000;\n  border-color:
