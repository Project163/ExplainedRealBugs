Thanks for implementing that (assuming the support was intentional, rather than just a fluke.)  There's a bug with variable substitution though, with repeated calls to the same mixin:\n\n``` less\n.vertical-gradient(@color) {\n    background-color: @color; // the base color\n    filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=@color, endColorstr=@color);\n}\n\n.rule1 {\n    .vertical-gradient(#fff);\n}\n\n.rule2 {\n    .vertical-gradient(#000);\n}\n```\n\nThe generated CSS for .rule2 is:\n\n``` css\n.rule2 {\n  background-color: #000000;\n  filter: progid:dximagetransform.microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#ffffff, endColorstr=#ffffff);\n}\n```\n\nNote that background-color gets the correct parameter value of #00000, but the filter clause gets the #ffffff parameter value from the previous call to the mixin.\n\nBTW, you should update the website to explain the %() printf type method, and the e() method, and change the example of the ~\"...\", since it implies that it's needed for filters which is no longer the case.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
