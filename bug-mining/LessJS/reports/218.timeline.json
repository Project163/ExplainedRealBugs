((Though I do understand it was an unintentional \"feature\"))\n\n``` less\n@list: apple, satsuma, banana, pear;\n\n.loop(@index) when (@index <= length(@list)) {\n    @item: extract(@list, @index);\n    .fruit-@{item} {\n        content: \"Just a test.\";\n    }\n    .loop(@index + 1);\n}\n.loop(1);\n```\n\nI think we should add some nice clean declarative syntaxes to handle the common cases where you'd think you want a for loop. ie: Something declarative like the `@when` idea was, rather than the if/else ideas which weren't.\n\nI haven't thought of the best syntax for this yet, and I'd like other ideas too.\n\nThe first and simplest possible syntax would be to auto-expand lists inside of selectors:\n\n``` less\n@list: apple, satsuma, banana, pear;\n\n.fruit-@{list} {\n  content: \"Just a test.\";\n}\n```\n\nHowever this isn't that great because there's no obvious way to use the current value inside of the selector (ie: It would be an ugly hack to support `content: \"Just a test @{item}\";` or `content: \"Just a test @{fruit}\";`) and it's rather non-obvious that this selector expands to four different rules instead of one.\n\nAnother idea might be a syntax like this:\n\n``` less\n@list: apple, satsuma, banana, pear;\n\n@expand @fruit in @list {\n  .fruit-@{fruit} {\n    content: \"Just a test @{fruit}\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis one is rather straightforward, it properly supports an item variable, while also becoming flexible enough to do more than just `.fruit-@{fruit}`. Though it needs a bit of bike-shedding over whether to call it `@expand` or something like `@for`, `@foreach`, or `@each`, whether it should be `@fruit in @list` or `@list as @fruit`.\n\nOr maybe given the current style of when() maybe a syntax like this:\n\n``` less\n@list: apple, satsuma, banana, pear;\n\n& each (@list as @fruit) {\n  .fruit-@{fruit} {\n    content: \"Just a test @{fruit}\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou could also make it a little more like `when (...)` by putting it directly on the `.fruit-*` selector though that might read a little backwards (since the variable in the selector is declared in the each that comes 'after'.\n\n``` less\n@list: apple, satsuma, banana, pear;\n\n.fruit-@{fruit} each (@list as @fruit) {\n  content: \"Just a test @{fruit}\";\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1694/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-20T10:46:25Z","updated_at":"2014-01-20T10:46:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1817","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1817/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1817/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1817/events","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1817","id":25909816,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNTkwOTgxNg==","number":1817,"title":"Using

border... depending of it parent. \n\nI can't simply use a class .background-color for all my elements to colorize for example, for several reasons.\n\nI wanted to create one variable with all the selectors to colorize, for example : \n\n```\n@background-color : ~'selector1, selector2:hover, selector3 ...';\n@text-color : ~'selector4, selector2:hover, selector10 ...';\n@border-color : ~'selector4, selector2:hover, selector10 ...'\n```\n\nAnd after that, using my page parent class name :\n\n```\n.master-1 {\n    @{background-color} { background-color:@color1;}\n}\n\n.master-2 {\n    @{background-color} { background-color:@color2;}\n}\n```\n\nBut the issue is that the output should be : \n\n```\n.master-1 selector1, .master-1 selector2:hover, .master-1 selector3 {\n    background-color:black;\n}\n```\n\nAnd in fact, it's : \n\n```\n.master-1 selector1, selector2:hover, selector3 {\n    background-color:black;\n}\n```\n## To summarize : \n\n```\n.master-page-1 {\n    .selector-1, .selector-2 {\n        background-color:@color1;\n    }\n}\n\n.master-page-2 {\n    .selector-1, .selector-2 {\n        background-color:@color2;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd\n\n```\n@my-selector: ~'.selector-1, .selector-2';\n.master-page-1 {\n    @{my-selector} {\n        background-color:@color1;\n    }\n}\n\n.master-page-2 {\n    @{my-selector} {\n        background-color:@color2;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nShould output the same CSS, but only the first is correct : \n\n```\n.master-page-1 .selector-1, .master-page-1 .selector-2 {\n    background-color:black;\n}\n.master-page-2 .selector-1, .master-page-2 .selector-2{\n    background-color:black;\n}\n```\n\nThe second output : \n\n```\n.master-page-1 .selector-1, .selector-2 {\n    background-color:grey;\n}\n\n.master-page-2 .selector-1, .selector-2 {\n    background-color:grey;\n}\n```\n\nDo you have any idea about this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1817/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/38629997","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1421#issuecomment-38629997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1421","id":38629997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjI5OTk3","user":{"login":"pavlovich","id":1209167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDkxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1209167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlovich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-25T22:35:19Z","updated_at":"2014-03-25T22:35:19Z","body":"I

Consider this:\n\n```\n@inputs: {input[type=text], input[type=email], input[type=password], textarea {.getProps()}};\n@pseudo: ~':focus';\n@props: { /*properties */};\n\n.setProps(@selectors; @props; @extension: ~'') {\n  @selectors();\n  .getProps() {\n     &@{extension} { @props(); }\n  }\n} \n\n.setProps(@inputs; @props; @pseudo);\n```\n\nWhich outputs:\n\n```\ninput[type=text]:focus,\ninput[type=email]:focus,\ninput[type=password]:focus,\ntextarea:focus {\n  /*properties */\n}\n```\n\nSo I can assign a pseudo class if I want or not, and pass a set of properties as needed. The key is to put the mixin `.getProps()` call into the block that is defining the selectors for variable `@inputs`, which is then called as a local mixin inside `.setProps()` so that the properties get put where we want them. The `@extension` could be any escaped string to add to each selector as an additional part of the selector string. Above I do `:focus` as a pseudo class, but I could have done `~' > div + div'` as a child and sibling combination, or whatever.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/38701009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"scottgit","id":2047892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2047892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit","html_url":"https://github.com/scottgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":105694679,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTA1Njk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/105694679","actor":{"login":"pavlovich","id":1209167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDkxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1209167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlovich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-03-26T15:52:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":105694680,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwNTY5NDY4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/105694680","actor":{"login":"pavlovich","id":1209167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDkxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1209167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlovich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlovich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-03-26T15:52:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-11T09:25:11Z","updated_at":"2014-04-11T09:25:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1967","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1967/labe

Many prominent libraries for LESS (bootstrap, hat, etc.), have emerged, each with dozens of configuration variables which could very well overlap and conflict with each other.\n\nCurrently, namespaces support private variables, the only way to get at them is via mixins within the namespace and those mixins can then be used externally; Sort of like a closure:\n\n```\n#ns {\n    @size: 10px;\n    .box() {\n        width: @size;\n        height: @size;\n    }\n}\n\n.icon {\n    #ns > .box();\n}\n```\n\nWhich yields:\n\n```\n.icon {\n    width: 10px;\n    height: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, I think it would be very handy to do the following:\n\n```\n#ns {\n    @size: 10px;\n}\n\n.icon {\n    width: #ns > @size;\n    height: #ns > @size;\n}\n```\n\nAs well as update those variables within the namespace:\n\n```\n#ns > @size:

In this case, the variable reference is added as an `Element` in a `Selector` in an array of selectors inside `Ruleset`. This can be re-parsed at eval-time as selectors, but then you have to correctly re-organize the tree so that what was thought to be an element is actually an entire list of selectors, so you need to merge those selectors into the top-level selectors BUT they may NOT be selectors (and may be elements), so they need to be preserved and just evaluated.\r\n\r\n~~If someone wants to take the work on that branch and run with it, be my guest.
