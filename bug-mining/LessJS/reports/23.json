When I add a LESS stylesheet like so:\n\n```\n<link href=\"stylesheet.less\" type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet/less\">\n```\n\nThe resulting `style` tag is:\n\n```\n<style type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" id=\"less:stylesheet\"></style>\n```\n\nThe `media=\"screen\"` part is added by LESS automatically, and should not be there. Under HTML5's specification, if the media attribute is omitted, it is assumed to be \"all\". LESS should either honour this and set `media=\"all\"` on the `style` element, or simply omit it when it's not present on the `link` tag. The latter would be best, I think.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
