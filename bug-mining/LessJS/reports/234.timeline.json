Or are there other ways to solve this problem?\r\nThank you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T11:02:05Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T11:02:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3176","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3176/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3176/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3176/events","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/3176","id":298752490,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTg3NTI0OTA=","number":3176,"title":"Howto disable HSL color convertion to HEX?","user":{"login":"determin1st","id":16524081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTI0MDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16524081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st","html_url":"https://github.com/determin1st","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/determin1st/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-02-20T21:20:02Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T11:02:05Z","closed_at":"2018-02-20T23:24:56Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":527644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjc2NDQ=","name":"less.js","full_name":"less/less.js","private":false,"owner":{"login":"less","id":3538330,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1MzgzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3538330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/less","html_url":"https://github.com/less","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/less/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/less/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/less/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/less/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/less/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/less/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/less/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/less/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/less/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js","description":"Less.

Less isn't a linter, and those aren't Less functions. If the parser tries to get super-clever at CSS functions, it's going to fail.

All necessary facility to handle this with Less is there since its v1.x - see below. The only challenge is to code it in a non-bloating way.\r\n\r\n>I assume we would need to specially flag functions since there's nothing special about function registry \r\n\r\nNo, the functions should just return `undefined` (or `null`) if they find they can't evaluate their args: [like this](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/3.x/lib/less/functions/color.js#L273) (unless they also detect the args are 100% erratic and it's better to trigger a error). .\r\nAnd the undefined return value makes the function evaluator to fallback to the initial string representation: [Demo](http://lesscss.org/less-preview/#%7B%22less%22%3A%22demo%20%7B%5Cn%20%201%3A%20contrast(foo)%3B%5Cn%20%202%3A%20extract(bar%2C%202)%3B%5Cn%20%203%3A%20contrast(var(--whatever))%3B%5Cn%20%20%2F%2F%20etc.%5Cn%7D%22%7D).\r\n\r\n>And a similar check for `var()`\r\n\r\nAlso no, there's no need to check for `var` or anything specific (basically unknown things from a CSS future). That's the point. The code should check for what is possible to evaluate (known things) instead of what is not possible to evaluate (unknowns). \r\n(though the details may very depending on the specific function - that's not so important).\r\n\r\n----\r\nBtw., notice that `--var` is also a built-in Less function (as well as *any* `ident(...)` thing) that is simply not implemented explicitly (hence it simply falls back to self-string-representation) because there's no need for it to be. But a plugin (for example) may override it with its own implementation that may return potentially evaluable value.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/394458985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/394478910","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2986#issuecomment-394478910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2986","id":394478910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDQ3ODkxMA==","user":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-04T19:56:55Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T19:56:55Z","body":"@seven-phases-max Oh okay, so you think the simple fix is for these CSS/Less functions to return undefined rather than throw an error (to render as-is)?
