@seven-phases-max:\n> Anyone to confirm?\n\nConfirmed.\n\nIf an SVG image defines an intrinsic ratio in any way, then Firefox will honor it when the SVG is used as a background image; even when the SVG in question is configured with `preserveAspectRatio=\"none\"`.\n\nThe only way to override that is to set an explicit `background-size : 100%`.\n\n(See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Scaling_of_SVG_backgrounds)\n\nThe jsfiddle in question has a (decoded and pretty-printed) SVG source of:\n\n``` svg\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.1\"\n  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 1 1\" preserveAspectRatio=\"none\"\n>\n  <linearGradient id=\"gradient\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"\n    x1=\"0%\" y1=\"0%\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0%\"\n  >\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#f6f7f8\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#d0d1d5\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" fill=\"url(#gradient)\" />\n</svg>\n```\n\nIts viewbox is setting up an intrinsic ratio, which is not what you'd want. It also contains quite a bit of unnecessary noise that can be stripped out to shrink the SVG down in size.\n\nHere's what that SVG _should_ be:\n\n``` svg\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <linearGradient id=\"g\" x1=\"0%\" y1=\"0%\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0%\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#f6f7f8\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#d0d1d5\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n  <rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"url(#g)\" />\n</svg>\n```\n\nAnd the resulting fiddle:
