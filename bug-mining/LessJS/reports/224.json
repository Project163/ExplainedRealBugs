One out of every 5-6 times I execute the compiler like so:\r\n\r\nlessc --plugin=clean-css=\"level=1\" --plugin=autoprefix=\"ie 11,Edge >= 13,Chrome >= 47,Firefox >= 45,iOS >= 9.2,Safari >= 9\" input.less output.css\r\n\r\nI get this message:\r\n\r\nundefinedError: Error setting options on plugin index.js\r\nunrecognised clean-css option 'ie'\r\n\r\nIt appears that clean-css is trying to read the parameters of autoprefixer. When I reverse the order I get a similar error from autoprefixer. I've tried using --autoprefix and --clean-css directly instead of --plugin to no avail. Is there some kind of trick to preventing the either plugin from being \"greedy\" and reading each other's parameters? Is this a plugin-specific issue?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
