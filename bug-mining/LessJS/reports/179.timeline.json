But appearing after a forward slash doesn't indicate a URL parameter; it just indicates a path.\n\nAn alternative would be to parse the import path using [url.parse](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html#url_url_parse_urlstring_parsequerystring_slashesdenotehost) and to look for `css` in the query string or the hash. Please let me know what solution you'd prefer, and I'll adjust as needed.\n\nRefs https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2364\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19959220157,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAgNHM4DLWlHzwAAAASlqYe9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/19959220157","actor":{"login":"thorstone137","id":343876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Mzg3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137","html_url":"https://github.com/thorstone137","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aaa2462bdbae45862db6e2561b806081cab3cdd7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thorstone137/less.js/commits/aaa2462bdbae45862db6e2561b806081cab3cdd7","created_at":"2025-09-27T14:33:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
