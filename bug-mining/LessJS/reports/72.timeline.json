I think I understand now and know what is \"as designed\" and what is a bug.\n\nI think that if less.js would interpret parentheses as a math only, it would be easier to use and read. Having to be careful about the difference between `(12 (13 + 10 -23))` and `(12 (13 + 10 - 23))` makes mistakes and misreads easy to happen. \n\nThere is one advantage of the current approach - consistency. Top level expressions and in parentheses expressions are evaluated the same way. So I can see the case for expressions in parentheses. However, the empty separator inside the parentheses and a comma should behave the same way. I do not see a relevant difference between them. \n\nI still prefer parentheses as math only, but maybe other people have different opinion.
