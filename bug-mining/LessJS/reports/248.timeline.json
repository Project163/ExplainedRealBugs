So, the long and short is that the difference between those versions is that the codebase was transformed to ES6 syntax. Which isn't technically a breaking change, which is why it wasn't a major version.\r\n\r\nBUT... my suspicion is that some of the Babel conversions for things like object / array spread syntax are less efficient than the more verbose ES5 versions. That's why I was asking if you could test 3.10.0, because originally I was exporting a transpiled package that was compatible with Node 6 and up, but it [broke an integration with a particular library](https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/3414) that couldn't handle class syntax. So I went down to Node 4 with no class constructs.\r\n\r\nIf we can figure out exactly which ES5 transform is not performing well, we could theoretically more granularly set those Babel export settings to a more performant export.

In general, converting an AST like Less's with _n_ depth into a serialized, flatted output tree like CSS involves lots of temporary object creation. So, what could be happening is that with certain transforms, it's adding an additional _x_ amount of objects. Even temporarily, you can get an exponential effect where each node creating even just 2-3x the objects, multiplied by the number of nodes multiplied by the number of times it has to flatten rules... I could see it adding up. We were probably naive in general to essentially think of ES6 syntax as essentially syntactic sugar of ES5 syntax. (JavaScript developers are probably guilty of this in general.) In reality, transpiling newer syntax can create ES5 patterns that are not very performant. For 99% of devs, this isn't a big deal because they're not iterating through that code hundreds or thousands of times per second. But this is my guess as to what's happening, because there were no other major changes.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/532310022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2640636321,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY0MDYzNjMyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/2640636321","actor":{"login":"kevinramharak","id":14903712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAzNzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14903712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinramharak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-17T17:01:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2640636323,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NDA2MzYzMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/2640636323","actor":{"login":"kevinramharak","id":14903712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAzNzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14903712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinramharak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinramharak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-17T17:01:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/532310543","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/3434#issuecomment-532310543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3434","id":532310543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjMxMDU0Mw==","user":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/
