#59, #36, #35.\r\n\r\nThis makes a lot of *very* messy changes to the site and recasts what we have as mostly links to existing documentation and resources in various repos across the `ipfs` org. Resources from the [existing docs site](https://ipfs.io/docs) are copied instead of linked because this site is meant to replace that one (with the notable exception of the examples). Features of this site that were totally broken (e.g. search, submenus in the sidebar) are hidden or overridden just enough to get them functional.\r\n\r\n**The code and visuals here are not meant to be the focus** — in fact, they’re all pretty bad and will need plenty of re-working in the future. This PR is about making sure the site is:\r\n\r\n- Basically workable for users (not full of pages with no text except TODO; no frustratingly broken features like search)\r\n- Covers all the major resources *we already have* in a clear, understandable, navigable way\r\n- Provides sensible spaces for people to contribute new or improved documentation\r\n\r\nI’ve organized things here into four major categories with several subcategories:\r\n\r\nI'm hoping this lends a little more clarity and organization to things where we had a lot of major topic areas before. We still have those same sections, but now they are organized under 4 main sections:\r\n\r\n1. **Introduction** (this is basically just the existing “getting started” guide, plus a link to the FAQ)\r\n2. **Guides**\r\n    - **Concepts** (These are all new. The docs here don’t cover nearly all the concepts we need, but it’s a start. Each is also on the minimal side; they could definitely be fleshed out more. See #56 for more about this.)\r\n    - **Guides** (This is a little redundant. Trying to get the nav working nicely made this the most expedient way to do things, but it probably makes sense to eventually move the links here directly into the top-level “guides” section.)\r\n    - **Examples**\r\n3. **Reference**\r\n    - **Commands & API**\r\n        - **CLI Commands** (Freshly re-generated, with a little extra descriptive info at the top)\r\n        - **HTTP API** (Freshly re-generated, with a little extra descriptive info at the top)\r\n        - **JS & Go Libraries** (This is a link to [`ipfs/interface-ipfs-core`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core), but folks have now told me the Go parts may never be filled in, so I think this needs some re-thinking.)\r\n    - **Go Implementation** (All the written guides that are specific to the Go version. Also includes generated GoDoc package documentation for `coreapi` and `go-ipfs-api`. @lgierth had already written tooling to automatically pull in and generate these. Are these the right ones to start with? What should we add? Should we keep them at all?)\r\n    - **JS Implementation** (A very brief high-level overview of ways to use IPFS in JS, plus links to `js-ipfs` and `js-ipfs-api` repos. This does *not* have package API docs like the Go section does because the JS libraries don’t have much in the way of generatable docs. What they do have is *semi-structured* in the READMEs — if we came up a standard way to structure it, we could include them here, but I eventually gave up on finding a way to do this that worked well and didn’t feel totally janky. This requires a broader effort. cc @diasdavid @alanshaw + other JS folks)\r\n    - **Specifications & Planning** (In addition to specs, the whitepaper, roadmap, and implementation status docs are here. Not sure if there’s a better place for them.)\r\n4. **Community** (To be honest, this section turned into a bit of a grab-bag.)\r\n    - **Applications** (Official/semi-official applications built on top of IPFS. This is a short list; I think we should keep it to things that are really pretty solid efforts and which are at least sort of ready for serious usage. Cluster has already gone ahead and made its own site and documentation, which seems good; I’m not sure this site can do a perfect job of serving all the specific needs around Cluster and around IPFS proper, so this was a good place to link to it. Are there other things I missed that should be linked here?)\r\n    - **Community** (Like guides/guides, this is kinda redundant ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ — should these also be lifted up so each link is a direct child of the top-level community section? **Would love some feedback here.**)\r\n    - **Get Involved** (Includes a *very* lightly edited copy of @VictorBjelkholm’s work in https://github.com/ipfs/website/pull/237, plus links to other docs that felt really important — contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and style guides.)\r\n    - **Related Projects** (Links to Libp2p, IPLD, and Multiformats projects. These are links to the *home pages* for those projects, not the Github orgs. Is that right? Should shipyard be here?)\r\n\r\nIn this version, nearly everything is listed directly in the sidebar. Hopefully this structure allows us to try some nicer things with navigation and layout (e.g. the top level sections could be collapsible, or maybe they could be listed in the top bar, while the sidebar just has the links for the current subsection). This version goes as far as tweaking the style to include some resources from [`ipfs-css`](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-css), but I wanted to do the simplest thing that worked for now and leave better design and layout for a subsequent PR with more feedback :)\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n### The Reference Section\r\n\r\nI think there are a lot of unsolved questions and concerns about various items in the reference section, though I think what’s in this PR might be acceptable *for now* so people can at least *find* all the relevant bits.\r\n\r\n- The CLI and HTTP docs are separated from the Go and JS implementation sections. We only have one unified set of docs for these right now, so I at least think this *sort of* makes sense. Since the HTTP API for Go can be used from JS and vice-versa, I *do* think it makes sense to keep that reference at the top level (though we need to add clear info about what endpoints are supported for each and in what versions). I’m not sure if this is as true for the CLI. While JS and Go are largely aiming for parity here, my understanding is that there will probably always be a few commands that are unique to each.\r\n\r\n- The “JS & Go Libraries” section that links to the [`ipfs/interface-ipfs-core`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core) docs really only covers the JS library. It appears as though it was intended to cover Go, too, but what I’ve uncovered from asking around is that *many* folks aren’t actually working towards that, let alone are even sure it totally makes sense. I’ve kept it in the common “commands & API” section for now because A) that’s all still unclear and B) pretty much every outside developer who’s seen it has found it to be extraordinarily useful compared to the HTTP docs because it includes clear examples of use and output. The HTTP docs only show schemas, which is not *nearly* as helpful for many folks (see also the research docs). However, all of this *really* needs some thinking and resolution:\r\n\r\n    - The interface docs are still not a perfect replacement for the HTTP docs — they don’t discuss how arguments are set over HTTP and they don’t cover some more complicated cases like https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/use-http-to-get-a-file-why-has-extra-data/3039/3\r\n    - If the Go bits are never really going to be documented in the interface docs, we should be clear about that and remove all the references to Go. We should also figure out if this is the best way to *document* that API rather than just test it. (Should we move those docs here? Should we *copy* them here as part of the build the way we generate the Go package docs? Should we reformat them as JSDoc comments and *generate* them here? (That would certainly allow for some fancier formatting.) Should we do something that allows them to feed into package/API docs for `js-ipfs` and `js-ipfs-api` [see above]?)\r\n\r\n- The HTTP docs are generated from the Go implementation, where the documentation is very focused on the CLI (so it doesn’t explain how things work over HTTP when the HTTP version differs drastically, as in the [`/get` discussion linked above](https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/use-http-to-get-a-file-why-has-extra-data/3039/3). This also guarantees that it does a poor job covering differences between the Go implementation and the JS implementation. (Which endpoints where implemented in which versions; which aren’t implemented yet in one or the other implementation; which don’t quite work the same?) **At this point, I’m feeling that the right *future direction* for the HTTP doc is to write and update it manually (rather than generate it), even though that may be a lot of work.**\r\n\r\n- The CLI docs are largely just the same as using `ipfs --help` on the CLI. How much does it make sense to keep them? What about the differences between `go-ipfs` and `js-ipfs` as noted with the HTTP API above? If we keep them, should we move them under the `Go Implementation` subsection?\r\n\r\nI’m happy to make issues here in which to discuss these if folks think they warrant it. **Hopefully we can keep most commentary on this PR to what is relevant to shipping it — i.e. do these docs need to move or change *now*?**\r\n\r\n### The Old Examples\r\n\r\nThe [examples](https://ipfs.io/docs/examples/) from the old docs site are not quite perfectly copied over and the page for them here (http://localhost:1313/guides/examples if you’ve got it running locally) links to the old site. They are copied here in the `content/guides/viewer` directory, but marked as drafts so they don’t get published. I went back and forth on a few questions around these:\r\n\r\n- The idea of an “examples viewer” based on bl.ocks.org is a neat one, but it’s yet another thing to maintain. It doesn’t even fully serve the existing examples (e.g. https://ipfs.io/docs/examples/example-viewer/example#../api/service/readme.md has a *lot* more stuff you can’t see in the viewer). *Should we continue with the viewer idea or just recast these examples as normal pages on the site?*\r\n\r\n- They are all pretty old and some are out-of-date enough to be potentially inaccurate. Should we spend some time auditing them for correctness or would it be better to throw them out?\r\n\r\n### Other Technical Bits\r\n\r\n- I tried to largely keep the build workflow with `make` the same as it is in `ipfs/website` and `ipfs/ipfs-cluster-website`, using Less, autoprefix, and clean-css. However, the latest version of everything doesn’t seem to work together perfectly (e.g. I ran into [this bug in Less](https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/3187)). As we move towards cleaning up the layout and design, maybe we want to switch things up (e.g. use PostCSS, build with Webpack or Parcel)? I’m also not 100% sure Hugo is the best fit ([this nav bar code](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/blob/reorganize-for-minimal-docs-site/themes/material/layouts/partials/nav.html) is horrifying, and while it could be better, it would still be pretty complicated because of Hugo’s lack of plugins). Again, I wanted to keep the the changes minimal and simple for this PR, but there’s definitely plenty to think about here.\r\n\r\n- I pulled in `ipfs-css`, but didn’t really wind up using it directly. Instead, it copies the font files in a `make` step and uses another script to convert `theme.json` into a set of Less variables (since I’m using the colors in ways that aren’t perfectly well supported by the included Tachyons-style CSS rules). I had to make my own copy of the CSS that references the fonts, though, because it’s not separable from the Inter-UI font CSS (which we don’t use here) in the distributed package. I’m happy to post some issues on that module about making that process better supported. /cc @olizilla\r\n\r\n- I’ve hidden the search input because it doesn’t actually work (I didn’t remove it from the code, again, because I realized I didn’t want to go too far in changing the site layout here). Even though it’s really useful, I think we should simply drop search for now. Figuring out how to make it work well when half the content isn’t actually *in* this site is its own crazy pile of work.\r\n\r\n- The existing JS seems to get stuck in a pretty tight loop and can eventually start taxing your CPU, so fixing it up or just throwing it out and entirely redoing the layout (the existing theme requires the JS for proper layout) is pretty important in a subsequent PR. I think the theme we have here isn’t an actual public Hugo theme, but instead a result of @lgierth half-porting [this theme for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material). The assets are all pre-minified, so it’s a bit of a mess to try and actually *fix.*\r\n\r\n- The menu/nav system is a little nutty and flips between an old system of enumerating all the contents of a section and using Hugo’s built-in menu system (originally needed because of the external links, but then I also made [this ugly hack](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/blob/reorganize-for-minimal-docs-site/content/introduction/faq.md)). At any rate, this really needs cleanup:\r\n\r\n    - We can use the old method of enumerating the contents of each section, with hacks like the FAQ’s `external` frontmatter field to get external links. It’s not well supported in Hugo and results in some really complicated code, but it does keep things visible in the directory structure instead of in the [`config.toml` file](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/blob/reorganize-for-minimal-docs-site/config.toml#L21).\r\n\r\n    - We can just wholesale use the Hugo menu system, which is well supported and more clean, if limited in functionality.\r\n\r\n    - We can ditch both those and just encode the menus in the layout.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Per @olizilla, switch to Less v2 because of bugs :(\r\n- [x]
