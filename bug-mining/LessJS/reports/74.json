Here's how I duplicated this issue:\n\n``` bash\n$ cat test.less\nh1 {\n    color: fadeOut(#336699, 30%);\n}\n\n$ lessc -v\nlessc 1.3.0 (LESS Compiler) [JavaScript]\n\n$ lessc test.less\nh1 {\n  color: rgba(51, 102, 153, 0.7);\n}\n\n$ sudo npm install -g less@1.3.3\n...\nless@1.3.3 /opt/local/lib/node_modules/less\n└── ycssmin@1.0.1\n\n$ lessc test.less\nh1 {\n  color: fadeOut(#336699, 30%);\n}\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.
