Chrome works fine. I've tried every version from 2.0 beta 1 on through 2.5, and this problem exists in all of them.\n\nSo, I bisected the tree, and this appears to have been introduced in d31be578a3b35c7b0f43738e26f42576bab48ce9.\n\nThis problem is more than just annoying. It's actually caused some very bad interactions with some JavaScript on the page, which expected CSS to be loaded properly at the time of execution. Unfortunately, that means we're stuck on 1.7.5 for the time-being (not a huge deal, though we are hitting some bugs with it that have been fixed since..).\n\nI spent some time investigating this change, the referenced bug numbers, and the pull request introducing it. The intent, it seems, was to add a function (`less.registerStylesheets`) that other callers can call that can return a `Promise` and then allow the caller to call `less.refresh` or whatever it wants. That seems like a great addition, but it's unclear whether it was intended to change the initial load behavior.\n\nI've changed this locally (just to test) to move the bulk of `less.registerStylesheets` out into a `less.registerStylesheetsImmediately`, and to have `less.registerStylesheets` wrap that in a `Promise`. Then, the initial page load calls `less.registerStylesheetsImmediately`, followed by `less.refresh`, without using promises. This returns to the original loading behavior from 1.7.5 in Firefox. I'm happy to supply a pull request for that, if the general idea sounds good.\n\nUnfortunately, that didn't solve the issue entirely for Safari (though it definitely improved it). More bisecting led me to commit 544bd3abf084f7ab5586d7b578d3e37494cebc31. It's 4:15AM though, and I'm falling asleep, so that's as far as I'm getting tonight.\n\nHopefully that helps someone in diagnosing the cause. Would love to see this fixed :)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/96612444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chipx86","id":4063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86","html_url":"https://github.com/chipx86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/96817050","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2317#issuecomment-96817050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2317","id":96817050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2ODE3MDUw","user":{"login":"chipx86","id":4063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86","html_url":"https://github.com/chipx86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-27T20:55:28Z","updated_at":"2015-04-27T20:55:28Z","body":"Following up on this.\n\nThe Safari-specific issue I mentioned was noticed when I had tested my fix on top of commit d31be57.

This resulted in visual issues while\nloading on some browsers (noticed in Firefox and Safari), along with\nbreakages of any custom JavaScript that depended on the computed style\nof elements on the page, due to race conditions.\n\nThis change preserves the promise for initial page loading, in order to\nretain support for `less.pageLoadFinished`, but immediately executes the\nstylesheet scan (through a new `less.registerStylesheetsImmediately`\nfunction) and the `less.refresh()` call. That resulting behavior matches\nversions of less prior to 2.0.\n\nThis unveiled a regression in registering functions, both in the browser\nand in unit tests, that was not previously noticed due to the\nasynchronous load. Registered functions would have a `less` variable set\nto the less options, and not less itself, when not going through the\nasynchronous loading mode. This meant that both unit tests and\nreal-world function registration would break when the sync page loading\nwas fixed. Overriding `window.less` to point to the actual less module and\nnot `less.options` during bootstrap fixes this.\n\nThis fixes #2317.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2575/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/96949421","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2317#issuecomment-96949421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2317","id":96949421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2OTQ5NDIx","user":{"login":"chipx86","id":4063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86","html_url":"https://github.com/chipx86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-28T06:52:51Z","updated_at":"2015-04-28T06:52:51Z","body":"Just a note on the change I have up for review: There's a bug it uncovered in GitHub's diff viewer, causing a line to disappear from the change.
