It should be removed and the Nashorn PR at #2985 should be refactored. \r\n\r\nMy proposal is that Nashorn support is a separate repo with `less` as a dependency (as mentioned on that thread), such that the \"Less Java\" repo is at `https://github.com/less/less-java`. BUT this is contingent on a dedicated Java developer taking on this work of both\r\n  a) migrating that PR \r\n  b) being the core maintainer of `less-java`\r\n\r\nEither way, no one seems to be active in maintaining Rhino, so it needs to be removed.","closed_by":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3241/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3241/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
