a bit confused because comments were deleted\nso, I may be wrong, but here is my understanding\n1st - less imports are always relative, they do not observe relativeUrls\n2nd - import evals the url component and then appends the current root url if it is not a URL object - so at first glance the code looks like it _should_ work - however I now see that when importing less it calls evalForImport which means the path is only normalised by the node if its a URL - which is the cause of the problem. This may be a regression.\n3rd - It does look like a bug to me, although typically with a less import we don't put in `url()` functions, it should work just the same\n\nimo the fix should either be\na) in Import.evalForImport we should use evalPath and then the importer should assume its an absolute path / relative to the base less file\nb) pass a flag in evalForImport to sub nodes so that the base path doesn't get added - this way it only effects less imports, not all imports.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/54746548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":162201687,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2MjIwMTY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/162201687","actor":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-07T13:23:48Z","label":{"name":"Bug","color":"e10c02"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":162201697,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2MjIwMTY5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/162201697","actor":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-07T13:23:51Z","label":{"name":"Medium
