However, when I deploy to my staging server modifyVars does not seems to work quite right. What I've noticed is that in the xhr function the following line is called. \n\nsession_cache += data.replace(/@import .+?;/ig, '');\n\nMy main.less file is essentially a bootstrapper that imports several other less files using the @imports keyword. When the line of code above is executed, the imports are stripped out, and in the modifyVars function none of the css implemented in my less files is applied following my providing the updated variables. Everything works fine when deployed as long as I do not attempt to use modifyVars().\n\nThis seems to be related to local storage, which less is not using on my localhost.\n\nThanks,\n\nCorey\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":202736957,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwMjczNjk1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/202736957","actor":{"login":"javisantana","id":30147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana","html_url":"https://github.com/javisantana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javisantana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e0fe7bce17faf3e4780318375f1f5a2050bcc846","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CartoDB/carto/commits/e0fe7bce17faf3e4780318375f1f5a2050bcc846","created_at":"2014-12-04T16:34:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/498595083","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/346#issuecomment-498595083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/346","id":498595083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODU5NTA4Mw==","user":{"login":"naansun","id":45134482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTM0NDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45134482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun","html_url":"https://github.com/naansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-04T09:27:14Z","updated_at":"2019-06-04T09:27:14Z","body":"Do you have resolved this question?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/498595083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"naansun","id":45134482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTM0NDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45134482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun","html_url":"https://github.com/naansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
