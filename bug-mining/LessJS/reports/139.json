As of now, it worked pretty well, however Bootstrap 3 came out and the grid system changed completely, including a new mixin that allows you to create your own column classesm, cf [the doc](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-less).\n\nThe problem is the following:\n\nGiven the following code, it works perfectly fine\n\n``` css\n@import \"less/bootstrap.less\";\n\n.passport-body {\n  .make-column(9);\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n``` css\n/* here comes the whole bootstrap world that I omitted to paste */\n.passport-body {\n  position: relative;\n  min-height: 1px;\n  padding-left: 15px;\n  padding-right: 15px;\n}\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n  .passport-body {\n    float: left;\n    width: 75%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever if I try to make some reference import, here is what I get\n\n``` css\n@import (reference) \"less/bootstrap.less\";\n\n.passport-body {\n  .make-column(9);\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n``` css\n.passport-body {\n  position: relative;\n  min-height: 1px;\n  padding-left: 15px;\n  padding-right: 15px;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the media query part was dropped.\n\nI don't know if this is a bug or a feature, but in any case this is an annoying behavior because it makes it hard to use bootstrap's mixins this way.\n\nAlso I'm sorry I couldn't provide a live example, however I'm not using a stable version, which might be why there is a bug :)\n\nFor information, I use the commit 4bedef4fd3748257cf04a42c8e0181c0116d754b of lessc\n\nMany thanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
