[SmartyP](https://github.com/SmartyP)**\n_Friday Jun 08, 2012 at 16:09 GMT_\n_Originally opened as https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/1015_\n\n----\n\nI'm noticing with sprint-9 that Brackets won't load properly out of the \"Program Files (x86)\" folder on Windows. Brackets opens, but the code editor area and the 'JSLint errors' area do not show anything.\n\nI verified this on two Windows 7 machines, and further nailed it down to be the parenthesis in the folder name. You can repro this by extracting to a \"test' folder on the root of the drive - it works fine there - but if you change the folder name to \"test ()\" Brackets will stop working properly. \n\nThis issue doesn't exist in the sprint 8 release.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues/issues/1009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues/issues/1009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"core-ai-bot","id":86966019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTY2MDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86966019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/core-ai-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/core-ai-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-29T15:50:31Z","updated_at":"2021-08-29T15:50:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues/issues/1014","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues/issues/1014/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues/issues/1014/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues/issues/1014/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues/issues/1014","id":982134110,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5ODIxMzQxMTA=","number":1014,"title":"[CLOSED]

properly in a folder with parenthesis)\n\nWork around LESS bug (https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/issues/831) by putting quotes around all relative URLs in our LESS files (except for URLs importing other LESS files, which are not subject to the bug since they're not preserved in the final output).\n\nThis just fixes the one URL in our current code that's subject to the bug.  If we're ok with a bigger diff and really want to cement the best practice, we could also add quotes to all our remaining URLs too (those that import LESS files), so that there are no bad examples in the code for people to follow...\n\n\n----\n\n_**[peterflynn](https://github.com/peterflynn)** included the following code: https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/1020/commits_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues/issues/1014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brackets-archive/bracketsIssues/issues/1014/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
