Hmm, that might be a problem, at least I also feel like this stuff is not quite natural part of the compiler... (It's quite fun bureaucracy, who could think that generating a few characters may become such a pain :) \n\nP.S.Technically, grunt-contrib-less uses tree.toCSS and thus is free to prepend anything to the CSS result, what \"API conflict\" it could be? (And grunt-contrib-less will have to be aware of and handle such option even if it's implemented in the compiler, what actual difference it could be? I mean it looks like it will be alsmost the same code for grunt-contrib-less to handle it via less.js or to handle it on its own, or do I miss something as my always?).
