would it be possible to generate a dependency tree without actually parsing the Less (i.e., just generating the paths).\n\nThe reason I ask is because I've set up an automatic build system that compiles the Less files to CSS on the fly. The way it works is fairly simple:\n1. Check modification time on all .less files for a given HTTP request.\n2. Loop through all required less files, keeping track of latest mod time.\n3. Compare the last mod time to the mod time on the cached file.\n4. If there is a change, then trigger the rebuild process (i.e., call lessc).\n\nThis way, the build process is all server side, and our developers can just share the Less compiler sitting on our dev box.\n\nThis is easy to maintain as long as the less follows a very specific folder structure, like app/less/$section/*.less. But it isn't always that simple... less imports can call code from many different locations.\n\nThe problem I see is that it  would be expensive to check dependencies **and** compile the code. Is it currently possible to allow simple generating a dependency tree without lots of re-factoring?

much.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/62818261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"avindra","id":126848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra","html_url":"https://github.com/avindra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avindra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/62833048","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1799#issuecomment-62833048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1799","id":62833048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODMzMDQ4","user":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-13T02:51:07Z","updated_at":"2014-11-13T05:52:57Z","body":">
