It uses the scope active on the place where the mixin is used.\n\nOther variables used in mixin behave differently:\n- If the variable have been defined in the top-level scope then it is replaced by top level definition. Redefinition in lower scope is ignored.\n- If the variable have not been defined in the top-level scope, then lower level scope definition is used.\n\nIt seems a bit inconsistent, is it how it should be? I would expect the undefined variable to throw an exception and the default variable to use top level scope.\n\nExample:\n\n<pre><code>@parameterDefault: 'top level';\n@anotherVariable: 'top level';\n//mixin uses top-level variables\n.mixinNoParam(@parameter: @parameterDefault) {\n  default: @parameter;\n  scope: @anotherVariable;\n  undefined: @undefined;\n}\n\n#allAreUsedHere {\n  //redefine top-level variables in different scope\n  @parameterDefault: 'inside';\n  @anotherVariable: 'inside';\n  @undefined: 'inside';\n  //use the mixin\n  .mixinNoParam();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\nActual output: \n\n<pre><code>#allAreUsedHere {\n  default: 'inside';\n  scope: 'top level';\n  undefined: 'inside';\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\nExpected output (if we remove the 'undefined' line):\n\n<pre><code>#allAreUsedHere {\n  default: 'top level';\n  scope: 'top level';\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\nNote: tested on less-1.3.0.js. \n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/973/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
