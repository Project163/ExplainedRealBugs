We have a form that generates variables based on user input and defines the variables. The variable in question is either blank or a hex value. I have something similar to the following in the .less file:\n\n```\n& when (iscolor(VARIABLE)) {\n\n.class .class:selected {\n     background: VARIABLE;\n     }\n\n.class .class:hover {\n     background: lighten(VARIABLE, 50%);\n     }\n}\n```\n\nWhen the code runs to compile the file when a color is not specified (and the variable is blank), it throws an error that it can't evaluate the tohsl() function because the variable is not a color.\n\nI would have thought that the is color guard would skip the contents of the brackets since the variable isn't a color. Am I mistaken? What could I be doing wrong? Thanks for anything you can suggest.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1873/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
