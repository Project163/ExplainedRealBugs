For this I use plain node `script` in `package.json` (I know about and also use Grunt/Gulp in other configs).\n\nThe particular task looks something like this (uses `npm i -g watch`) :\n\n```\n    watch 'lessc --source-map --autoprefix --verbose /less/main.less /bundle.css' /less/\n```\n\nConsole output :\n\n```\n    > Watching /less/\n    > app@3.2.1 build:css /app\n    > lessc --source-map --verbose --autoprefix /less/main.less /style.css\n\n    lessc: wrote /style.css\n    lessc: wrote /style.css.map\n```\n\nI really like having the info on what was done (or at least some feedback like now), so I was wondering why is the `--verbose` option being depecrated (as per the `--help`) ? Is there going to be some alternative ? Are there any thoughts on exposing this info in some other way ? So that maybe a less-plugin-watch could output it to the user ?\n\n```\n    lessc --source-map --autoprefix --watch --verbose /less/main.less /style.css\n```\n\nIf anything I would like it enhanced with bytes written and time spent, à la `browserify` with `watchify` :\n\n```\n    lessc: 4664 bytes written to /style.css (0.21 seconds)\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
