Three values should be supported:\n- **width** – Returns the width of the image, including the `px` unit\n- **height** – Returns the height of the image, including the `px` unit\n- **size** – Returns the height of the image, including the `px` unit (**default**)\n\nWith this I could specify the following code easily:\n\n```\n.logo {\n    background: url( 'logo.png' ) no-repeat top left;\n    background-size: image-size( 'logo.png' );\n\n    @media ONLY min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5 {\n        background-image: url( 'logo@2x.png' );\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
