is not a requirement for embedding SVG (or any resource). You can do html encoding.\n\nWhat might be cool is to create a kind of declarative option for svg, where someone could write something like the following and \"compile\" it into a data-uri embed:\n\n```\n  svg {\n    linearGradient {\n      stop {\n        offset: 0;\n        stop-color: @color1;\n      }\n      stop {\n        offset: 1;\n        stop-color: @color2;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nAdmittedly, I stole this idea from @jonschlinkert.\n\nSVGs are tremendously powerful but a little hard to manipulate via code. While they're not highly used yet, I think as soon as IE8 is \"dead\", we'll see them take over in a huge way due to their incredible flexibility as an image format. You can do insanely useful things with them that web developers haven't even scratched the surface of. So we could be a little forward thinking and think of how to make LESS useful for SVG-based styling. (So core support may not be so crazy in a year's time.)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/20574637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":55498349,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTU0OTgzNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/55498349","actor":{"login":"jonschlinkert","id":383994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mzk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/383994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert","html_url":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-07-07T18:06:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":55498351,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU1NDk4MzUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/55498351","actor":{"login":"jonschlinkert","id":383994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mzk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/383994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert","html_url":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-07-07T18:06:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":57377450,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU3Mzc3NDUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/57377450","actor":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cff0faa45dbb1811759034419cc3f6b307e39fad","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/les
