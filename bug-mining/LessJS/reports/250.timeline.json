think a decision needs to be made about what happens if the response is empty. If the desired behaviour is to keep going, then resolving a promise with something like `{ contents: body || '', ...}` [here](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/packages/less/src/less-node/url-file-manager.js#L41) should suffice, or alternatively the promise should be rejected. Returning an empty string without attempting to follow the redirect feels weird to me though - it's even worse than simply rejecting a promise. Like, it's ok to not implement something, but it's not ok to implement something knowingly broken.\r\n\r\nSo I would either reject a promise in `UrlFileManager.loadFile()` with an error saying UrlFileManager doesn't support redirects, or would replace `native-requests` with something that knows how to follow redirects and then would return an empty string. But, honestly, rejecting in the second case is also fine, after all if there's no body after all the redirects then there's something wrong with the resource user pointed to.\r\n\r\nRegarding other HTTP client libraries, [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) seems to be on the raise.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/749740837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zaquest","id":577334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/577334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest","html_url":"https://github.com/zaquest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaquest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/750426131","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/3576#issuecomment-750426131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3576","id":750426131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDQyNjEzMQ==","user":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-23T18:44:35Z","updated_at":"2020-12-23T18:44:35Z","body":"@zaquest This isn't a use-case I use, so either solution sounds good.
