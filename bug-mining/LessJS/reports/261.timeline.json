I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the less.js team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThis error happens because LESS 4.4.1 enforces stricter CSS media query syntax. The parser now requires a space between the media type and the feature, so `@media print(max-width: 992px)` is invalid and should be written as `@media print and (max-width: 992px)`. Without the space and the `and`, LESS emits CSS like `print(max-width: 992px)`, which downstream tools (like lightningcss) interpret as a function call, causing the build to fail with an \"Unexpected token Function('print')\" error. \n\nTo fix this, update your LESS to use the standard syntax: `@media print and (max-width: 992px)` or `@media (print) and (max-width: 992px)` [reference](https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/4331).\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

(Unfortunately, this is still clunky, it's changed at package.json in root, and in /packages/less/ for historical reasons)\r\n- Update the Changelog\r\n- Run grunt dist - (Also clunky -- in a perfect world, we would not be committing dist files, but there are also tricky backwards compatibility problems which caused this initially.)\r\n- Commit changed files to branch.\r\n- Submit a PR to this repo.\r\n\r\nAlso tried to mirror https://github.com/less/less.js/pull/3814\r\n\r\n<!-- Why are these changes necessary? -->\r\n\r\n**Why**:\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/4362 which is a regression caused by a more generalized approach to CSS functions.\r\n\r\n<!-- Have you done all of these things?  -->\r\n\r\n**Checklist**:\r\n\r\n<!-- add \"N/A\" to the end of each line that's irrelevant to your changes -->\r\n<!-- to check an item, place an \"x\" in the box like so: \"- [x] Documentation\" -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [ ] Added/updated unit tests\r\n- [ ] Code complete\r\n\r\n<!-- feel free to add additional comments -->\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/4364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/4364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/3366965241","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/4362#issuecomment-3366965241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/4362","id":3366965241,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAgNHM7Ir8_5","user":{"login":"kgetz-arista","id":204381389,"node_id":"U_kgDODC6czQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/204381389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista","html_url":"https://github.com/kgetz-arista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgetz-arista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-03T19:32:15Z","updated_at":"2025-10-03T19:32:15Z","body":"Is this fix going to be released soon?
