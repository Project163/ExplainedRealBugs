Recalling how custom at-rules are parsed, I guess the problem here is that the parser does not even triy to parse anything between `@-moz-document` and *first* `{` as something meaningful (i.e. quotes has no expected effect here at all), and this is sort of expected since the parser has absolutely no idea of what syntax this custom at-rule may have... Thus it may be quite tricky to fix.\r\n \r\nFor the same reason (\"unknown grammar\") the workaround with `@regexp` won't work simply because it won't mean a variable there (in general *nothing* after `@unknown-at-rule` and before the first `{` is considered to be a Less code).\r\nI.e. this construction is essentially parsed as:\r\n```less\r\n@-moz-document regexp(\"(\\d {\r\n    0,15})\") {\r\n        a {\r\n            color: red;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAnd the only workarounds I can invent at quick glance in this case would be either a separate file injected with `(inline)`  or something awful like:\r\n```less\r\n@mzd: ~'-{} @-moz-document regexp(\"(\\d{0,15})\")';\r\n\r\n@keyframes @mzd {\r\n    a {\r\n        color: red;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor sort
