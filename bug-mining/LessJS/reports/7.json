What is non-inuitive is that you cannot escape the value, or do anything to prevent it trying to find it except add '.css' to the end of the url, and since it isn't really a .css but rather a part of a request that is not a valid option.\n\nIt would be awesome to be able to do something like:\n\n`@import !url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans);`\n\nor similar to tell lessc to ignore the url, not try and resolve it, just echo it.\n\nIs this a valid point or am I missing a simpler solution? :P\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"cloudhead","id":40774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudhead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudhead/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
