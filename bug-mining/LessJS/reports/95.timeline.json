which allows us to update the base library without overwriting our own changes.\n\nHowever this adds a lot of extra code we don't need.\n\nWhat I'm proposing woud be an additional method to how @import works. @extend would allow you to make changes to a specific file and it would overwrite the default options with your changes. \n## Example:\n\n**Updated based on comments to better illustrate usage**\n### myFirstFile.less:\n\n``` css\nbody {\n     background:#000;\n     color: #fff;\n     font: 100% Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n\n.container {\n     width:940px;\n}\n\n.first, .second {\n    background: orange;\n}\n\n.first {\n    color: red;\n}\n\n.second {\n    color: green;\n}\n```\n### mySecondFile.less\n\n``` css\n@extend \"myFirstFile.less\";\n\nbody {\n     color: #f00;\n     font-size:13px;\n}\n\n.container {\n     color: pink;\n     width: 960px;\n}\n\n.first {\n    color: #000;\n    background: red;\n}\n```\n### Output file mySecondFile.css\n\n``` css\nbody {\n     background:#000;\n     color: #f00;\n     font: 13px Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n\n.container {\n     color: pink;\n     width:960px;\n}\n\n.first, .second {\n    background: orange;\n}\n\n.first {\n    color: #000;\n    background: red;\n}\n\n.second {\n    color: green;\n}\n```\n\nThis would make our files much smaller while allowing us to decouple our changes from the main .LESS files.\n\nSorry if this is not the preferred way to suggest this change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/772/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/15272427","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1210#issuecomment-15272427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1210","id":15272427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjcyNDI3","user":{"login":"jonschlinkert","id":383994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mzk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/383994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert","html_url":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-21T23:15:51Z","updated_at":"2013-03-21T23:15:51Z","body":"What

I don't think it will ever be a command line option\n\nThat makes sense, but I have a related idea that I'd like to get your thoughts though. And I'm not sure if I should create another issue or feature request for this yet... I'd like your feedback on it and your help in clarifying what the actual request is and if you think I should create a request then I will.\n\nOkay, the \"mute\" feature is clearly for importing external files, but it's particularly well-suited for importing 3rd-party libraries that you don't want to have to \"touch\". This makes life super easy, it's extremely powerful. IMO it gets orders of magnitude more powerful if we can leverage this feature to make it even easier to import arbitrary external libraries _and without having to directly add the import statements inside any `.less` files_.  In other words, I would love to be able to expand this feature (or a new one?) to allow referencing external LESS files programmatically without actually touching an import statement. \n\nI came up with a few different non-less.js hacks/workarounds to do this (using [assemble-less](http://github.com/assemble/assemble-less) in particular), but I'm wondering if there is a better, native Less.js solution that could work similarly to the `paths` option, or leverage it. Maybe `silentPaths`?  Hope this makes sense, I think it could be a big feature for 3rd party compilers to leverage.

I initially liked \"mute\", but after having third person tell me they hate it and that they don't see how it explains what the feature does, I think we should change it. All three people (including @cowboy), said they think the name should imply mixins or extends. That was my initial suggestion when we discussed this early on, and I still it makes a lot of sense. \n\nEven though this feature can be used via mixins or extends, when \"muted\" styles are _extended_, the behavior is virtually identical to how I described \"extending mixins\". Point being that, even though one might be using `:extend()`, on the imported files, the behavior of the external file itself - or rather the styles within the external files - is still exactly like mixins. \n\nI'm of the opinion that we should change the keyword to mixin or mixins: `@import (mixins) \"any-file.less\";`. Whether or not this is technically true from a purist standpoint doesn't matter one iota. \n\nFrom a documentation, education, feature description, and usability standpoint though, how easy and f'ing cool is it to say: \"This feature enables you to turn any external library into a set of implicit mixins\".
