Less makes this very easy to do.  One little tweak would make this feature perfect.\n\nCurrently, less does uri-encoding for data-uris. For example,\n\n`background-image: data-uri('image/svg+xml', 'myicon.svg');`\n\nresults in \n\n`background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml%20version%3D%221.0%22%20encoding%3D%22utf-8%22%3F%3E%0A%3C!--%20Generator%3A%20Adobe%20Illustrator%2018.0.0%2C%20SVG%20Export%20Plug-In%20.%20SVG%20Version%3A%206.00%20Build%200)%20%20--%3E%0A%3C!DOCTYPE%20svg%20PUBLIC%20%22-%2F%2FW3C%2F%2FDTD%20SVG%201.1%2F%2FEN%22%20%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FGraphics%2FSVG%2F1.1%2FDTD%2Fsvg11.dtd%22%3E%0A%3Csvg%20version%3D%221.1%22%20id%3D%22Layer_1%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Axlink%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1999%2Fxlink%22%20x%3D%220px`...\n\nWhile this works fine, it appears the URI encoding is not necessary, according to the [css 2.1 spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#uri).  The result is difficult to read and larger than necessary, perhaps larger than the base64 encoded version. Instead, simply escape single- and double-quotes, parenthesis and whitespace.\n\n@JonFerraiolo\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/65134616","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2250#issuecomment-65134616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2250","id":65134616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTM0NjE2","user":{"login":"stevenvachon","id":170197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenvachon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenvachon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-01T21:06:55Z","updated_at":"2014-12-01T21:06:55Z","body":"Compass

       background-image: data-uri('image.svg');\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should output something like\n\n```\n .image{\n    background-image: url('../image.png');\n  }\n  .svg .image {\n    background-image:

 }\n```\n\nInitially, I downgraded gulp-less to gulp-less@1.3.6 and this fixed the issue, I then incrementally upgraded through the gulp-less versions until the css output looked wrong again, and I found that immediately upgrading to gulp-less@1.3.7 caused the issue to appear.\n\nSo that fixed the gulp-less issue, but then I checked my old build tool, I used Koala and had it set to use the local/system less compiler and checking the installed version that was less@2.4.0 and I was getting the same data-uri compile issue.\n\nAgain I downgraded my local less back to less@1.7.5 and the outputted css complied as expected.\nI've then incrementally upgraded thorough the versions of less and tested the compile using koala and found that version less@2.0.0 caused the issue.\n\nIs the change in output an intended feature and I've missed a setting, or a bug?\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T17:32:06Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T17:32:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3105","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3105/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3105/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3105/events","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/3105","id":259884989,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNTk4ODQ5ODk=","number":3105,"title":"[Feature

(See: #2250 and #2184)  There are a few additional optimizations in URL encoding that can make the encoding even smaller, as discovered by the research on that article. This is an improvement since URL-encoding by itself can inflate the output greater than base64 encoding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3105/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19959220147,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAgNHM4CyszezwAAAASlqYez","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/19959220147","actor":{"login":"thorstone137","id":343876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Mzg3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137","html_url":"https://github.com/thorstone137","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstone137/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"11fd6b17dcc01dfe8233ac2a6d6b2b9d11547894","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thorstone137/less.js/commits/11fd6b17dcc01dfe8233ac2a6d6b2b9d11547894","created_at":"2025-09-27T14:33:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
