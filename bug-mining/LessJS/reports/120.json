Since the 1.4 change, this no longer works - lessc just fails to complete as it goes through the loop.\n\nTest Files:\n\n**a.less:**\n\n``` less\n@import \"b.less\";\n```\n\n**b.less:**\n\n``` less\n@import \"a.less\";\n```\n\n**Command to run:**\n\n```\nlessc a.less\n```\n\nI'm not sure if this is intended behaviour now, but the behaviour of `@import` is not the same as `@import-once` once was.  Tested using 1.4.2.\n\nIf you're wondering why anyone would run this, it's an easy way of getting intellisense to work in Visual Studio for mixins and variables declared in other less files.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1484/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
