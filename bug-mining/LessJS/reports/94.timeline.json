The ability to include a less file, but not output anything - just make the classes available as mixins.\n\nso here are some options.\n\n```\n @import (multiple: true, less: true, include: true) \"file.less\" (min-width:400px);\n```\n\ndownsides are its a bit confusing with the media query syntax. we could also put the options second and mix them with the media query, defining our own special media query options essentially, but I don't like that in case we conflict in the future with css.\n\nfrom @jonschlinkert \n\n```\n@options (multiple: true, less: true, include: true) {\n    @import \"file.less\" (min-width: 400px);\n}\n```\n\nand variations on the above, such as using closer media query syntax like\n\n```\n@import (multiple: true) and (less: true) \"file.less\";\n```\n\nI initially disliked @jonschlinkert's options idea, but it does actually allow for setting defaults.. what I don't like is that it looks a bit verbose.\n\nwe could also assume `:true` and have\n\n```\n@import (multiple, less) \"file.less\" (min-width:400px);\n```\n\nand I am open to any other suggestions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/15263158","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1209#issuecomment-15263158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1209","id":15263158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjYzMTU4","user":{"login":"atomi","id":83137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi","html_url":"https://github.com/atomi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atomi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-21T20:25:43Z","updated_at":"2013-03-21T20:25:43Z","body":"I
