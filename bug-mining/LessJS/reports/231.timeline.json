I think at the moment I am in favour of initially expanding strictMaths to be\n> \n> Off\n> Division\n> On\n> and then for 2.0.0 setting the default to be Division\n\nSorry I didn't respond to this before 2.0 was released. I think that's a good instinct. Naked division operators simply conflict with too much of CSS, and will conflict more and more as people use more CSS3 features. And I understand people's pushback to not require parens for all math, since it's not needed in many cases.\n\n@seven-phases-max \n\n>  it is allowed to accept 16/17, and then evaluating 16/17 before it is passed to a function would be incorrect\n\nStrictly speaking, yes that's absolutely correct. This should not be evaluated BEFORE it reaches the function, especially for a custom one. However, I think it would be smart to allow functions to opt to process arguments like this, if it makes sense. So, percentage would receive 16/17 as a text argument, and then the percentage function could make a call to some helper function to see if the text is math. In the case of percentage, the argument is not ambiguous. A CSS3 declaration is not valid here. So, other user-defined functions could operate the same way: opt to evaluate arguments for valid math equations. Therefore, it's not necessarily true that strict math \"forces\" a double parentheses in this case. I think to suggest that causes some pushback on the idea of strict math, that it must, as a necessity, be verbose in all
