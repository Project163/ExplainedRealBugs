It's actually more about _requiring_ outer parens after `when` and for anything else parens to be optional. But in either case this would mean a breaking change.\nI.e.:\n- with \"required outer parens\", currently valid `when (true) and (true) or (true)` becomes illegal\n- with \"optional outer parens\", too ambiguous stuff  like `when true, true > false` comes in (since`true > false` is also a selector).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/181103021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/181124666","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/2798#issuecomment-181124666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2798","id":181124666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTEyNDY2Ng==","user":{"login":"SomMeri","id":618879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODg3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri","html_url":"https://github.com/SomMeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-07T21:43:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-07T21:43:45Z","body":"I recall that `when` is allowed only in rulesets with one selector, so that concrete example of optional outer parens should not be ambigous.

Interestingly, these works: `.test when (8+4 < 13) {}`\n\nYes, I suppose this is because when we have the first inner parens in `when ((x) < 3)` the parser enters `condition() -> conditionAnd()` and stops [here](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/lib/less/parser/parser.js#L1623) thus still returning properly parsed `(x)` value ( stored as `(x = true)` condition), but next comes only `< 3` which isn't already parseable (since neither of [comparision operands](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/lib/less/parser/parser.js#L1654) can be a `condition()`, thus the parser can't even try the other way around). <- well, roughly...\n\nAnd the reverted expression works simply because the parser instantly goes down to `this.addition()` and \"incomplete `and`/`or` values\" don't interfere there.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/181418875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-11T03:15:21Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T03:15:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2806","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2806/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2806/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2806/events","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/pull/2806","id":131804381,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTg1MDY4Mzk=","number":2806,"title":"Fix
