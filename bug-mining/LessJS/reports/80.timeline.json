This has some unfortunate side effects:\n\nIf two or more comments in the same block are equal, even though the rules they belong to are different, all but one of the comments will be removed.\n\nAlso, processed code may become harder to read, for two reasons: 1) Some comments are missing, and 2) comments are moved so that they seem to belong to the code following them instead of the code before them.\n\nFurthermore, other pre-processing tools using comments for meta information will get problems, if they are run after LESS in the toolchain (which may be desirable, as LESS concatenates files).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/13325732","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1067#issuecomment-13325732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1067","id":13325732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMzI1NzMy","user":{"login":"fleaflicker","id":682081,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY4MjA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/682081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker","html_url":"https://github.com/fleaflicker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleaflicker/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-09T03:46:25Z","updated_at":"2013-02-09T03:46:25Z","body":"I
