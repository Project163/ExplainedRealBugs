Plus working out the extends chaining as a tree before adding new extends in order to do proper circular reference checking would make it easier.. but I have limited time to spend on this and less isn't performance critical unless you are using it in a browser in production and we don't recommend doing that no matter what you use in your

on a another check, I think maybe we should adopt an easy way of inheritance, ie simple single inheritance, just for the sake of simplicity. :)\nThere's gonna be an issue if C extends B, and B extends
