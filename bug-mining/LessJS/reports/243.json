The below code used to work in less 2.x. \r\n \r\n``` \r\nconst less = require('less');\r\nconst raw = ` @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700');`;\r\n\r\nless.render(raw, { processImports: false })\r\n    .then(() => console.info('Less ok!'))\r\n    .catch(error => console.error('Less failed!', error));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen trying this with less 3.11.1 it fails with `TypeError: Cannot read property 'rules' of undefined` on the following less-code from `less.cjs.js`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nelse {\r\n  ruleset = new Ruleset(null, copyArray(this.root.rules));\r\n  ruleset.evalImports(context);\r\n  return this.features ? new Media(ruleset.rules, this.features.value) : ruleset.rules;\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n`this.root` seems to be `undefined`. I'm just wondering if it's something I did wrong on my end or that it's a bug we can fix?\r\n\r\nSetting processImports to true > Ok\r\nAdding more css/less > Same error.\r\n\r\nManaged to fix it by changing the less code to\r\n```\r\nelse if (this.root) {\r\n  ruleset = new Ruleset(null, copyArray(this.root.rules));\r\n  ruleset.evalImports(context);\r\n  return this.features ? new Media(ruleset.rules, this.features.value) : ruleset.rules;\r\n} else { return []; }\r\n```\r\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best approach here, there might be an underlying bug somewhere.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3504/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
