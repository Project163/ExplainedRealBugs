Silent continue to do this, but marks the contents as silent, so they can be referenced but not output. e.g.\n\n```\n//file.less\n.a { color: black; }\n.b .c.d { color: white; }\n\n//main.less\n@import \"file.less\";\n.e { .a; }\n.f:extend(.b .c.d) {}\n```\n\ncurrent output...\n\n```\n.a { color: black; }\n.b .c.d,\n.f { color: white; }\n.e { color: black; }\n```\n\noutput with silent (`@import (silent) \"file.less\";`)\n\n```\n.f { color: white; }\n.e { color: black; }\n```\n\nI see this as every selector in file.less is silenced, but if it is referenced it doesn't stop the use of it from being silent. I imagine this like a silent boolean property on root level selectors and directives - if a new selector is added to a ruleset then it still gets output.\n\nusecase - powerful refactoring/ use of libraries.\n\nonly valid with a less file\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
