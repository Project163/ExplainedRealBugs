the new data-uri function (when called from command line) loads files relative to the working directory, not the less file.\n\nI think this is a bit counterintuitive to how @imports and relative urls work, and would like it to either load relative to the less file or at least use the search paths. \n\nFrom what I've gathered by reading the source, that would mean assigning the filename/paths in tree.parseEnv and use this information in data-uri.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
