Less.js doesn't have any trouble on prefixed at-rules. However, trying to future-proof my CSS I included an unprefixed version, and that's where the parser has trouble.\n\nThis example shows multiple problems:\n\n```\n@media all and (min-aspect-ratio: 5468/7443) and (max-aspect-ratio: 51/40),      /* 1.25 */\n       all and (min-aspect-ratio: 40/51) and (max-aspect-ratio: 9/10),           /* 1.25 */\n       all and (min-aspect-ratio: 2889/2000) and (max-aspect-ratio: 31/20),      /* 1.5 */\n       all and (min-aspect-ratio: 20/31) and (max-aspect-ratio: 2000/2889)       /* 1.5 */\n{}\n```\n\nLess.js seems to have trouble with comments, `aspect-ratio`, `min-aspect-ratio`, `max aspect-ratio`, and ratio values. It only parses once I remove all those things.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
