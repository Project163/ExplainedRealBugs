I'm somewhat surprised that node.js hasn't added this feature to its standard fs module.\n\nUnfortunately, the improvement you added to create the immediate parent output directory is insufficient for our specific build requirements because of the hierarchical organization of our stylesheets.  However, it's relatively simple (though somewhat irritating) to workaround that limitation by adding some additional Ant tasks in our build scripts that leverage lessc.\n\nOut of curiosity, is it your goal to avoid _any_ additional node.js module dependencies aside from the standard set of node.js modules?
