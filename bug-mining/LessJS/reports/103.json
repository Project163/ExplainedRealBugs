}\n.header .header-nav:before { background: blue; }\n```\n\nAnd adding:\n\n``` LESS\n.footer {\n    .footer-nav {\n        &:extend( .header .nav all );\n    }\n}\n```\n\nShould compile to:\n\n``` LESS\n.header .header-nav, .footer .footer-nav { background: red; }\n.header .header-nav:before, .footer .footer-nav:before { background: blue; }\n```\n\nbut I'm getting:\n\n``` LESS\n.header .header-nav, .footer .footer-nav { background: red; }\n.header .header-nav:before, .footer .footer-nav { background: blue; }\n```\n\nSo I'm not sure exactly how :extend() handles inheriting from nesting, and I tried reviewing the \"test\" cases, but they don't have an example that quite works the way I've been utilizing it.\n\nI do know however I feel it's an issue with the parent **&** selector, as if I were to replace **&:before** with say a class ex: .before{} I get the \"expected\" output.\n\nIf I leave out the **.header** in the include from :extend(), then the &:before works correctly, but it then adds .header to the entire include of extend:\n\n``` LESS\n.footer {\n    .footer-nav {\n        &:extend( .header-nav all );\n    }\n}\n```\n\ncompiles to:\n\n``` LESS\n.header .header-nav, .header .footer .footer-nav { background: red; }\n.header .header-nav:before, .header .footer .footer-nav:before { background: blue; }\n```\n\nSo there I'm getting my desired inheritance of :before, but an unwanted .header parent to .footer .footer-nav.\n\nIt may just be my mis-interpretation of :extend(), but was just hoping for some clarification.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1404/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
