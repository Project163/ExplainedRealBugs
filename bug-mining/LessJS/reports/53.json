(or, you know, maybe something a bit more pertinent to your site...)</h3></p>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nLESS code:\n\n```\n@import \"elements\";\n\n.alert {\n   background: ~\"#fff6bf url(images/exclamation.png) 15px center no-repeat\";\n   text-align: left;\n   padding: 10px 20px 10px 50px;\n   border-top: 2px solid #ffd324;\n   border-bottom: 2px solid #ffd324;\n   .box-shadow(0 1px 2px #999999);\n}\n```\n\nRunning this gives me a `c is undefined` error in the less file, around line 8/9 of the Less library? I know it is something to do with the @import that is causing the problem, as removing it works absolutely fine. I've also tried creating new files, as the elements.less file is a pre-built one from lesselements.com - this doesn't make any difference: I still get the same error. The elements.less file is being pulled in for the box-shadow class in the above code.\n\nI'm using Textpad 6.0 with Firefox 16 as my browser - any one got any ideas as to what I am doing wrong please?\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
