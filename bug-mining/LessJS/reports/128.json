This may not be the case if sourceMapBasepath is specified through grunt-contrib-less and the Gruntfile is used on both Windows and *n.x. Normalizing this._sourceMapBasepath before the indexOf call would fix the problem.\n\nWorkaround: in the grunt-less-contrib options, set the sourceMapBasepath property using require('path').normalize(mySourceMapBasepath).\n\nMy env: LESS 1.5.0 called through grunt-contrib-less 0.8.1 running on Win 7 Enterprise SP1 64-bit.
