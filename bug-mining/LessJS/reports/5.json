The base path is attached to the url('data:image/...') which results in invalid css like url('http://internal.localdomain/data:image/...')\n\nI fixed it by changing line 2192 from \n\n<pre>\nif (!/^(?:https?:\\/|file:\\/)?\\//.test(val.value) && paths.length > 0 && typeof(window) !== 'undefined') {\n</pre>\n\n\nto\n\n<pre>\nif (val.value.indexOf('data:') !== 0 && !/^(?:https?:\\/|file:\\/)?\\//.test(val.value) && paths.length > 0 && typeof(window) !== 'undefined') { \n</pre>\n\nof course a better check than this would be more solid, but I just needed it to work until it's fixed.
