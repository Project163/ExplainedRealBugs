A correct error is thrown, but the error handling code fails and a different error message is displayed.\n\nOnce a file is imported, its path is discarded and only its filename is saved for future reference. However, the content of the files is saved in an object where the whole path is used as a key. If the imported LESS files then contain errors, the error message function tries to fetch the correct line from the object which contains source file contents. It fails, because it tries to use filename as a key instead of a path and thus 'undefined' is returned.\n\nPlease see [the complete demostration and a partial workaround here](http://konsepto.fi/bugs/less-relative-path-bug/) or [download it as a zip package](http://konsepto.fi/bugs/less-relative-path-bug/less-relative-path-bug.zip).\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
