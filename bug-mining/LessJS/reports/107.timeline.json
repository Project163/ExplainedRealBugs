the error about must be a string is because it is already a color - you do not need the color function.. e.g.\n\n```\n@original-color: #ff0000;\n@pre: original;\n\n.test() {\n  .test {\n    @var: \"@{pre}-color\";\n    color: @@var;\n  }\n}\n\n.test();\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n@original-color: \"#ff0000\";\n@pre: original;\n\n.test() {\n  .test {\n    @var: \"@{pre}-color\";\n    color: color(@@var);\n  }\n}\n\n.test();\n```\n\nor if you don't know if its a string or a color\n\n```\n@original-color: #ff0000;\n@pre: original;\n\n.test() {\n  .test {\n    @var: \"@{pre}-color\";\n    @col: @@var;\n    color: color(\"@{col}\");\n  }\n}\n\n.test();\n```\n\nregarding interpolation working twice.. you are right.. I simplified your example. e.g.\n\n```\n@original-color: #ff0000;\n@pre: original;\n\n.test {\n  color: ~'@{@{pre}-color}';\n}\n\n.test() {\n  .test {\n    color: ~'@{@{pre}-color}';\n  }\n}\n\n.a {\n.test();\n}\n```\n\nnote how when it isn't a mixin it doesn't double interpolate. I think when it is a mixin the string is being evaluated twice, once when it is in the mixin and once when it is in its final location, magically giving you double interpolated strings. when you add the color function it is being evaluated once for the color function. so its a bug that it works at all..\n\nI can fix that and will have to think about whether we should support double interpolation.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/24563526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":65746467,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ2NTc0NjQ2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/65746467","actor":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-09-17T04:35:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/24790807","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1458#issuecomment-24790807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1458","id":24790807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzkwODA3","user":{"login":"srikanthmanian","id":5483674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODM2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanthmanian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanthmanian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-20T05:28:39Z","updated_at":"2013-09-20T05:30:52Z","body":"Hello,\n\nI am getting the same error - SyntaxError: error evaluating function `color`: argument must be a string.
