Should be zero, as the error message should be written to stderr.\n\n(This issue originally included that `lessc` wasn't setting an erroneous exit code. It seems I was testing it wrong, and `lessc` does do the right thing there. Not sure what I did...)\n\nOkay, edit 3: _some_ errors don't correctly set an exit code. Here's one example:\n\n```\n$ node_modules/.bin/lessc --include-path\ninclude-path option requires a parameter\n$ echo $?\n0\n```\n\nBut others do. An interesting roulette when using `lessc` from build scripts.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
