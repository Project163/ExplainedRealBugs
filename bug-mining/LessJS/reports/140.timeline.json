reopen this as I faced another \"`&` and mixin visibility\" issue which is basically the same but makes things even more uncertain because of its context.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n```\n#something {\n    & .a {\n        1: 1;\n    }\n\n    & { .a {\n        2: 2;\n    }}\n}\n\n.test {\n    #something > .a;\n}\n```\n\nBefore 1.6.2 only the first `.a` was matched, now (in the current master) both are matched. The new behaviour seems to be more expected in this case since both `.a` result in the same CSS selectors and it's not so easy to find a reason for them to work differently when searched for the mixin match. But this leads to another problems:\nBeside the initial example of this topic (which now looks even more questionable) there's also different behaviour of the same code with parametric mixins, e.g.:\n\n```\n#parathing() {\n    & .a {\n        1: 1;\n    }\n\n    & { .a {\n        2: 2;\n    }}\n}\n\n.test {\n    #parathing > .a; // matches only the first .a (same for current master and earlier versions)\n}\n```\n\nI bother with these examples because I'm working on some mixin matching improvement patch - and there the \"selector.match\" function (or one of its [internals](https://github.com/seven-phases-max/less.js/blob/mixin-match-improvement/lib/less/tree/selector.js#L43)) looks like the correct place to handle all this, but now I'm not sure what would be the right choice (i.e. I assume the consistent behaviour for all of above cases would be either \"always match\" or \"never match\"). \nSo I need some feedback :)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/36160982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":97119465,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ5NzExOTQ2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/97119465","actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-02-26T18:42:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":97122959,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDk3MTIyOTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/97122959","actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-02-26T18:51:12Z","label":{"name":"NeedsDecision","color":"5319e7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/36162192","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1877#issuecomment-36162192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1877","id":36162192,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTYyMTky","user":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","eve

Ah, I forgot to mention that the main goal of my patch is to enable \"matching for selectors concatenated across nesting boundary\" (see #1624 example) and to do that I reworked the whole `selector.match` thing to a method mentioned [there](https://github.com/less/less.js/pull/1831#discussion_r9178279) thus opening a room for further improvements (if any).

:))\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/36193265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":97229142,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTcyMjkxNDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/97229142","actor":{"login":"SomMeri","id":618879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODg3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri","html_url":"https://github.com/SomMeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-02-26T23:47:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":97229143,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk3MjI5MTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/events/97229143","actor":{"login":"SomMeri","id":618879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODg3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri","html_url":"https://github.com/SomMeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-02-26T23:47:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/36345291","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1877#issuecomment-36345291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/1877","id":36345291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzQ1Mjkx","user":{"login":"SomMeri","id":618879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODg3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri","html_url":"https://github.com/SomMeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SomMeri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-28T12:22:06Z","updated_at":"2014-02-28T12:22:06Z","body":"I

They generate the same css, but source less is different so it is ok for them to behave differently.\n- The `&{ }` is just special case of `.selector & .class`,so they should behave the same way. If one of them creates new scope, the other one should too.\n- I like the `&{ }` trick to create \"private\" variables and mixins, but that may be me being used to everything private from
