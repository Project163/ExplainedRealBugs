Too many exceptions in the future?\r\n\r\n@seven-phases-max :\r\nWell, there're a lot of other possibilities, e.g. `./` or require parens for division (e.g. `1/2`->`1/2` but `(1/2)`->`0.5`) etc... \r\nAlso, the \"special cases\" (e.g. properties where `x/y` can appear as shorthand) are not so rare (starting at `padding`/`margin` and ending with `background`/`border-radius` and eventually there can be [more](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/#animation-shorthand-property)) so we just can't hardcode them all like it's done for `font` (and because of that I think that the current font \"workaround\" is just a temporary and quite dirty kludge that ideally should be removed too).
