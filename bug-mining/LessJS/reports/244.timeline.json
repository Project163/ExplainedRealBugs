Less doesn't know what the function will do with the data. `if()` is (more or less) just a generic function, and arguments are always evaluated before the function is evaluated. Doing otherwise would be counter-intuitive, because the first argument _has_ to be evaluated. There's no special case where any given function evaluates a portion of arguments but not all arguments.\r\n\r\nSo, to me, this is 100% expected.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/471371497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matthew-dean","id":414752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-dean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthew-dean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/comments/471379371","html_url":"https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/3371#issuecomment-471379371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/3371","id":471379371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTM3OTM3MQ==","user":{"login":"seven-phases-max","id":5304376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5304376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max","html_url":"https://github.com/seven-phases-max","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seven-phases-max/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T01:56:11Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T01:56:11Z","body":">So, to me, this is 100% expected.\r\n\r\nYes, it is expected by the way functions are implemented.

kind of deprecation or conversion.\nSo for this version, this works again:</p>\n<pre><code>.mixin;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>This release has 2 breaking changes:</p>\n<h3>Parentheses required for mixin calls</h3>\n<p>This aligns it with syntax for calling detached rulesets.</p>\n<p>Example</p>\n<pre lang=\"less\"><code>.mixin() {}\n.mixin;  // error in 4.0\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Parens-division now the default math setting</h3>\n<p>Parentheses are required (by default) around division-like expressions, to force math evaluation.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"less\"><code>@ratio_large: 16;\n@ratio_small: 9;\n<p>/** The following will produce <code>device-aspect-ratio: 1.77777778</code> by default in 3.x */\n<a href=\"https://github.com/media\"><code>@​media</code></a> all and (device-aspect-ratio: <a href=\"https://github.com/ratio\"><code>@​ratio</code></a>_large / <a href=\"https://github.com/ratio\"><code>@​ratio</code></a>_small) {\n.body { max-width: 800px; }\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>Produces:</p>\n<pre lang=\"css\"><code>@media all and (device-aspect-ratio: 16 / 9) {\n  .body {\n    max-width: 800px;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can, of course, get old math behavior.
