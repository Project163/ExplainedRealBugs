Some examples are:\n\n``` LESS\n@media (min-width: 500px) {\n  .sometimes-big {\n    font-size: 5000px;\n  }\n```\n\n``` LESS\n@media (min-width: 500px)\n```\n\n``` LESS\n@media\n```\n\nThe missing block is also silently ignored when placed at the end of another block.  For example:\n\n``` LESS\n.sometimes-big {\n  font-size: 5000px;\n\n  @media (min-width: 500px)\n}\n\n.red {\n  font-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nAlthough the first behavior (silently ignoring unclosed blocks) is the only one which concerns me, I noticed the other behavior while investigating and felt it worth mentioning.\n\nIt appears both issues could be fixed by adding an `error()` when `.block()` returns falsey at [parser.js:1282](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/b3e065/lib/less/parser/parser.js#L1282), but this would trample some other error messages in the test suite and it wasn't apparent to me how to avoid that, so I hope you'll forgive the lack of a PR to address the issue.\n\nThanks for considering!\nKevin\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/2494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
