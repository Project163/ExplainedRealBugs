Instead of using a protocol-way like https://github.com/less/less-plugin-npm-import, I treat this as an opt-in: try to resolve an import via Bower first and fallback to the old behavior, if necessary. This works good, but there is one thing which would make it even easier: the `filename` param, which is passed to `supports`, `loadFile` and other functions has an auto-appended `.less` extension. Is it possible to get the filename without the extension?\n\nThere are some libraries using a `.less` extension in their registered Bower components names like\n- github.com/hyspace/typeahead.js-bootstrap3.less\n- github.com/sparanoid/core.less\n- github.com/sparanoid/keys.less\n- github.com/ProLoser/Flexbox.less\n- github.com/machito/animate.less and several others.\n\nSomeone could create a package with the same name, but without the extension like \"animate\", \"keys\", \"core\", etc. Because Less auto-appends `.less` I can't figure out what was the name the developer really choose.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n@import \"core\";  // will be `core.less` inside FileManager API\n@import \"core.less\";  // will be `core.less` inside FileManager API, too\n```\n\nI'm fine if `filename` would still have the auto-appended extension, if there would be a different way to access the original param (maybe another parameter or something like that).\n\nGreat work with version 2 so far!
