This: `something: (12 (13 + 10 -23));` compiles into `something: 12 23 -23;`. \n\nIs this a feature or a bug? The comma is treated differently and is not allowed inside parentheses: `something: (12,(13 + 10 -23));` leads to compile exception.\n\nI'm asking because I wanted to port less.js into java (https://github.com/SomMeri/less4j project) and would like to know whether:\n- this is a feature and I should copy the behavior,\n- this is a bug and I should report it as such.\n\nI'm using less.js-1.3.0 release as a reference version. I also hope you do not mind too much java port of the compiler. \n","closed_by":{"login":"lukeapage","id":309321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeapage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeapage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/less/less.js/issues/952/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
