scripting interaction with a simple subprocess, closing stdin is often the only recognized way to indicate that the input is complete and may be acted upon by the subprocess.\n\n```\nfrom subprocess import Popen, PIPE\np = Popen(['cat'], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)\np.stdin.write('Hello!\\n')\np.stdin.close()\nprint p.stdout.read()\n```\n\nUnfortunately, paramiko makes the above interaction nearly impossible with a remote `cat` because its channel's `stdin.close()` fails to actually cause a close of the file descriptor on the remote end.\n\nThis script hangs forever:\n\n```\nimport paramiko\nclient = paramiko.SSHClient()\nclient.connect('localhost', username='brandon')\nstdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('cat')\nstdin.write('Hello, world.\\n')\nstdin.close()  # fails to: channel.shutdown_write()\nprint stdout.read()\nclient.close()\n```\n\nFortunately, Stack Overflow indicated that this issue can be worked around by (as shown in the comment above) reaching into `stdin.channel` and performing the close manually. But it would be an improvement to paramiko for its own `close()` to natively implement the same behavior as local file descriptors show in `subprocess`.
