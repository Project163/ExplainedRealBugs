this out in various places in the docs, nothing fits perfectly so I gotta make a judgement call re: where fab, inv, invocations and patchwork are best mentioned.\r\n\r\n- Putting mention of all 4 in the README, when only 2 are truly required for use, feels like it could be throwing newbies too much at once.\r\n  - \"Oh man this is so complicated! 4 libraries just to run a single command?!?! Fuck this I'm going elsewhere\". 😢 \r\n- Conversely, having that high level view is useful and burying mention of it in the FAQs or a conceptual doc _also_ doesn't feel right – per this ticket's OP, it just delays the inevitable or leads to users never coming across the optional libs even when those libs would fit their use case.\r\n- An argument for delaying this is that invocations and patchwork are still rougher than the core libs, across a few axes (understanding which functions should live where, given #98; the general quality and test coverage is still lacking; etc).\r\n  - And funneling users at them only to generate more questions whose answers are \"sorry! still working on that\" doesn't feel good.\r\n  - But neither does hiding them, of course.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's enough overthinking a plate of beans. I guess in the end putting it \"out there\" and in the README is the best route. Anyone who was gonna be turned off by it is both A) likely to still be turned off by it even if they understand 2 of the libs are optional, and B) probably going to be a bit of a support vampire anyways 😐 .","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabric/fabric/issues/comments/407193463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1748759893,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3NDg3NTk4OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabric/fabric/issues/events/1748759893","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e8e99009872a1d0a8f25319244340c2e99173142","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabric/fabric/commits/e8e99009872a1d0a8f25319244340c2e99173142","created_at":"2018-07-23T21:25:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabric/fabric/issues/comments/407206309","html_url":"https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/1776#issuecomment-407206309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabric/fabric/issues/1776","id":407206309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzIwNjMwOQ==","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-23T21:25:48Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T21:25:48Z","body":"Put a note block in the README about this.
