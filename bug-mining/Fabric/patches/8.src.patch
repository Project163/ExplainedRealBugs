+- :bug:`1852` Grant internal `~fabric.connection.Connection` objects created
+  during ``ProxyJump`` based gateways/proxies a copy of the outer
+  ``Connection``'s configuration object. This was not previously done, which
+  among other things meant one could not fully disable SSH config file loading
+  (as the internal ``Connection`` objects would revert to the default
+  behavior). Thanks to Chris Adams for the report.
 - :release:`2.0.4 <2018-07-31>`
 - :bug:`-` Implement ``__lt__`` on `~fabric.connection.Connection` so it can be
   sorted; this was overlooked when implementing things like ``__eq__`` and
