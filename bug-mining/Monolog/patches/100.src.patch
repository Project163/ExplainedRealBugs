+### 2.0.0-beta1 (2018-12-08)
+
+  * BC Break: This is a major release, see [UPGRADE.md] for details if you are coming from a 1.x release
+  * BC Break: PHP 7.1 is now the minimum required PHP version.
+  * BC Break: Quite a few interface changes, only relevant if you implemented your own handlers/processors/formatters
+  * BC Break: Removed non-PSR-3 methods to add records, all the `add*` (e.g. `addWarning`) methods as well as `emerg`, `crit`, `err` and `warn`
+  * BC Break: The record timezone is now set per Logger instance and not statically anymore
+  * BC Break: There is no more default handler configured on empty Logger instances
+  * BC Break: Various handler-specific breaks, see [UPGRADE.md] for details
+  * Added scalar type hints and return hints in all the places it was possible. Switched strict_types on for more reliability.
+  * Added DateTimeImmutable support, all record datetime are now immutable, and will toString/json serialize with the correct date format, including microseconds (unless disabled)
+  * Added timezone and microseconds to the default date format
+  * Added SendGridHandler to use the SendGrid API to send emails
+  * Added LogmaticHandler to use the Logmatic.io API to store log records
+  * Added SqsHandler to send log records to an AWS SQS queue
+  * Added NoopHandler which is similar to the NullHandle but does not prevent the bubbling of log records to handlers further down the configuration, useful for temporarily disabling a handler in configuration files
+  * Added ProcessHandler to write log output to the STDIN of a given process
+  * Added HostnameProcessor that adds the machine's hostname to log records
+  * Added a `$dateFormat` option to the PsrLogMessageProcessor which lets you format DateTime instances nicely
+  * Added support for the PHP 7.x `mongodb` extension in the MongoDBHandler
+  * Fixed many minor issues in various handlers, and probably added a few regressions too
+
 ### 1.24.0 (2018-11-05)
 
   * BC Notice: If you are extending any of the Monolog's Formatters' `normalize` method, make sure you add the new `$depth = 0` argument to your function signature to avoid strict PHP warnings.

 ### 2.0.0
 
-- The timezone is now set per Logger instance and not statically, either
-  via ->setTimezone or passed in the constructor. Calls to Logger::setTimezone
-  should be converted.
+- `Monolog\Logger::API` can be used to distinguish between a Monolog `1` and `2`
+  install of Monolog when writing integration code.
 
 - Removed non-PSR-3 methods to add records, all the `add*` (e.g. `addWarning`)
   methods as well as `emerg`, `crit`, `err` and `warn`.
 
+- DateTime are not formatted with a timezone and microseconds (unless disabled).
+  Various formatters and log output might be affected, which may mess with log parsing
+  in some cases.
+
+- The `datetime` in every record array is now a DateTimeImmutable, not that you
+  should have been modifying these anyway.
+
+- The timezone is now set per Logger instance and not statically, either
+  via ->setTimezone or passed in the constructor. Calls to Logger::setTimezone
+  should be converted.
+
 - `HandlerInterface` has been split off and two new interfaces now exist for
   more granular controls: `ProcessableHandlerInterface` and
   `FormattableHandlerInterface`. Handlers not extending `AbstractHandler`
@@ -14,4 +24,36 @@
 
 - `HandlerInterface` now requires the `close` method to be implemented. This
   only impacts you if you implement the interface yourself, but you can extend
-  the new `Monolog\Handler\Handler` base class.
+  the new `Monolog\Handler\Handler` base class too.
+
+- There is no more default handler configured on empty Logger instances, if
+  you were relying on that you will not get any output anymore, make sure to
+  configure the handler you need.
+
+#### LogglyFormatter
+
+- The records' `datetime` is not sent anymore. Only `timestamp` is sent to Loggly.
+
+#### AmqpHandler
+
+- Log levels are not shortened to 4 characters anymore. e.g. a warning record
+  will be sent using the `warning.channel` routing key instead of `warn.channel`
+  as in 1.x.
+- The exchange name does not default to 'log' anymore, and it is completely ignored
+  now for the AMQP extension users. Only PHPAmqpLib uses it if provided.
+
+#### RotatingFileHandler
+
+- The file name format must now contain `{date}` and the date format must be set
+  to one of the predefined FILE_PER_* constants to avoid issues with file rotation.
+  See `setFilenameFormat`.
+
+#### LogstashFormatter
+
+- Removed Logstash V0 support
+- Context/extra prefix has been removed in favor of letting users configure the exact key being sent
+- Context/extra data are now sent as an object instead of single keys
+
+#### HipChatHandler
+
+- Removed HipChat API v1 support
