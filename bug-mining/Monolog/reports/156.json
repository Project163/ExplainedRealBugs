The problem arises because the `reset` method is called on every `RequestReceived`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/laravel/octane/blob/2.x/src/Listeners/FlushMonologState.php\r\n\r\nWhen a `RotatingFileHandler` instance is reset with `true === $this->mustRotate`, the `$this->url` and `$this->nextRotation` attributes are updated by calling `rotate`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/884aa47a055ea3e8e351ceaf4dfc67f52fff44c0/src/Monolog/Handler/RotatingFileHandler.php#L133-L135\r\n\r\nAs a result, the `write` method cannot write to the new stream because `$this->close()` is never reached. This occurs because `$this->nextRotation` is already updated during the call to `reset`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/884aa47a055ea3e8e351ceaf4dfc67f52fff44c0/src/Monolog/Handler/RotatingFileHandler.php#L113-L126","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1905/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
