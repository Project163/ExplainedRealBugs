Why:\n- Shopware administrators should have an easy option to review logs\n- Shopware administrators should be able to easily copy log entries to communicate them to\n  plugin authors.\n# What:\n- All **logging** functionality based on the `monolog.handler.rotating_file.plugin` service, including `corelogger` and `pluginlogger`, use a **structured JSON format** for output in their log files.\n- There are now multiple tabs in the Backend's log viewer:\n  ![shopware ___version___ ___version_text___ rev ___revision___ - backend c shopware ag -

Backend's log viewer can display both the new JSON format and the legacy line-based format.\n- Exceptions related to core and plugin log entries and their causes (previous exceptions) can be seen in a detail view: ![shopware ___version___ ___version_text___ rev ___revision___ - backend c shopware ag -

Backend API end point renamed: `/log/getLogs` -> `/log/getBackendLogs`\n- Backend API end point renamed: `/log/deleteLogs` -> `/log/deleteBackendLogs`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shopware5/shopware/issues/596/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shopware5/shopware/issues/596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
