And the reason why all Monolog internals does not use PSR-3 constants is simple: Monolog was written at least 2 years before PSR-3\n\nAh, that makes sense :)  Thanks for the help!\n\nWould it be possible to add a static \"helper\" method to Monolog that converts from PSR3 `LogLevel` to Monolog's `LogLevel`?  E.g. ES-PHP users configure with `LogLevel`, internally the library calls the helper shim to convert `LogLevel` to `Logger` and then instantiates the handler chain using the appropriate `Logger` values.\n\nEven though the handler instantiation isn't \"user land code\", it's still a public API which things like the ES library interact with.\n\nI can easily add a helper shim to ES-PHP, but if it was in Monolog that would be even better so that changes in Monolog don't break ES-PHP :)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/56372730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/56373510","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/421#issuecomment-56373510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/421","id":56373510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzczNTEw","user":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-22T13:38:29Z","updated_at":"2014-09-22T13:38:29Z","body":"Any breaking changes to the log level will happen in 2.0 (if there are changes at all, it will be to normalize on the PSR-3 levels I suppose).
