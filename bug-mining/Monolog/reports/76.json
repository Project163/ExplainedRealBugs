The RollbarNotifier then sets it at a default level of `error`. \n\nThis means no matter what level you log the exception at it will always show up as level `error` in rollbar.\n\nSymfony's own ExceptionListener logs exceptions as `critical` when they are not instances of `HttpExceptionInterface` or have a status code great than or equal to 500.\n\nA quick solution (I think) to this would be to add:\n\n```\n$payload['level'] = strtolower($record['level_name']);\n```\n\nprior to calling the `report_exception` method ([line 70](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/src/Monolog/Handler/RollbarHandler.php#L70))\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
