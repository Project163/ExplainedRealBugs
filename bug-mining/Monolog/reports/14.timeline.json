looks like Chrome (used with [FirePHP4Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/firephp4chrome/gpgbmonepdpnacijbbdijfbecmgoojma)) has the lowest limit for headers size [according to StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3326210/can-http-headers-be-too-big-for-browsers) of 256kb for all headers.\n\nThis can quickly be a problem when using `$firephp->trace()` where stacktrace dumps can get huge.\n\nThe obvious way to solve that, would be to detect the browser and truncate the size of headers, including a warning for developers at the end of logs.\n\nBut maybe it could be much cleaner to combine effort with https://github.com/aaronsaray/FirePHP4Chrome and @aaronsaray and introduce a new optional header sent from FirePHP4Chrome, which would trigger a limit on header size.\n\nWhat would seem the best approach ?\n\nAlso see, similar issue (and how they solved it):

using the newly released chromePHP class 3.0 which is adapted to work with Chrome 17, but I'm getting the ERR_RESPONSE_HEADERS_TOO_BIG error. In earlier versions there used to be a workaround for the 4kb cookie limit by writing to file instead of using cookies. Now ChromePhp is using header information instead of cookies, but there's no workaround for the header size limit, which is according to google 64kb... For most of our pages, there's no problem but sometimes we exceed the limit.\n\nIs there going to be a workaround for this problem?\n\nMany
