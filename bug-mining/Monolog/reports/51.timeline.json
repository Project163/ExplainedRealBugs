point, is that the current point, never _add_ any new field into the `$this->extraFields` as the only way to add them, would be to call the method `addExtraField`.\n\nI admit, it is possible to do so, using the API, but when using Cascade, as the only way to inject them, is for Cascade to incept  the named parameters of the constructor, this is the only point where you can add them (by passing the named `extraFields` parameter as I outlined in my config sample).\n\nAs you couldn't add several clauses of calling `addExtraField` in what will be a map (as several clauses would have the same method name as a key). \n\nTo my point of view, the existing code, do not deliver what we could expect from a Cascade usage point of view, and in general as use case where we could use the constructor to _add_ more server fields mapping.\n\nMy suggestion is either to reconsider it, or add a new method, that could expect a Map and add the tuples from it, into the `$this->extraFields`.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/145823815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nonnenmacher","id":440919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/440919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher","html_url":"https://github.com/nonnenmacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonnenmacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":435178055,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDM1MTc4MDU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/435178055","actor":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0a2e4237d35f2f32f83ada42d00fd9b4c5c390cc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/commits/0a2e4237d35f2f32f83ada42d00fd9b4c5c390cc","created_at":"2015-10-14T13:09:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":435181971,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQzNTE4MTk3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/435181971","actor":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"80c4bfb9fd7397e2c998ea246b27d39cc57d0438","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/commits/80c4bfb9fd7397e2c998ea246b27d39cc57d0438","created_at":"2015-10-14T13:12:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/148045417","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/663#issuecomment-148045417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/663","id":148045417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODA0NTQxNw==","user":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com
