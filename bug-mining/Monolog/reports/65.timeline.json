How about splitting the info into two fields \"type\" and \"data\" then? For example like this:\n\n```\n    if ($data instanceof \\JsonSerializable) {\n        return $this->normalize(\n            array(\n                'type' => get_class($data),\n                'data' => $data->jsonSerialize(),\n            )\n        );\n    }\n```\n\nThat would give output like\n\n```\n[2015-07-13 10:06:25] log.INFO: mapped {\"bar\":{\"type\":\"Example\", \"data\":{\"data\":\"structure\"}}} []\n[2015-07-13 10:06:25] log.INFO: array [{\"type\":\"Example\", \"data\":{\"data\":\"structure\"}}] []\n```\n\nThe main advantage is that the class controls what is logged and that it uses JSON all the way through. BTW: I'd like to have something similar for exceptions, too, where I sometimes have additional info that should be logged but which is neither inside the \"regular\" fields nor inside the message.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean with the advise to \"consume it in a better format\", can you give an example? I personally don't have any problems with the JSON context data (though maybe it's just my bioware that is adjusted to this).\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/120846175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"UlrichEckhardt","id":8566055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NjYwNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8566055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/UlrichEckhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UlrichEckhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":574825894,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDU3NDgyNTg5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/574825894","actor":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-03-02T15:34:42Z","milestone":{"title":"2.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/191289602","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/560#issuecomment-191289602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/560","id":191289602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTI4OTYwMg==","user":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-02T15:35:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-02T15:35:00Z","body":"Reopening
