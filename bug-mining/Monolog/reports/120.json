version 2\r\n\r\nI use the swift mail handler in my Laravel app and I started to notice recently that monolog handler was raising an error within itself when trying to pipe out to emails, like so:\r\n```text\r\nPHP message: PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught TypeError: Argument 1 passed to Monolog\\Handler\\SwiftMailerHandler::getSubjectFormatter() must be of the type string, null given, called in /var/www/html/vendor/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/Handler/SwiftMailerHandler.php on line 84 and defined in /var/www/html/vendor/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/Handler/SwiftMailerHandler.php:57\r\nStack trace:\r\n#0 /var/www/html/vendor/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/Handler/SwiftMailerHandler.php(84): Monolog\\Handler\\SwiftMailerHandler->getSubjectFormatter(NULL)\r\n#1 /var/www/html/vendor/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/Handler/SwiftMailerHandler.php(49): Monolog\\Handler\\SwiftMailerHandler->buildMessage('<h1 style=\"back...', Array)\r\n#2

/var/www/html/vendor/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/Handler/AbstractProcessingHandler.php(42): Monolog\\Handl\r\n```\r\nI have been doing some extra investigation into this, finding that something has changed in recent versions of monolog which means that now I must explicitly put the subject into the message that I send into the handler.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit annoying since I want a subject based on the error contents, is this intentional and if not is there a way to replicate this functionality in newer versions?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
