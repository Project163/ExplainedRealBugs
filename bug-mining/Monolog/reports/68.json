I'm often injecting loggers as dependencies into objects, and then may cache those objects. Upon retrieving the objects from cache, the logger is typically broken because its resources of course fail serialization/unserialization (e.g. the default `StreamHandler`).\n\nThe fix is easy, in the case of `StreamHandler` this is all that's needed:\n\n```\npublic function __wakeup() {\n    $this->close();\n}\n```\n\nRather hacky, but that's all that's required; the rest of the class is already behaving as needed.\n\nPlease consider adding proper `__sleep`/`__wakeup` compatibility to all handlers by default.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
