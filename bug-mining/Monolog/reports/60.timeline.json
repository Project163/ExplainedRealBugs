, @GrahamCampbell :\n\nUp until recently, my L-5.1 based app was successfully logging all and every exception that was thrown via unit-tests' exception scenarios. But after I upgraded to L-5.2, all those exceptions stopped being logged in external log-writers (i.e. Monolog handlers, such as Hipchat, Gitter etc). They still are being recorded in laravel.log file of course.\n\nI debugged the case, and ended up in:\nhttps://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.2/src/Illuminate/Events/Dispatcher.php#L220\n\nwhere latest L-5.2 doesn't fetch any listeners for logging. My question is: were any loggers removed from Laravel as of late, as a result of which my custom log-handlers stopped logging any errors, but direct errors in app?

Otherwise, you are using streams, not cUrl - how else will you be able to read the response of endpoint through stream resource?\n\nAddendum: btw, this was working for me until recently, until coupla months ago.
