solution</li>\n<li>Added <code>$ignoreEmptyContextAndExtra</code> option to JsonFormatter to skip empty context/extra entirely from the output</li>\n<li>Added <code>$parseMode</code>, <code>$disableWebPagePreview</code> and <code>$disableNotification</code> options to TelegramBotHandler</li>\n<li>Added tentative support for PHP 8</li>\n<li>NormalizerFormatter::addJsonEncodeOption

FilterHandler triggering a notice when handleBatch was filtering all records passed to it</li>\n<li>Fixed Turkish locale messing up the conversion of level names to their constant values</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.0.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed normalization of Traversables to avoid traversing them as not all of them are rewindable</li>\n<li>Fixed setFormatter/getFormatter to forward to the nested handler in FilterHandler, FingersCrossedHandler, BufferHandler, OverflowHandler and SamplingHandler</li>\n<li>Fixed BrowserConsoleHandler formatting when using multiple styles</li>\n<li>Fixed normalization of exception codes to be always integers even for PDOException which have them as numeric strings</li>\n<li>Fixed normalization of SoapFault objects containing non-strings as &quot;detail&quot;</li>\n<li>Fixed json encoding across all handlers to always attempt recovery of non-UTF-8 strings instead of failing the whole encoding</li>\n<li>Fixed ChromePHPHandler to avoid sending more data than latest Chrome versions allow in headers (4KB down from 256KB).</li>\n<li>Fixed type error in BrowserConsoleHandler when the context array of log records was not associative.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.0.0</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Calls to Logger::setTimezone\nshould be converted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>HandlerInterface</code> has been split off and two new interfaces now exist for\nmore granular controls: <code>ProcessableHandlerInterface</code> and\n<code>FormattableHandlerInterface</code>. Handlers not extending <code>AbstractHandler</code>\nshould make sure to implement the relevant interfaces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>HandlerInterface</code> now requires the <code>close</code> method to be implemented. This\nonly impacts you if you implement the interface yourself, but you can extend\nthe new <code>Monolog\\Handler\\Handler</code> base class too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is no more default handler configured on empty Logger instances, if\nyou were relying on that you will not get any output anymore, make sure to\nconfigure the handler you need.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>LogglyFormatter</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The records' <code>datetime</code> is not sent anymore. Only <code>timestamp</code> is sent to Loggly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>AmqpHandler</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Log levels are not shortened to 4 characters anymore. e.g. a warning record\nwill be sent using the <code>warning.channel</code> routing key instead of <code>warn.channel</code>\nas in 1.x.</li>\n<li>The exchange name does not default to 'log' anymore, and it is completely ignored\nnow for the AMQP extension users. Only PHPAmqpLib uses it if provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>RotatingFileHandler</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The file name format must now contain <code>{date}</code> and the date format must be set\nto one of the predefined FILE_PER_* constants to avoid issues with file rotation.\nSee <code>setFilenameFormat</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
