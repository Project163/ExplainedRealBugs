@Seldaek I disagree with the addition of the explicit call to the `exit` function.  Uncaught exceptions lead to poor UX so when I write any applications, I make sure to catch any possible exceptions and log them with stack trace.  This `handleException` does exactly that but with the call to `exit` function, it still breaks my application.  Why would you still break your application(s) when you are able to handle the exceptions/errors?\r\nI'm using the `RavenHandler` to send stack trace to Sentry but with this explicit exit call, I'm forced to use the native `Raven_Client` and its own `handleException` function, which does NOT call `exit`.  I like monolog for its flexibility of having all sorts of logger support but this is counter productive/intuitive for me and others to have to write extra code to do what needed to be done.\r\nPlease reconsider.

out there who's using this function either doesn't care if their application breaks since it already breaks and relies on that or does what I do - workaround.\r\n\r\nHowever, IMHO the purpose of this function is to handle uncaught exceptions.  Since it successfully handles them, why should it behave the same way exceptions do?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I have my workaround and moved on but just thought I should drop by and express my opinion on this.\r\n\r\nThanks.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/452876459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jian-wu","id":1561024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjEwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1561024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu","html_url":"https://github.com/jian-wu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian-wu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/453053128","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/592#issuecomment-453053128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/592","id":453053128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzA1MzEyOA==","user":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-10T10:49:49Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T10:49:49Z","body":"The point is to log the exceptions, not suppress them.
