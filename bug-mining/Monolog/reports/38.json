The reason is that `json_encode` can't encode those values, and that is being used in the LineFormatter.\n\n```\n$record = array(\n    'message' => 'Watch it',\n    'context' => [\n        'a' => 10,\n        'b' => INF,\n        'c' => [\n            'd' => NAN,\n            'e' => null,\n            'f' => -INF\n        ]\n    ],\n    'level' => 100,\n    'level_name' => 'DEBUG',\n    'channel' => 'test',\n    'datetime' => new DateTime(),\n    'extra' => array(),\n);\n\n$formatter = new \\Monolog\\Formatter\\LineFormatter();\necho $formatter->format($record);\n```\n\nGives the output\n\n```\n[2015-03-04 11:08:07] test.DEBUG: Watch it []\n```\n\nThis  can be fixed by taking these values into account while normalizing, for example in the `Monolog\\Formatter\\NormalizeFormatter`.\n\n```\n    protected function normalize($data)\n    {\n        if (null === $data || is_scalar($data)) {\n//++++++\n            if (is_float($data)) {\n                if (is_infinite($data)) {\n                    return '[' .

I spent quite some time debugging something involving INF, and I would have noticed the issue much quicker if I would've been able to see the logging context properly.\n\nThanks.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/523/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
