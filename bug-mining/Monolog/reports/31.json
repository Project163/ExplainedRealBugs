I'm in a situation where I would like to clear/empty the buffer of my handler (finger_crossed) at certain point.\n\nI've a script under Supervisor's control that process N item for each run. I've setup monolog to send me a mail each time an `error` is logged. Everything works, the problem is that the mail contains too many message. Messages that are not \"related\" to the scope/cycle that gave the problem. And this makes the log harder to understand.\n\nI know I can decrease the size of the buffer. But tuning it to get the right size is not easy. I think that would be nice to have the possibilities to reset the buffer in a specific point (at the beginning of the loop in my situation) so the user get just the messages that matter to him.\n\nI would like to add a method like `emptyBuffer` in `FingersCrossedHandler` class that empty `buffer` property. \n\nDo you think this make sense ? Would you consider a PR ? Is there another smarter way to solve this issue ?\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
