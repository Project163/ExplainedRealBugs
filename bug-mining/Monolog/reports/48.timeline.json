change rips the guts out of our custom logging and instead relies much more on Monolog.\n\nA few notes:\n- The coupling to Monolog is small, but non-zero. Most of the work is done by the Injector system, but the `MonologLoader` class has some plumbing in it to make it a bit less verbose to set up handlers. Arguably, this could be done by adding features to the Injector, but I chose not to dig too far into this.\n- It's still fairly verbose to configure common log options like log-to-file. If we wanted, we could add more support to MonologLoader to read more concise config values and configure the appropriate handlers.\n- Disabling display_errors in main.php is a bit weird but necessary to make this work. Of note: ErrorControlChain makes it impossible to do this within the regular set-up code.\n- The two handlers I have, for displaying detailed and friendly errors, might instead be better as formatters. We may also wish to consider whether it's best not to maintain our own implementations of those, although the default ones provided by Monolog are a bit dry.\n- If we replaced those with formatters, we'd need to think about what kinds of handlers would be best. We could just use:\n  - A StreamHandler, pointing to STDOUT\n  - A new handler that calls `echo` and `header()` as appropriate\n  - A new handler that makes use of `SS_HTTPResponse` (to be useful, this would need to tied into Director somehow\n- In future, it would be good to pass the logger in as an instance variable, rather than relying on calls to `Injector::inst()->get('Logger')`.\n\nIt's satisfying to pull out so much unnecessary code!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/4430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/4430/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/127830167","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/622#issuecomment-127830167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/622","id":127830167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzgzMDE2Nw==","user":{"login":"camspiers","id":51294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers","html_url":"https://github.com/camspiers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspiers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-05T03:12:55Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T03:12:55Z","body":"I'm
