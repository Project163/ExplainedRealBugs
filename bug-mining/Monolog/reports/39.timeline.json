did you mind reading my comments at all?\nI really don't think that supporting v2 makes sense at all.\nv2 requires a personal oauth token, bound to an user, NOT one of the old api keys.\nv2 WON'T work with them. \nAnd, if you create your personal oauth token, all log messages will be sent with your name!\nWe used the nickname to distinguish the servers which sent the messages, but the nickname feature has been removed from v2.\nAnd it won't come back.\nNow you could create a user for every server, but who wants to create and maintain a few dozen users, that also appear in hipchat?\nAtlassians solution for this are the integrations, but these also don't really work with monolog.\nYou can register an integration, which will provide you with a user id and a secret, with which you can create an integration-oauth-token, which will only be valid vor 3600 seconds.\nSo, monolog would have to track these tokens, OR create a new oauth-token for each request.\nAnd it still doesn't solve the nickname issue, since messages would now be sent with the integration name.\nI would suggest sticking with the v1 api for monolog - i don't think that atlassian will shut down the v1 api. In jira the v1 apis are still available after months or even years.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/78142117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"temp","id":216128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp","html_url":"https://github.com/temp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/78144383","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/525#issuecomment-78144383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/525","id":78144383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTQ0Mzgz","user":{"login":"esalter","id":2206258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDYyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2206258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter","html_url":"https://github.com/esalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esalter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-10T20:46:05Z","updated_at":"2015-03-10T20:46:05Z","body":"It depends on your use case.
