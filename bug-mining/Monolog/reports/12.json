Something along the lines of:\n\n```\nuse Monolog\\Logger;\nuse Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler;\n\n$stack = [\n    new LogMiddleware(new Logger('app', [new StreamHandler('app.log')])),\n    new CacheMiddleware(__DIR__.'/cache'),\n];\n```\n\nWith the PSR LoggerInterface this will become increasingly common, as such it would be nice to not have to create a separate variable and call `pushHandler` for simple use cases.\n\nI figured it might be controversial, so I opened a ticket before investing in a PR.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
