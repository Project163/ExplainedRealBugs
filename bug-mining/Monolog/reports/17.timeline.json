can confirm that the switch to glob() has resolved the issue. Thanks for patching it and making the PHP bug report.\n\nThe test script you posted on the PHP bug report works fine for me. I never see any exceptions using either Apache/Mod PHP or CLI. I can only get this error to occur in the Monolog context I detailed earlier. I have error_reporting set to -1, display_errors set to 1, and I'm using PHP 5.4.14 on OSX Lion.\n\nEdit: Okay, I can reproduce this. It looks like it only happens when the GlobIterator is used inside a destructor:\n\n``` php\n<?php\nerror_reporting(-1);\nini_set('display_errors', 1);\nini_set('open_basedir', __DIR__);\n\nclass Globber\n{\n    public function __destruct()\n    {\n        var_dump(__DIR__);\n        var_dump(glob(__DIR__ . '/*.php'));\n        var_dump(iterator_to_array(new \\GlobIterator(__DIR__ . '/*.php')));\n    }\n}\n\n$globber = new Globber;\n?>\n```\n\nIf I run this via the CLI it works just fine, but when I use Apache/Mod PHP it throws the UnexpectedValueException exception.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/19761753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ziadoz","id":645637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTYzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/645637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz","html_url":"https://github.com/ziadoz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziadoz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":83707240,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDgzNzA3MjQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/83707240","actor":{"login":"mathroc","id":291531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTUzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc","html_url":"https://github.com/mathroc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathroc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9795b2fd43719c0e5010b5ee6fa47dcd01bb5c5a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mathroc/monolog/commits/9795b2fd43719c0e5010b5ee6fa47dcd01bb5c5a","created_at":"2013-12-30T20:04:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Defcon0","id":1485098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODUwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1485098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0","html_url":"https://github.com/Defcon0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Defcon0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-14T13:45:03Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T13:45:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1784","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1784/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1784/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1784/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1784","id":1496663226,"node_id":"I_kwDOABUBmM5ZNUS6","number":1784,"title":"glob()
