I've overrided `LineFormatter::format()` in my formatter to have comma-separated values instead of json in context field:\n\n```\n// simplified example\npublic function format(array $record) {\n    $record['context'] = join(',', $values);\n    return parent::format($record);\n}\n```\n\nIn previous version it worked well because every `$record` item except `extra` was directly passed into `stringify` method: https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/481fc4cfa17808581d113673e7dd002b06dcc100/src/Monolog/Formatter/LineFormatter.php#L93\n\nI assume that it should be done with processor. I'll restrict version to previous one until my refactoring. But you may take into consideration that your fix breaks compatibility in some way :)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/191723134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nitso","id":443011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/443011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso","html_url":"https://github.com/nitso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
