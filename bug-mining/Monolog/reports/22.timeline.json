I know about Twig, I'm triying to use it but i don't like the syntax and need to rewrite my \"plugins\" again :( \n\nAbout the post topic, my last contribution break the headers and nothing except tables appear on the logs, due to the Firephp core code.... so I manage to read the FirePHP Wildfire Wiki and ended with this on the \"format\" method of WildfireFormatter.php \n\n```\n        if(isset($record['context']['table'])){\n            $type  = 'TABLE';\n            $label = $record['message'];\n            $message = $record['context']['table'];\n        }\n        else {\n            $type  = $this->logLevels[$record['level']];\n            $label = $record['channel'];\n        }\n\n        // Create JSON object describing the appearance of the message in the console\n        $json = $this->toJson(array(\n            array(\n                'Type'  => $type,\n                'File'  => $file,\n                'Line'  => $line,\n                'Label' => $label,\n            ),\n            $message\n        ), $handleError);\n\n```\n\nas always, using it this way, so I can render tables at any level\n`$log->debug(\"Benchmark\", array('table'=>array(....)));`\n\nThe table array must be non-associative.\n\nThis code is better since it lives in the formatter and does not use the FirePHP library in any way (there was no need to use it anyway thanks to your great work)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/12460948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Surt","id":48085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt","html_url":"https://github.com/Surt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":106052557,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwNjA1MjU1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/106052557","actor":{"login":"snapshotpl","id":312655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl","html_url":"https://github.com/snapshotpl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"399d10bcf09272dce649e09c2c5e0e5f36d03bb4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/snapshotpl/monolog/commits/399d10bcf09272dce649e09c2c5e0e5f36d03bb4","created_at":"2014-03-27T13:38:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":108754651,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwODc1NDY1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/108754651","actor":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"677ad16d6e23fec412ead15b2d3657ffe99ea5a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/commits/677ad16d6e23fec412ead15b2d3657ffe99ea5a0","created_at":"2014-04-04T15:13:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
