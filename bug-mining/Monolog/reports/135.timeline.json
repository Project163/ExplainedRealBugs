of the current processors caused one of our CI steps to fail like this during the build:\r\n\r\n```In RedactEmailProcessor.php line 26:\r\n  [TypeError]

didn't really try reproducing that locally (too much hassle), but my first instinct is to blame current code of the Processor in question, which first converts the whole array into a JSON string, then performs a `preg_replace_callback` on that string, and then attempts to convert the string back to an array, and doesn't even check the result. Thus I decided to refactor these processors to employ a cycle and a recursion instead. While doing this, I also noticed that the code of both of the processors is basically the same, with the exception of the regex that is used. So I figured why not move everything into the abstract class and just have a single constant in both final processors. WDYT?\r\n\r\nBTW, I also have a separate branch where I'm working on Monolog 3 support, but Seldaek/monolog#1680 is currently blocking me. :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/egeniq/monolog-gdpr/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/egeniq/monolog-gdpr/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/1150353546","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1680#issuecomment-1150353546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1680","id":1150353546,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUBmM5EkQCK","user":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-08T20:07:17Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T20:07:17Z","body":"The ResettableInterface problem is no problem at all as you can already add the void type in 2.x.\r\n\r\nThe ProcessorInterface is indeed a tricky one.. As the 2.x one had `__invoke(array $record)` we are left with these options for 3.x:\r\n\r\n- `__invoke($record)` which should allow it to work everywhere but types nothing, and doens't allow people to use a LogRecord type at all on the parameter, and lacks return type altho implementors can add one\r\n- `__invoke(array|LogRecord $record)` which requires php8 but should allow it to work everywhere and offers a bit more type safety but it is kinda meaningless in the monolog3 context, and lacks return type altho implementors can add one\r\n- `__invoke(LogRecord $record): LogRecord` is indeed incompatible but at least allows correct types if you fully embrace 3.x\r\n\r\nThe problem is now I can't even change it without breaking things further in 3.x, so yes it sucks a bit but I don't think it should change as the current way is better long term.\r\n\r\nFor the short term there are two workarounds:\r\n\r\n- Conditionally declare a base class or trait depending on the Monolog version like I did in symfony-bridge to support both versions: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.2/src/Symfony/Bridge/Monolog/Processor/CompatibilityProcessor.php\r\n- Skip ProcessorInterface entirely, and just implement __invoke as you please. Monolog just requires processors to be callables and does not actually care about the ProcessorInterface, so if you don't need it for autowiring things in a Symfony context for example I think this is the better way.\r\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/1150353546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6772779094,"node_id":"LE_lADOABUBmM5KrwS4zwAAAAGTsGhW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/6772779094","actor":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-08T20:07:24Z","label":{"name":"Support","color":"f9d0c4"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6772779358,"node_id":"MIE_lADOABUBmM5KrwS4zwAAAAGTsGle","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/6772779358","actor":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-08T20:07:28Z","milestone":{"title":"3.x"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/1150672683","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1680#issuecomment-1150672683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1680","id":1150672683,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUBmM5Eld8r","user":{"login":"rimas-kudelis","id":2812673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2812673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis","html_url":"https://github.com/rimas-kudelis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rimas-kudelis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T05:02:04Z","updated_at":"2
