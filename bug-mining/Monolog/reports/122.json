I'm *assuming* that is the intention, though it is not explicly documented.\r\n\r\nHowever, the parameter provided has this effect instead:\r\n\r\n* `true` - set JSON \"pretty print\" on.\r\n* `false` - toggle JSON \"pretty print\" on or off.\r\n\r\nI believe the fix should be:\r\n\r\n    $this->jsonEncodeOptions &= ~JSON_PRETTY_PRINT;\r\n\r\nI need to test that that further, in case the number of bits set for the inverse of `JSON_PRETTY_PRINT` is not enough for the datatype of `$this->jsonEncodeOptions`, requiring perhaps some longint casting (just a hunch, but I really haven't dug into it that deeply yet), but it works for me as a quick test.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround at present:-\r\n\r\nTo enable JSON pretty print:\r\n\r\n    $formatter->setJsonPrettyPrint(true);\r\n\r\nTo disable JSON pretty print:\r\n\r\n    $formatter->setJsonPrettyPrint(true);\r\n    $formatter->setJsonPrettyPrint(false);\r\n\r\ni.e. toggle from a known state.\r\n\r\nHappy to provide a PR if you aggree with this, including some documentation clarifications. I guess it is not urgent, having been around for a long time, and there is a workaround ([which I am using here](https://github.com/consilience/laravel-extended-logging/blob/master/src/Tap.php#L47)) that will also be forward-compatible with this fix.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
