Importantly, the logging level is being set with the LogLevel PSR3 class:\n\n``` php\n$logLevel = Log\\LogLevel::WARNING;  // <== using LogLevel:: instead of Logger::\n\n$log       = new Logger('log');\n$handler   = new StreamHandler(\n    $logPath,\n    $logLevel,\n   ...\n);\n$processor = new IntrospectionProcessor();\n\n$log->pushHandler($handler);\n$log->pushProcessor($processor);\n\n...\n```\n\nThis proves problematic, since it seems Monolog is using it's own `Logger` class for log level enum instead of `LogLevel`?  \n\nIs there a better way to configure Monolog in a way that still allows interoperability with other loggers?  I'm happy to convert the `LogLevel` enum into the `Logger` enum if there isn't another way, but wanted to make sure I wasn't doing something silly :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/421/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
