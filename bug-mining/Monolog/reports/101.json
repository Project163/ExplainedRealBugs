server ran out of diskspace after a cronjob kept writing to a log file in an infinite loop caused by the DeduplicationHandler.\r\n\r\nThe infinite loop happens here:\r\nhttps://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/bfc9ebb28f97e7a24c45bdc3f0ff482e47bb0266/src/Monolog/Handler/DeduplicationHandler.php#L146-L151\r\n\r\nAnd the output is these two lines infinitely:\r\n```\r\nPHP Warning:  feof() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in .../vendor/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/Handler/DeduplicationHandler.php on line 146\r\nPHP Warning:  fgets() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in .../vendor/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/Handler/DeduplicationHandler.php on line 147\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn further inspection I found out the cause to be insufficient file permissions, there was also a warning:\r\n```\r\nPHP Warning:  fopen(...): failed to open stream: Permission denied in .../vendor/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/Handler/DeduplicationHandler.php on line 140\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut anyway, should probably check that `$handle` is not `false` before going into the while loop.","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1286/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
