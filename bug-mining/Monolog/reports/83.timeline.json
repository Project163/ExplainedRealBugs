am using Monolog version 2\r\n\r\nFirst of all thanks for the brilliance that FingersCrossedHandler is in keeping a relevant logging stream.\r\n\r\nWe've configured FingersCrossedhandler with an activation lavel of `warning` and a passthru level of `notice` to allow `notice`-level logs to go through but skip `info`-level one unless we have a warning. This generally works fins but in cases where the nested handler needs flushing and registers a call to `close()` at shutdown there is an ordering issue if the Nested Handlers `close()` is called before `FingersCrossed::close()` and we have `notice` records but haven't reached the activation level.\r\n\r\nIf FingersCrossedHandler have  buffered records it writes those to the nested handler on it's close but if the nested handler have already flushed it's records before that they are never sent as it's close method is not called again.\r\n\r\nChecking #864 I see you don't like calling the close manually on the nested handlers and I can see that being a problem if close is not guaranteed to be callable more than once and it's even somewhat reasonable for a handler to not accept records after it's been called but this leaves an unintuitive hole to lose log records depending on registration order of shutdown functions.\r\n\r\nWe can solve it in our case by manually noticing this and flushing the affected handler but it's not really ideal and took a while to debug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1381/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12274128857,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABUBmM4KzACpzwAAAALbmFfZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/12274128857","actor":{"login":"xabbuh","id":1957048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTcwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1957048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh","html_url":"https://github.com/xabbuh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"371b8ebb1bdfe5f254024fed671959f6c452aff7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xabbuh/monolog/commits/371b8ebb1bdfe5f254024fed671959f6c452aff7","created_at":"2024-03-27T23:12:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
