[source](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/src/Monolog/Formatter/NormalizerFormatter.php#L21)\nThis formats lacks informations such as current timezone and is not really a standard format.\n\nWould it be a problem to replace this default format by at least something which does not lack information such as [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) or [ISO 8601](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) date formats ?\n\nSince PHP seems to provide constants such as DateTime::ISO8601 or DateTime::RFC3339 that should not require a lot of work.\n\nIf ever I overlooked anything about datetime support in Monolog feel free to tell me :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/196/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
