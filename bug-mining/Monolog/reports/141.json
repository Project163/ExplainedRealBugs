But I noticed that some objects in the log context are not normalized like it is via the `NormalizerFormatter` and therefore disappear when using the `JsonFormatter`.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I am refering to the Symfony `AuthenticatorManager` that is writing a \"Authenticator successful\" log message after a successful authentication:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/25c2bb1c7c2f1d1f32955c5f0365ccbfcc447137/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Authentication/AuthenticatorManager.php#L204\r\n\r\nYou can see there as well that the token is added to the log context (in my example it is an instance of `UsernamePasswordToken`).\r\n\r\nOn successful authentication and when using the `StreamHandler` with the default `NormalizerFormatter`, the output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2022-07-09T17:31:16.113589+02:00] security.INFO: Authenticator successful! {\"token\":{\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Authentication\\\\Token\\\\UsernamePasswordToken\":\"UsernamePasswordToken(user=\\\"foo@bar.com\\\", roles=\\\"ROLE_USER\\\")\"},\"authenticator\":\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Http\\\\Authenticator\\\\FormLoginAuthenticator\"} {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when the `JsonFormatter` is used, it looks like this:\r\n```\r\n{\"message\":\"Authenticator successful!\",\"context\":{\"token\":{},\"authenticator\":\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Http\\\\Authenticator\\\\FormLoginAuthenticator\"},\"level\":200,\"level_name\":\"INFO\",\"channel\":\"security\",\"datetime\":\"2022-07-09T17:31:16.113589+02:00\",\"extra\":{}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the token disappeared. I already did a bit of investigation and noticed that in the `NormalizerFormatter::normalize()` method contains some logic for objects:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/100d0f1625988be5cc8595aaf7429d0d9e96b9b8/src/Monolog/Formatter/NormalizerFormatter.php#L189-L207\r\n\r\nThe `JsonFormatter::normalize()` doesn't contain such logic.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that objects are not serialized, because json_encode is taking care of it. However, private fields in PHP are not part of the encoded JSON and therefore the information gets lost.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion for a fix would be to add a similar logic for the JSON normalizer if the objects implements `JSONSerializable` or has a `__toString()` method. What do you think about it? I can provide a PR if this proposal sounds reasonable to you.","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
