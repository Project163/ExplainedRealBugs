With fibers, the function might be entered multiple times in different fibers if one of them suspends somewhere within the function.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts to moving cycle detection to an interface? There could be a `NullCycleDetector` that doesn't detect cycles at all, a `CountingCycleDetector` and then a [`FiberLocal`](https://github.com/revoltphp/event-loop/blob/4e7455506d9ff61f3705b76a20a8f12ad4dc1552/src/EventLoop/FiberLocal.php) based implementation that keeps track of the depth for each fiber separately. I'm of course also fine with fibers being supported natively, but I don't think it's a good idea to put this logic into `Logger` itself in that case.","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
