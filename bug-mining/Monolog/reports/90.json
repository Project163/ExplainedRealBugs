This might otherwise work, but, the problem is Throwable. So, in this case, I wanted to override TypeError and make it critical. The array_replace adds the TypeError to the end of the list. The problem with that is Throwable matches TypeError or any other error type as far as I can tell. So, it never gets to the override since it's after Throwable in the array. Therefore, registerExceptionHandler is of no use as is.
