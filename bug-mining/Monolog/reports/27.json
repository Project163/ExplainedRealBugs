Because the error handler need a new Logger. So I have to instantiate the `BufferHandler` first. And so the `register_shutdown_function` is on top of the stack. Then I can instantiate the `ErrorHandler`. So the `ErrorHandler`'s `register_shutdown_function` is the the second one.\n\nAs the `ErrorHandler` collect errors and then \"push\" data to the buffer handler, when the `BufferHandler` is flushed, the buffer is empty.\n\nIf it's not clear, I can describe the issue on Gtalk / IRC.\n\nI have few idea to fix that\n- create a proxy in a SF2 application\n- or add a setter on the ErrorHandler and allow null value for the logger\n\nI prefer the second solution.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
