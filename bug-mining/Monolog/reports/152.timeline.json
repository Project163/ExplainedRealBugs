was able to replicate this UserFrosting by removing write permission to the log file, which resulted in a similar error message : \r\n\r\n```\r\nFatal error: Uncaught Error: Invalid callback Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler::customErrorHandler, cannot access private method Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler::customErrorHandler()\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the example above (https://3v4l.org/ZHA87) on the same environment and on the same file (without write access) returned the proper output : \r\n\r\n```\r\nstring(40) \"Failed to open stream: Permission denied\" string(9) \"Test test\" \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference is our app use a custom StreamWrapper. So the core PHP `fopen` isn't actually called by Monolog's StreamHandler, but our own. And **both** will invoke `customErrorHandler`, which won't work on our side since the method is private. Therefore, `customErrorHandler` must be **public**.\r\n\r\nNote the actual process when `customErrorHandler` is public is similar to this : \r\n1. Monolog StreamHandler call `fopen`\r\n2. Our own StreamHandler calls `fopen`\r\n3. `fopen` trows an exception\r\n4. Our StreamHandler invoke `customErrorHandler` (even if we use `@fopen`), then do the rest of it's job and return `false`.\r\n5.
