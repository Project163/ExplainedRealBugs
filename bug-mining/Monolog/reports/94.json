In case of GelfHandler, it unsets the publisher, leaving itself in a broken state.\r\n\r\nIf then some other code tries to log something, be it from a destructor that is randomly executed at a later time, or, in case of handleFatalError(), in another shutdown function, instead of gracefully refusing to log anything, the GelfHandler causes (_another_) fatal.\r\n\r\nI agree that logging from shutdown functions or constructors may not be a good idea. However, I don't think the handler should cause a fatal error in these cases. For example, StreamHandler even re-opens the stream automatically in write() if it's been closed before. (I don't know whether that's a good _idea_, but that's what happens.)\r\n\r\nHere is a short test script to show what I'm talking about:\r\n\r\n    <?php\r\n    require 'vendor/autoload.php';\r\n    $handler = new Monolog\\Handler\\GelfHandler(\r\n        new Gelf\\Publisher(new Gelf\\Transport\\UdpTransport())\r\n    );\r\n    $logger = new Monolog\\Logger(null, [$handler]);\r\n    Monolog\\ErrorHandler::register($logger);\r\n    register_shutdown_function(function() use ($logger) {\r\n        $logger->debug('Something that shouldn\\'t crash the application');\r\n    });\r\n    trigger_error('Something fatal', E_USER_ERROR);\r\n\r\nExecuting this will raise _two_ fatal errors, first \"something fatal,\" and then \"Call to a member function publish() on null.\" For comparison, if you don't pass the handler to the Logger constructor, effectively creating a StreamHandler, only one fatal occurs (and afterwards the debug message is logged).\r\n\r\nThis can't be intended behavior...? Ideally, in my mind, every handler should act the same way and throw a specific exception if write() is called while it is closed. This exception could easily be caught and handled correctly. However, since for example the stream handler just gracefully re-opens its stream in that case, implementing this exception could be considered a BC break.","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
