version 2\r\n\r\nThank you for this great logging tool!\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask,\r\n\r\nWhy is includeStacktraces an option that cannot be set in constructor in LineFormatter and JsonFormatter?\r\n\r\nbecause we have to call `includeStacktraces()` to enable stacktrace, we need to create an custom formatter just to enable stacktrace in some frameworks.\r\n\r\nex.\r\n\r\n* using JsonFormatter with Laravel\r\n  * Laravel default Lineformatter enables stacktrace like this, but no way to enable it in JsonFormatter by config.\r\n  *

handles it it monolog-bundle and can configure it in config files.\r\n  * https://github.com/symfony/monolog-bundle/blob/92bd02cc10c40605ff5b4cea88a2911e421aed6b/MonologBundle.php#L43-L52\r\n\r\nIf includeStacktraces could be set in constructor, we don't need to create a custom formatter class for these usages and configure it in framework config files.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
