It seems to be a case described in documentation:\nhttps://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/doc/01-usage.md#leveraging-channels\n\nThe problem is in order to avoid sharing handlers and processors in Dependency Injection Container I had to write ugly piece of code as below:. The main point here is to keep the same UID processor instance for both loggers:\n\n``` php\n    $logger = new \\Monolog\\Logger('elasticsearch');\n    // reuse UID processor and handlers\n    $logger->setHandlers($c['logger']->getHandlers());\n    foreach ($c['logger']->getProcessors() as $proc) {\n        $logger->pushProcessor($proc);\n    }\n```\n\nEasier (and more performant) would be to just clone the logger object and change it's channel name, like:\n\n``` php\n$logger2 = clone $logger;\n$logger2->setName('elasticsearch');\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/730/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
