The issue is you \n1. cannot change the name on a logger\n2. cannot get all the handlers currently associated with the logger (without popping them all off one by one and causing side effects)\n\nThe only way around this is evil code that pops everything off and stores it, and pops everything on, or stores handlers in another location in the app every time (which in large apps is obnoxious, especially when your handler sets can be quite disparate or controlled entirely by environment) \n\nCan we possibly get a \"getHandlers()\" method that just returns the contents of the protected $handlers array?  corollary, getProcessors() would be great as well\n\n$copied_logger = new Logger('newname', $old->getHandlers(), $old->getProcessors()); \n\nwould make my life 200% better ;)\n","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/363/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
