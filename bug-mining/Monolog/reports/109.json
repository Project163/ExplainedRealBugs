My current use case: Using the [Monolog](https://www.drupal.org/project/monolog) Drupal module to log Drupal log messages. I want to only log a range of levels. (Info - Warning to stdout, Error and up to stderr).\r\nThe Drupal Monolog module currently uses `setFormatter` to set a formatter.\r\n\r\nDon't know if this is good design, maybe this should be handled by the Drupal module. Input appreciated.\r\n\r\n--\r\nAh, I've just seen that the Drupal module uses the 1.x version of Monolog.\r\nAnd that the `FilterHandler` does not implement `FormattableHandlerInterface`.","closed_by":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/1386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
