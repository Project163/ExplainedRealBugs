Main page says: \"setting the MailHandler's $bubble argument to true means that all records will propagate to the StreamHandler\". But then Handler/AbstractHandler.php (line 141) goes:\n\n``` php\n/**\n* Sets the bubbling behavior.\n*\n* @param Boolean $bubble True means that bubbling is not permitted.\n* False means that this handler allows bubbling.\n* @return self\n*/\n```\n\nI'm not sure I have understood the Monolog meaning of bubbling, at this point. Nevertheless, I'm quite confident that having a TRUE value not permitting something, and a FALSE allowing it could cause some troubles to other people reading code, besides myself. Do you think it'd make sense to swap the two? Just sayin'... Keep up with the good work.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/comments/23591343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"maraspin","id":242968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mjk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/242968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin","html_url":"https://github.com/maraspin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraspin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":63321279,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjMzMjEyNzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/63321279","actor":{"login":"tback","id":83432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback","html_url":"https://github.com/tback","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-08-30T21:51:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":63321280,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDYzMzIxMjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/63321280","actor":{"login":"tback","id":83432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback","html_url":"https://github.com/tback","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tback/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-08-30T21:51:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":63321281,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjMzMjEyODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/63321281","actor":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek","html_url":"https://github.com/Seldaek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seldaek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-08-30T21:51:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":63321282,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDYzMzIxMjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seldaek/monolog/issues/events/63321282","actor":{"login":"Seldaek","id":183678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u
