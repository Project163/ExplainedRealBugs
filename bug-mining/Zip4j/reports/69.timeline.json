wonder which tool was used to create the zip file. It slightly deviated from the zip specification. Zip4j was designed to overcome such inconsistencies, but however, there was a problem with that logic which can arise in some specific circumstances. I fixed it. I will include the fix in the next release.\r\n\r\nTechnical info related to the error (if you are interested in details or for my future reference):  The entry in the zip file had a zip64 header written to it. When this entry is defined, the corresponding entries in the zip headers have to be defined as the maximum limit in the headers. For example, the compressed size in the header has to be set to set as `4294967295` when the corresponding compressed size in zip64 header is written. But this was not the case. The original length of ~ 8kb was written in the entry header.  I wonder why the tool was writing zip64 entry in the first place, because this header block is only supposed to be used when any of the sizes exceeds the usual 4 byte limit, but this was not the case in any of the sizes of this entry.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/578499790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/578505290","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/135#issuecomment-578505290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/135","id":578505290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODUwNTI5MA==","user":{"login":"shannah","id":2677562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzc1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2677562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah","html_url":"https://github.com/shannah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shannah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-26T14:09:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T14:09:17Z","body":"The
