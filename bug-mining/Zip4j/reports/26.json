I wanted to upgrade from 1.3.2 to 2.1.2, but have a question concerning the API change.\r\n\r\n**Use case**:\r\nI have to process incoming zip files. They can be encrypyed or not, I do not know upfront. If they are encrypted i know how to generate the password from the file name.\r\n\r\nWith the old API, I could create a `ZipFile` and check its encryption status, and if `true` I could set the password:\r\n\r\n```\r\nZipfile zip = new ZipFile(filename);\r\nif( zip.isEncrypted() ){\r\n  String password = generatePassword(filename);\r\n  zip.setPassword(password);\r\n}\r\n// ... process zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nAFAIK, with the new API, I can only set the password when creating the `ZipFile`. I cannot set it afterwards. Also not via the `ZipParameters`, which was  also possible with the old API.\r\n\r\n**Question**:\r\nHow can i handle this use case with the new API?\r\nOr in other term, what happens when I proactively/preventively supply a password, but the zip is not actually encrypted. Does extraction still work correctly?\r\n\r\n```\r\nString meaninglessPassword = generatePassword(nonEncryptedFilename);\r\nZipfile zip = new ZipFile(nonEncryptedFilename, meaninglessPassword);\r\n// ... process zip correctly?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this.","closed_by":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/44/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/44/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
