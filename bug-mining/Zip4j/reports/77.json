Because of the size limitation 65.535 files with the old zip, we changed to Zip4J 2.1.2 and now tried 2.5.0. None of the work correctly.\r\n\r\nThe first error was the same as described here: https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/39. Extraction stopped with the crc-exception.\r\n\r\nZip4J 2.1.4 and 2.5.0 don't give this error, but  with 2.5.0 some(!) extracted files with german Umlauts (ä,ö,ü) and other non-Ascii characters now contain garbage chars. With 1.3.1 they extract normally.\r\n\r\nEven more confusing is the fact, that not all characters are garbled. Sometime even the same subdirectory gets extracted twice, one time with the correct Umlaut and some files and a second time with the garbled char and the rest of the files.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea why this is happening? The archives were created with Zip4J 1.3.1 in one piece and have not been edited after creation. I can try to replicate the error with some non-confidential archives but this may take some time.","closed_by":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
