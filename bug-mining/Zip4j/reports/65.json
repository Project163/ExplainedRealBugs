The value byte is returned as an int in the range `0` to `255`. ...\r\n\r\nHowever, the `ZipInputStream.read()` simply returns `b[0]`, which is an integer in the range `-127` to `128` ([spec](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)). This needs to be converted to be in the correct range, e.g. by returning `b[0] & 0xff`.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is causing issues with trying to use Apache Commons' `BOMInputStream`; there, it assumes that the delegate stream won't return anything negative (unless, I guess, an EOF was encountered).","closed_by":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
