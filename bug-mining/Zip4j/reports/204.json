from email discussion)_\r\n\r\nWe are trying to use your zip4j library in order to create a zip file on an IBM z/OS Mainframe.\r\n\r\nThe file needs to be password protected with AES256 encryption.\r\n\r\nWe successfully deployed the java application using zip4j and the zip creation works without any errors.\r\n\r\nThe problem we encounter is that the created zip file cannot be unzipped using WinZip after transfer from the mainframe to a window machine.\r\n\r\nIf the unzipping is done on the mainframe it works as expected which leads us to believe that possibly something with the encryption is not compatible across the different platforms.\r\n\r\nIf zipping is done without encryption we do not encounter this issue and we are able to unzip the file using WinZip which was zipped on the mainframe.\r\n\r\n
