The linked code in the above comment is there to exactly prevent these issues. And in my further tests, zip4j throws an exception when the path is something other than path being extracted to, even if it is a parent path. \r\n\r\nFor example, the following code will fail with an exception (which is as expected):\r\n\r\n```\r\nZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile(BASE_DIR + \"sample.zip\", \"password\".toCharArray());\r\nZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();\r\nzipParameters.setFileNameInZip(\"../somename.pdf\");\r\nzipFile.addFile(new File(BASE_DIR + \"fileToAdd.pdf\"), zipParameters);\r\n\r\nzipFile.extractAll(BASE_DIR + \"test/extracted/\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I was able to reproduce the issue when the file name in zip has the same name as the directory being extracted to. For example the below code goes through without any exception, and the file is extracted not to `some` but to `test` directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\nZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile(BASE_DIR + \"sample.zip\", \"password\".toCharArray());\r\nZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();\r\nzipParameters.setFileNameInZip(\"../somename.pdf\");\r\nzipFile.addFile(new File(BASE_DIR + \"fileToAdd.pdf\"), zipParameters);\r\n\r\nzipFile.extractAll(BASE_DIR + \"test/some/\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference is that extraction path in the first example has `extracted` in the name whereas in the second example it is `some`, and this text begins with the file name `somename.pdf` which is written to the zip file. This is a very interesting find, because most of the documentation out there of how to handle such situations will also fail in such scenarios. Is it also the case in your code that the file name has the first characters same as the directory name being extracted to?  I will work on a fix, although I guess it might be a slightly tricky one.\r\n\r\nBTW, all this is only applicable in zip4j v2.x (and preferrably the latest version). zip4j 1.x does not have this fix.
