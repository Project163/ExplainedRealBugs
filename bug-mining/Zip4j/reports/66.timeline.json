I wonder as well the reasoning behind 7zip to not follow the zip specification of splitting files. This only makes interoperability between tools quite harder. I guess that 7z format has such split format and they stuck with using the same with zip files as well. However, this leads to the situation where split zip files created by 7zip cannot be read by other tools following zip specification. This is not the only instance where they do not follow zip specification. They have a similar behaviour with utf8 support which is not the default and they use system charset as the default, which is also a bit strange. There were some other instances as well where they took a different approach and not the specification, although I can't seem to remember them now.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will add a way in zip4j that supports reading such split files as well, because, unfortunately 7zip, while even though does not follow specification in some circumstances like this one, is a popular tool and people will end up having such split files, and it will be good to have support for it in zip4j.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/576004918/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2960891552,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk2MDg5MTU1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/events/2960891552","actor":{"login":"oleg-cherednik","id":7784672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODQ2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7784672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik","html_url":"https://github.com/oleg-cherednik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-19T13:31:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2960891553,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5NjA4OTE1NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/events/2960891553","actor":{"login":"oleg-cherednik","id":7784672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODQ2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7784672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik","html_url":"https://github.com/oleg-cherednik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oleg-cherednik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-19T13:31:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3084655873,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMwODQ2NTU4NzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/events/3084655873","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.
