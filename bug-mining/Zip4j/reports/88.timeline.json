writes file executable information in external file attributes as specified by the zip specification. I have just investigated this issue, and I can see that the executable flag is in fact being written in the external file attributes part of the zip headers. Try extracting the zip file created with zip4j with zip4j, 7zip, The Unarchiver or Keka, and you will see that the executable flag is in fact set for the extracted file. It is only the `unzip` command which doesn't seem to respect this flag. But according to zip specification, this is the section of the zip headers which define the executable flag of a file. ~~I guess the unzip command relies on one of InfoZip's extra data records to set the executable flag, which as far as I know, is not a must to be part of the zip file. To be able to define a file as executable or not, can be done with external file attributes and no additional extra data records are required for that. I am really not sure why `unzip` command does not respect these flags.~~\r\n\r\n~~> The problem is that Zip4j uses FAT file format instead of Unix.~~\r\n\r\n~~I am not sure what you mean by this. Zip4j tries to read the file attributes for the os on which the zip file is being generated. You can see the code [here][1] for Windows and [here][2] for mac and unix based systems. But in the end, these attributes are converted into a zip standard flags.~~\r\n\r\n~~BTW, which version of zip4j are you on? These features have been vastly improved in zip4j v 2.x compared to zip4j v 1.x.~~\r\n\r\n~~Honestly speaking, I am not quite sure if it is a bug in zip4j. AFAIK, zip4j is following the standards defined in zip specification, and as evident by other tools which set the executable flag for the files in zip generated by zip4j. I will remove the \"bug\" label on this issue. More research is needed on this issue to understand unzip command behaviour, but my best guess at the moment is that, as mentioned earlier, unzip command probably expects some custom InfoZip extra data record. But I will stop with my speculation here, and will do some more research into this, but at the moment it doesn't look like a bug in zip4j for me.~~\r\n\r\nUpdate: See comment below\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/blob/master/src/main/java/net/lingala/zip4j/util/FileUtils.java#L433\r\n[2]: https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/blob/master/src/main/java/net/lingala/zip4j/util/FileUtils.java#L454\r\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/631754094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3358504059,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzM1ODUwNDA1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/events/3358504059","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-20T22:09:30Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/631782160","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/183#issuecomment-631782160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/183","id":631782160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTc4MjE2MA==","user":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-20T23:01:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T09:43:30Z","body":"After some more research, I think I found the issue, and I understand the points you made with the FAT and Unix file format.
