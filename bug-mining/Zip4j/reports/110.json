Upon further investigation, the files all have permission `?---------` instead of the usual `-rw----`\r\n\r\nI am not very knowledgeable about ZIP headers, but my wild guess is [this commit](https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/commit/76db682d631052bb1e842a6570fc00cb00c28264). I have attached a debugger and the `setVersionMadeBy` value changed from the constant `20` to `819` (as the result of `determineVersionMadeBy` invocation).\r\n\r\nNote that my archive viewer also shows different values for the `OS` and `Version` columns (OS is \"Betriebssystem\" in German). Columns translate as follows:\r\nOriginal size | Compressed size | Saved space | Date | Time | Permissions | Method | Operating System | Version\r\n\r\n## **before** with Zip4j 2.5.2\r\n![2020-08-21-183600_750x86_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136469/90914155-b01a1b80-e3dd-11ea-8c1b-857f16eae11c.png)\r\n## **after** with Zip4j 2.6.0 / 2.6.1\r\n![2020-08-21-183759_754x85_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136469/90914157-b0b2b200-e3dd-11ea-8e4a-6c70a9c76240.png)\r\n\r\nI'd expect that I can continue to open files within the ZIP as usual. At first I was considering that it's the fault of my archive viewer, but please note that a user of my app (which in turn generates ZIP files with your library) reported the same problem under a different operating system: https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle/issues/600\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
