Reproduce\r\n1. `unzip` the scrambles zip\r\n2. `cd` on the extracted folder\r\n3. check the rights with `ls -l` for instance\r\n4. try to open it (if the rights where `----------` it should not work

I have also started some experiments to narrow down the issue.\r\n\r\nTo be precise, I built two releases of my app, one with Zip4j version `2.5.2` and one with `2.6.1`. I then continued to use each of them to generate a full ZIP file the way that normal users of my app would, on Manjaro Linux and Windows 10, respectively. The result is 4 different files (2 versions multiplied by 2 OSes) with the following observations about opening and extracting the ZIP:\r\n\r\n| ZIP generated on \\ opened on | Win | Linux |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\nLinux252 | Y | Y |\r\nLinux261 | Y | **N** |\r\nWindows252 | Y | Y |\r\nWindows261 | Y | Y |\r\n\r\nYou can find all 4 ZIP files attached to this post, nomenclature for the filenames should be obvious. Pick any PDF file and try to open it directly from the archive viewer, or extract it and open it from the extracted folder.

The Linux archivers then by default do not even _try_ to restore file permissions because they know it's not going to work (coming from a fat-esque FS) and assume `-rw----` as kind of a \"sane default\".\r\nNow with the `2.6.0` update you started writing `unix` headers, so the unzip utility goes like \"Hey, that's something that I can restore permissions from!\". But as the _actual_ permissions are never stored (cf. my `zipinfo -v` extract from above) it fails to restore them upon extraction.\r\n\r\nSuggested solution: Either (a) investigate how to write Unix file attributes or (b) kinda short-circuit the issue by allowing the user to force Windows mode.\r\n\r\nHope my explanation makes sense!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/679093838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gregorbg","id":6136469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzY0Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6136469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg","html_url":"https://github.com/gregorbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/679095621","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/231#issuecomment-679095621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/231","id":679095621,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3OTA5NTYyMQ==","user":{"login":"gregorbg","id":6136469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzY0Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6136469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg","html_url":"https://github.com/gregorbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-24T12:25:57Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T12:25:57Z","body":"In the linked document about the ZIP specification, it says under `4.4.15`:\r\n\r\n> 4.4.15 external file attributes: (4 bytes)\r\n>\r\n>       The mapping of the external attributes is\r\n>       host-system dependent (see 'version made by').

The big clue came to me in a screenshot you posted of the output of `zipinfo` command. The entries in the zip created by zip4j by using ZipFile api should have \"b-\" in one of the columns of the output, instead it was \"bl\". Having \"bl\" means that the entry has an extra data record associated with it, which, in case of zip file created with zip4j means that the file was added by ZipOutputStream and not the ZipFile api. I looked up the code in your repo, and [it seems][2] that you are using ZipOutputStream to create the zip file.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, I was able to reproduce this issue only when using ZipOutputStream (ZipFile api works fine). The issue is that when using ZipOutputStream, since it cannot determine the permission of the stream being added, zip4j does not set any file permissions (technically speaking it sets the value to 0). zip4j version <= 2.5.2 did not set the right versionMadeBy and versionNeededToExtract, and I presume (as you also did in one of your post above), the tool defaults to some basic permissions in that case. I will add a fix to write some default permissions in case of adding files via stream.\r\n\r\nTo answer the points you made in the posts above: Yes, InfoZip has added some extra headers for unix permissions, but zip specification also has a way to store these permissions in the header. This can be calculated by some complicated logic.

you for your thorough explanation and for promptly thinking of a fix! Reading all these interesting specifications about the ZIP format was so fascinating, maybe I went a bit overboard with my comments. Sorry! 😅\n\nI also understand the fundamental issue that the ZipOutputStream cannot possibly know the file permissions of the content that is written. My problem is that there's absolutely no way for me to write to a Java `File` (through the ZipFile implementation) because that has to actually exist somewhere on the disk, outside of the program itself.\n\nIn my specific use-case I only require the bytes in-memory and I cannot even afford to write stuff to a temporary file, read its bytes and then remove the temp file again. Therefore I'm relieved to hear that you're adding a fix :)\n\nThanks and keep up the great work!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/679303790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gregorbg","id":6136469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzY0Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6136469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg","html_url":"https://github.com/gregorbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregorbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3686853744,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM2ODY4NTM3NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/events/3686853744","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5f9cd8f7f119f3247e0911dc161c787235eaefec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/commits/5f9cd8f7f119f3247e0911dc161c787235eaefec","created_at":"2020-08-24T19:13:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/679842650","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/231#issuecomment-679842650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/231","id":679842650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3OTg0MjY1MA==","user":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-25T06:59:47Z","updated_at":"2020-08-25T06:59:47Z","body":"> maybe I went a bit overboard with my comments.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely not. I really appreciate that you actively contributed to the investigation. In fact it is your parallel investigation and effort that really helped me to find out the root cause of the issue. As I wrote in my post above, you have talked in one of your post about \"bl\" and \"bx\" and attached a screenshot. That clue was all I needed to go in the right path and figure out the issue. So, thanks a lot for your support.\r\n\r\nI totally understand that your use case requires you to use ZipOutputStream, and it is perfectly fine using ZipOutputStream. ZipOutputStream is there for exactly such purposes when you don't want to (and have to) deal with files. It does not make sense to write content to a temporary file just to add it to a zip file and then later delete the temporary file. A lot of overhead and unwanted processing.\r\n\r\nI will include the fix in the next release. I only have one more issue to fix, and then the next release is ready (unless nothing new comes up in the next couple of days).","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/679842650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3688585006,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzY4ODU4NTAwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/events/3688585006","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-25T07:00:02Z","label":{"name":"in-progress","color":"3ca7c1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3688585007,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM2ODg1ODUwMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/events/3688585007","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-25T07:00:02Z","label":{"name":"resolved","color":"b8dd11"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/680767866","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/231#issuecomment-680767866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/231","id":680767866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDc2Nzg2Ng==","user":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/us

[getUnixMode](https://javadoc.io/static/org.apache.commons/commons-compress/1.26.2/org/apache/commons/compress/archivers/zip/ZipArchiveEntry.html#getUnixMode()), [getCreationTime](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/zip/ZipEntry.html#getCreationTime--) and method [getLastAccessTime](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/zip/ZipEntry.html#getLastAccessTime--).\r\nIf it is possible to obtain these for encrypted zip files in zip4j, can you please create `getXXX` methods to retrieve them? Specifically in the `src/main/java/net/lingala/zip4j/model/LocalFileHeader.java` class. I have seen in #231 how you added the ability to capture the file permissions when writing a zip. If they are preserved in the zip file couldn't they be retrieved when reading a zip file?\r\n This may or may not be related to issue #460 in regards to file permissions.\r\nThank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/557/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
