It only takes slight more time when the folder already exists in zip file.\r\n\r\nWhen adding a file to a archive which containes a file with same name, zip4j will by default override the same name file(so are the folders). That means the zip4j will firstly remove the existing file in the archive, then add the new file. That's why adding a file to a archive which containes a file with same name takes more time.\r\nAnd the removing file procedure is implemented by removing file by file, which means it may take more time if the folder contains a lot of files. I think that's why you take a lot more time when adding a folder with the same folder existing in the zip.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want to override the same name file in zip, you can do it like this\r\n```\r\nZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile(\"/home/zipfile.zip\");\r\nZipParameters parameters = new ZipParameters();\r\nparameters.setOverrideExistingFilesInZip(false);\r\nzipFile.addFolder(new

just don't want being added. I tried getting all files manually and then using ZipFile#addFiles but now all files end up being in the root directory of the zip file.
