\r\nThe problem with Standard Zip Encryption is that there is no straight forward way to detect wrong password. At least I wasn't able to find it. The only way I know of is to try to extract the content and compare the crc after extraction. If crc comparison fails, this most likely means a wrong password. This however is not a confirmed way of saying that the password is wrong (it can be that the crc was wrongly calculated when zip file was created), but it most likely means a wrong password. AES encryption on the other hand provides a way to check for the password upfront, so a wrong password \"type\" in this case can be relied upon. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think at the moment, zip4j does not set the exception type as wrong_password in this case. This type should be set. I will include it in the next release.\r\n\r\n@fkirc \r\nI see what you mean by wrong password type getting converted to unknown type. I will look into this and fix it in the next release. And thanks for the pointer about a unit test for it.  I am surprised that there is no test case already.

comment has been taken out of the [official zip specification][1]. I have read this already as part of the zip specification. Unfortunately, it did not help me much. I experimented a bit but I could not figure out a solution for it.\r\n\r\nWhat I also noticed a few years back is that, some other famous tools (like Winzip, 7Zip, etc) also extract the whole file before showing user a wrong password message dialog. This happened with those tools only for ZipCrypto and not AES. In case of AES, those tools had a wrong password dialog almost immediately, but with ZipCrypto it took a lot of processing (depending on the file size in the zip) before this dialog showed up, which made me believe this was the only way to figure out a wrong password for ZipCrypto.\r\n\r\nI could very well be wrong, and there probably is a way to figure it out. If so, I would highly appreciate if someone can point me in the right direction, except for the specification document, which is, unfortunately, not really helpful.\r\n\r\n[1]:
