on this issue:\r\n[Issue #231](https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/231)\r\nPreviously we were zipping files using ZipOutputStream and we were getting 664 permissions.\r\nWith the new fix (from v. 2.6.2) we are getting 600 permissions.\r\nOur use case involves unzipping the file and leaving it in an sftp folder, then other users can get the unzipped file and download it to local machines.\r\nThis can't be done using 600, since the users trying to get the file are not owners.\r\nCould you please add default perm to 664 (as was before) instead of 600 ?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/266/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
