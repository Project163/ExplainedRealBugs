But I see your point. This might also lead to unclean code. You probably have to do something like this now:\r\n\r\n```\r\nZipOutputStream zipOutputStream;\r\n\r\nif (isEncrypted) {\r\n  zipOutputStream = new ZipOutputStream(outputstream, password);\r\n} else {\r\n  zipOutputStream = new ZipOutputStream(outputstream);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd pass in the isEncrypted flag to `createParameterSet()` method in your case. One tip is that you can always set the password to null if zip stream is not encrypted. This way you can avoid if...else block.\r\n\r\nWhen I redesigned the API, removing the password from ZipParameters felt right to me, because in older versions the password was on the ZipFile object (with a setter) and also on the ZipParameters object which lead to confusion and also inconsistency. I could not just include it on the ZipParameters object because this is only used for zipping and not used when unzipping, and therefore the only choice left was to have it on ZipFile object. One more reason is that with ZipFile api it was one additional line of code which can be passed in with a constructor.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/comments/522310912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2574398593,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNTc0Mzk4NTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/events/2574398593","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-21T20:25:33Z","assignee":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2574398755,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1NzQzOTg3NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/events/2574398755","actor":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-21T20:25:36Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"

guys. I'm working on this issue. As zip4j is well designed, I don't want to mess it up. Fixing this issue may introduce a new API, so please let me make it clear. Please let me know if I have any misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nBasicly I think re-introducing the `ZipFile.setPassword()` would solve this problem. I think the `setPassword` should be limited in `ZipFile` only, not in ZipOutputStream or ZipParameters, just as @srikanth-lingala noticed:\r\n\r\n> I could not just include it on the ZipParameters object because this is only used for zipping and not used when unzipping, and therefore the only choice left was to have it on ZipFile object.\r\n\r\nBut for this suggestion as @frankMilde mentioned:\r\n\r\n> if you do initialize ZipFile/Stream with a password, automatically set the params to encrption=true or even more, provide a default set of encryptionFiles/Method/Keystrength settings in this case\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a good idea. Currently the password in `ZipFile` is already used in unzipping files(e.g. `extractFile`, `extractFile`), but not in zipping(e.g. `addFile`, `addFiles`, `addFolder`, `addStream`). They will create a new ZipParameters if the ZipParameters is not specified. The new created ZipParameters is default to set `encryptFiles=false`, even if password is specified in `ZipFile`. I think @frankMilde would like us to provide a default set of settings when password is specified in `ZipFile`, for example:\r\n```\r\nencryptFiles = true\r\nencryptionMethod = EncryptionMethod.ZIP_STANDARD\r\n```\r\nTherefore the user do not need to create a new `ZipParameters` and set these settings. Am I right @frankMilde ?\r\n\r\nBut I think this may mislead the users. They may be unaware of the encryption method that is default to be used then.
