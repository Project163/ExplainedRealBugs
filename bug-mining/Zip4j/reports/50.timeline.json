35kb.\r\n\r\nI tested on a mac. To extract the file, it took ~ 27 seconds with v2.2.6 and took ~ 19 seconds with v1.3.2. Although it is not a 10x difference that you have seen, it is still a considerable difference, and I presume the difference between your and my results are because of hardware configuration, and probably also the OS. \r\n\r\nI think I know the reason for this behaviour. I did a fix. After that v2.2.7-SNAPSHOT takes ~ 20 seconds, which is pretty much close to the v1.3.2. Can you please try with v2.2.7-SNAPSHOT?
