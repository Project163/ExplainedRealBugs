On the other hand calling `headerReader.readLocalFileHeader()` to obtain `LocalFileHeader` is possible without password and there `isEncrypted()` can be checked.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately `getNextEntry()` doesn't execute some \"password callback\" in case this is detected but tries to extract right away after obtaining `LocalFileHeader`.\r\n\r\nCalling `headerReader.readLocalFileHeader()` first and then `getNextEntry()` causes skipping of files because `headerReader.readLocalFileHeader()` moves the position in the stream of course.\r\n\r\nTo solve this please provide something like \"password callback\" setter which will be executed if no password was provided and file is encrypted.","closed_by":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
