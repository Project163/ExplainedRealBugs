there,\r\n  we are upgrading our zip4j dependency from 1.3.2 to 2.1.0, although we were able to substitue several constructors and functions (such as Zip4jConstants.COMP_STORE to CompressionMethod.STORE, etc), we cannot find the substitution of ZipParameters::setRootFolderInZip function, can you give us any idea about how should we upgrade it to zip4j version 2?","closed_by":{"login":"srikanth-lingala","id":3450302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTAzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3450302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala","html_url":"https://github.com/srikanth-lingala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikanth-lingala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/97/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/97/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
