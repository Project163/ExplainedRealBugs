herring(s) preserved for the curious, but otherwise a distractor to the documentation issues originally presented</summary>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQuestion: Besides backward compatibility, why not lean exclusively on watchgod for all reload behavior and only provide those capabilities if watchgod is installed?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe plot thickens…. After installing `uvicorn[standard]`, this works to detect `*.env` changes:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n% uvicorn \\\r\n     --reload \\\r\n     --reload-exclude '*_flymake.py' \\\r\n     --reload-exclude 'flycheck_*.py' \\\r\n     --reload-dir /path/to/first_dir \\\r\n     --reload-exclude '*_flymake.py' \\\r\n     --reload-exclude 'flycheck_*.py' \\\r\n     --reload-dir /path/to/second_dir \\\r\n     --reload-include '*.env' \\\r\n     --reload-dir /path/to/env_dir \\\r\n     mm.txns.main:app\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it _**stopped**_ working for detecting `*.py` changes in `/path/to/first_dir` and `/path/to/second_dir`. (It still detects changes to `*.py` files in `/path/to/env_dir`, bizarrely.)\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n% uvicorn \\\r\n     --reload \\\r\n     --reload-exclude '*_flymake.py' \\\r\n     --reload-exclude 'flycheck_*.py' \\\r\n     --reload-dir /path/to/first_dir \\\r\n     --reload-exclude '*_flymake.py' \\\r\n     --reload-exclude 'flycheck_*.py' \\\r\n     --reload-dir /path/to/second_dir \\\r\n     --reload-include '*.env' \\\r\n     --reload-dir /path/to/env_dir \\\r\n     mm.txns.main:app\r\n```\r\n\r\nNone of what I'm observing makes sense to me, even after reading [`watchgodreload.py`](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn/blob/master/uvicorn/supervisors/watchgodreload.py), so I'm pretty sure there is some attention needed here.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_UPDATE: Okay, I _**think**_ I see part of the problem (at least with watchgod). I'm running `uvicorn` in VirtualBox via Vagrant. `/path/to/first_dir` and `/path/to/second_dir` are mounted inside the guest from the host. (However, they are writeable, but that doesn't help things.) uvicorn's non-watchgod implementation doesn't support inclusion as needed (discussed above) and watchgod seems to want to ignore guest-mounted directories entirely. In either case, the behavior and limitations are not well documented. I'm assuming the failure to watch a guest-mounted filesystem is a bug, but the collection of undocumented limitations leaves me to conclude that there's no option that will satisfy my use case. It required about three hours of time to figure this out. I don't think there's any hope anyone could glean any of this from the docs as written. I don't think it's even clear that `--reload-include` requires watchgod._\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_SECOND UPDATE: I believe I have chased the root cause to why watchgod doesn't notice changes in my setup to this: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10660. So let's treat that as a red herring._\r\n\r\n_I think this should be treated like a documentation bug (as was originally intended) in that the existing docs do not adequately describe the observed behaviors and limitations either with and without watchgod._\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_THIRD UPDATE: Nope. watchgod doesn't use `inotify`. It uses `poll`, which works,_ sometimes, _but I'm not sure when it does and when it doesn't._\r\n\r\n_I still think there's a serious problem with the documentation, but I'll ignore the `inotify`/`poll`/`vboxsf` mount weirdness for now._\r\n\r\n</detail>","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/comments/1013746860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"posita","id":222581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/222581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita","html_url":"https://github.com/posita","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/comments/1013811558","html_url":"https://github.com/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/1326#issuecomment-1013811558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/1326","id":1013811558,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBYpCG848bYlm","user":{"login":"posita","id":222581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/222581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita","html_url":"https://github.com/posita","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-16T05:01:00Z","updated_at":"2022-01-16T05:01:00Z","body":"Okay, I might have gotten my understanding of the above wrong as well.

I can't see how anyone could reasonably understand that from the current docs, though.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/comments/1013811558/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"posita","id":222581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/222581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita","html_url":"https://github.com/posita","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posita/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/comments/1013853346","html_url":"https://github.com/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/1326#issuecomment-1013853346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/1326","id":1013853346,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBYpCG848biyi","user":{"login":"Andrew-Chen-Wang","id":60190294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTkwMjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60190294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang","html_url":"https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Chen-Wang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-16T10:55:50Z","updated_at":"2022-01-16T10:55:50Z","body":"Awesome investigation and apologies for the wrong advice.
