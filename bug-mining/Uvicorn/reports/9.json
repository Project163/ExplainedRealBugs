Specifically I'm talking about the first line in `8.1.2.1 Negotiation` quoted here:\r\n> An HTTP/1.1 server MAY assume that a HTTP/1.1 client intends to maintain a persistent connection unless a Connection header including the connection-token \"close\" was sent in the request. If the server chooses to close the connection immediately after sending the response, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the connection-token close.\r\n\r\nThe wording is maybe a little ambiguous but to me it definitely seems to imply that if the server closes the connection (wether due to a `connection: close` header in the request or by it's own choice) it should return a `connection: close` header.
