I investigated further and found that the reload option uses a very simple implementation of a file change watcher that consume a lot of resources.\r\n\r\nI propose to use the [watchdog](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) library when available for that.\r\n\r\nI have done and initial implementation [here](https://github.com/davidrios/uvicorn/commit/a693486c72b2e63345e1653dcb0777cbedf18618).
