Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] There are no similar issues or pull requests for this yet.\r\n- [x] I discussed this idea on the [community chat](https://gitter.im/encode/community) and feedback is positive.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nThe issue is: I have a script using uvicorn.run, but I can only run it from a specific cwd, else it will fail with ImportError.\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you would like.\r\n\r\nI would like the --app-dir functionality to be available in uvicorn.run() as well.\r\nI.e.: to be able to run a script containing a call to uvicorn.run regardless of the cwd.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you considered\r\n\r\nDoing it myself, i.e. calling sys.path.insert(0, abs_path_to_my_project_root_folder), but it feels to me that if this functionality is implemented in main() but not in run() (which from reading the code are the same thing) there must be something wrong with the uvicorn code.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/encode/uvicorn/issues/549\r\nhttps://github.com/encode/uvicorn/pull/619\r\nhttps://github.com/encode/uvicorn/commit/77468df7697ec2f2962e77d7a02e0bc22b6f9c79\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this commit implemented the behaviour in the wrong place. Instead of 'consuming' the app_dir argument inside main(), it should have been passed down as-is to run() where it will be processed.\r\n\r\n(I volunteer to do the job, if we agree that there is a problem) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/1126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/1126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/comments/1370488010","html_url":"https://github.com/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/549#issuecomment-1370488010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/549","id":1370488010,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBYpCG85Rr_zK","user":{"login":"Sub0X","id":74270733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjcwNzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74270733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X","html_url":"https://github.com/Sub0X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-04T04:57:30Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T04:57:30Z","body":"Following this question, is it possible to also have an app-dir kwarg for uvicorn.Config?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kludex/uvicorn/issues/comments/1370488010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Sub0X","id":74270733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjcwNzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74270733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X","html_url":"https://github.com/Sub0X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sub0X/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
