 ## Development
 
-* `--reload` - Enable auto-reload.
+* `--reload` - Enable auto-reload. Uvicorn supports two versions of auto-reloading behavior enabled by this option. There are important differences between them.
 * `--reload-dir <path>` - Specify which directories to watch for python file changes. May be used multiple times. If unused, then by default the whole current directory will be watched. If you are running programmatically use `reload_dirs=[]` and pass a list of strings.
+
+### Reloading without watchgod
+
+If Uvicorn _cannot_ load [watchgod](https://pypi.org/project/watchgod/) at runtime, it will periodically look for changes in modification times to all `*.py` files (and only `*.py` files) inside of its monitored directories. See the `--reload-dir` option. Specifying other file extensions is not supported unless watchgod is installed. See the `--reload-include` and `--reload-exclude` options for details.
+
+### Reloading with watchgod
+
+For more nuanced control over which file modifications trigger reloads, install `uvicorn[standard]`, which includes watchgod as a dependency. Alternatively, install [watchgod](https://pypi.org/project/watchgod/) where Unvicorn can see it. This will enable the following options (which are otherwise ignored).
+
 * `--reload-include <glob-pattern>` - Specify a glob pattern to match files or directories which will be watched. May be used multiple times. By default the following patterns are included: `*.py`. These defaults can be overwritten by including them in `--reload-exclude`.
 * `--reload-exclude <glob-pattern>` - Specify a glob pattern to match files or directories which will excluded from watching. May be used multiple times. By default the following patterns are excluded: `.*, .py[cod], .sw.*, ~*`. These defaults can be overwritten by including them in `--reload-include`.
 
-By default Uvicorn uses simple changes detection strategy that compares python files modification times few times a second. If this approach doesn't work for your project (eg. because of its complexity), or you need watching of non python files you can install [watchgod](https://pypi.org/project/watchgod/) or install uvicorn with `uvicorn[standard]`, which will include watchgod.

 ## Production
 
 * `--workers <int>` - Use multiple worker processes. Defaults to the `$WEB_CONCURRENCY` environment variable if available, or 1.
