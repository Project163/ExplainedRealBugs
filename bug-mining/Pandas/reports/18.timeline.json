\r\nUnfortunately, the `columns` parameter behaves differently than expected with various input types. While I encountered the intended behavior as described in the other thread with dictionaries, the results were different when I used Numpy's structured array or a list of tuples. \r\n\r\n- **Numpy's structred array**: The `Columns` parameter doesn't appear to have any filtering effect on a structured array. All columns are included in the original order, regardless of what's specified in columns.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/373e6213-fb2b-4364-b23b-b09b7f1fb044)\r\n\r\n\r\n- **List of tuples**: The `Columns` parameter only assigns names to the columns. It doesn't filter or reorder the data. Additionally, it raises an error if fewer column names are provided than the number of columns in the input

Pandas version checks\r\n\r\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\r\n\r\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\r\n\r\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Example\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ndata = np.array([\r\n    ('John', 25, 'New York', 50000),\r\n    ('Jane', 30, 'San Francisco', 75000),\r\n    ('Bob', 35, 'Chicago', 65000),\r\n    ('Alice', 28, 'Los Angeles', 60000)\r\n], dtype=[('name', 'U10'), ('age', 'i4'), ('city', 'U15'), ('salary', 'i4')])\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame.from_records(data, columns=['salary', 'city', 'age', 'name'])\r\n\r\nprint(df)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\n\r\nThe `columns` parameter doesn't appear to reorder the columns when the input data is a structured array, even though the documentation says it should. (It does do this for other data types.) In addition, the argument doesn't filter the columns like it does for other input types like dict (a behavior which isn't documented yet, but which will be -- see #59670).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAccording to the discussion in #15319 and #59670, DataFrame.from_records()'s columns argument should allow the users to reorder columns (and include only specific columns) from the Numpy's structured array the way it works for data passed as a dictionary. \r\n\r\n### Installed Versions\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\r\n------------------\r\ncommit              : a671b5a8bf5dd13fb19f0e88edc679bc9e15c673\r\npython              : 3.10.12.final.0\r\npython-bits         : 64\r\nOS                  : Linux\r\nOS-release          : 6.1.85+\r\nVersion             : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Jun 27 21:05:47 UTC 2024\r\nmachine             : x86_64\r\nprocessor           : x86_64\r\nbyteorder           : little\r\nLC_ALL              : en_US.UTF-8\r\nLANG                : en_US.UTF-8\r\nLOCALE              : en_US.UTF-8\r\n\r\npandas              : 2.1.4\r\nnumpy               : 1.26.4\r\npytz                : 2024.1\r\ndateutil            : 2.8.2\r\nsetuptools          : 71.0.4\r\npip                 : 24.1.2\r\nCython              : 3.0.11\r\npytest              : 7.4.4\r\nhypothesis          : None\r\nsphinx              : 5.0.2\r\nblosc               : None\r\nfeather             : None\r\nxlsxwriter          : None\r\nlxml.etree          : 4.9.4\r\nhtml5lib            : 1.1\r\npymysql             : None\r\npsycopg2            : 2.9.9\r\njinja2              : 3.1.4\r\nIPython             : 7.34.0\r\npandas_datareader   : 0.10.0\r\nbs4                 : 4.12.3\r\nbottleneck          : None\r\ndataframe-api-compat: None\r\nfastparquet         : None\r\nfsspec              : 2024.6.1\r\ngcsfs               : 2024.6.1\r\nmatplotlib          : 3.7.1\r\nnumba               : 0.60.0\r\nnumexpr             : 2.10.1\r\nodfpy               : None\r\nopenpyxl            : 3.1.5\r\npandas_gbq          : 0.23.1\r\npyarrow             : 14.0.2\r\npyreadstat          : None\r\npyxlsb              : None\r\ns3fs                : None\r\nscipy               : 1.13.1\r\nsqlalchemy          : 2.0.32\r\ntables              : 3.8.0\r\ntabulate            : 0.9.0\r\nxarray              : 2024.6.0\r\nxlrd                : 2.0.1\r\nzstandard           : None\r\ntzdata              : 2024.1\r\nqtpy                : None\r\npyqt5               : None\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59717/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ammar-qazi","id":177272062,"node_id":"U_kgDOCpD0_g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177272062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi","html_url":"https://github.com/ammar-qazi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammar-qazi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-05T19:35:32Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T19:35:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59723","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59723/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59723/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59723/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/59723","id":2508573358,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAA0YD856kWqg","number":59723,"title":"Resolves #59670 by documenting that DataFrame.from_records()'s columns filters (includes) data.
