you @KinzigFlyer for the in depth write up. I have made a pull request (#60211) with changes that should fix the bug along with a regression test.\r\n\r\nPictured below is the given Reproducible Example when run on the current main branch of pandas:\r\n![plot_b1_example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5370b5b5-4baa-491e-8714-dfff2e2be703)\r\n\r\nHere is the given Reproducible Example when run on the fix:\r\n![fixed_plot_b1_example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7c4b2b1-4e4c-4b74-89f9-b710c3017f23)\r\n(Notice that the errant number labels are moved to the tops of the bars.)\r\n\r\nHere is the regression test case when run on the current main branch of pandas:\r\n![test_case](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed48af19-20c3-4468-b03a-84e3464003e9)\r\n\r\nHere is the regression test case when run on the fix:\r\n![test_case_fixed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b93be76-ab4d-4cf7-96f3-3ef5cae26239)\r\n(Notice that the leftmost column's orange bar slice of zero height now has the label '3' which overlaps with the blue label '3', making it appear bold. Also notice the middle column's '0' label becomes less bold, and the '2' label becomes more bold for the same reasons.)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the pull request fixes the bug to match the expected behavior. It should be noted that there is some ambiguity to the expected behavior. Should bar slices of zero height still display labels? This behavior causes labels to overlap which makes them appear bolded as stated before. I do not know the intended behavior here, but am willing to make changes to my pull request to match it if a maintainer suggests one way or the other. My current pull request takes the path of least impact, and display labels even for bar slices of zero
