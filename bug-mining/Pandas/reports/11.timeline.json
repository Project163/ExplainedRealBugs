Your second example some_rows = df.iloc[lambda df: (1, 0)] should fail because tuples should fail if the index is not a MultiIndex. OTOH, some_rows = df.iloc[lambda df: [1, 0]] (a list) should work.\r\n\r\nHold on. That would mean that with `callable` syntax it is impossible to pull out rows and columns in one go. Or is it rather that tuple-destructuring happens first and _then_ if any entry is a callable it is called to construct a key for that axis. So that if I wanted to achieve the same thing as `df.iloc[1, 0]` with lambdas, I should do `df.iloc[lambda df: 1, lambda df: 0]` ?\r\n\r\nIf so, then callables should ~be allowed to return tuples (since that enables them to return a singleton index into a multiindex), but the restriction is that the return value is not destructured using the rules for axis-destructuring.~\r\n not be allowed to return tuples for `iloc` indexing (which this bug report is about) since those indices will be invalid. So, I think that one could just let them return and let the next step raise an `IndexError` as appropriate.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly then, the proposed \"correct\" evaluation order for a key is:\r\n\r\n1. destructure tuple by axis: `key => row_key, col_key` (if a dataframe; if a series, this should raise `IndexingError` if there is a tuple with more than one entry)\r\n2. apply callables if existing: `row_key => row_key(frame)`, `col_key => col_key(frame)` if either is `callable`\r\n3. apply non-destructuring/non-callable `iloc`-indexing semantics to the row and column keys separately\r\n\r\nFrom what I observe (when checking for bug overlap, and so forth) I think that the heuristics for desugaring user input to \"normalized\" keys are ambiguous in the presence of multiindices (for `loc`, I think they shouldn't be for `iloc` since multiindices don't exist in the iloc space). But I'd like to understand what the semantics should be for desugared input (and can then update the docs appropriately to describe how the desugaring takes place).\r\n\r\n[Part of the reason for

Description\r\nTo simplify the low-level implementation of iloc-based getitem on both\r\nSeries and DataFrames, change the dispatching approach to parse the\r\nuser-provided \"unstructured\" key into structured data (an appropriate\r\ntagged union using new dataclasses). At the libcudf level, there are four\r\nstyles of indexing we can do:\r\n\r\n1. index by slice\r\n2. index by mask\r\n3. index by map\r\n4. index by scalar\r\n\r\niloc keys are parsed into information that tags them by type and\r\nnormalises the key to an appropriate column or other low-level object.\r\n\r\nThis centralises the business logic for index parsing in a\r\nsingle place, and ensures that downstream consumers of the validated\r\nand normalised indexer don't need to inspect it again to determine\r\nwhat to do. Note that we treat index by scalar as composition of index\r\nby map with get_element (since that simplifies the logic when\r\nextracting the single row of a dataframe: we want to keep it on\r\ndevice), but the scalar \"type tag\" allows us to determine this\r\nunambiguously without reinspecting the key.\r\n\r\nThe major benefits will come when updating loc-based getitem (where\r\nthe parsing rules are more complicated, but eventually turn into one\r\nof the above four cases). In this latter case, we will no longer\r\nattempt to turn a loc-based key into a \"user-facing\" key for iloc, but\r\nrather will call directly into the pre-parsed interface.\r\n\r\nThat said, we already provide some performance improvements since we\r\nonly do inspection once.\r\n\r\n- Closes #13013\r\n- Closes #13267\r\n- Closes #13515\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] I am familiar with the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] New or existing tests cover these changes.\r\n- [ ] The documentation is up to date with these changes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/comments/1583436291","html_url":"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/53533#issuecomment-1583436291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/53533","id":1583436291,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAA0YD85eYVID","user":{"login":"topper-123","id":26364415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY0NDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26364415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123","html_url":"https://github.com/topper-123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topper-123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-08T21:50:29Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T21:50:29Z","body":"Yes, I think that sound right.
