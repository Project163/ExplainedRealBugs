Using your code example from above, the object dtype instance from the unpickled array is different from the \"default\" instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> t.dtype is np.dtype(\"object\")\r\nTrue\r\n>>> tp.dtype is np.dtype(\"object\")\r\nFalse\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then I assume that `np.asarray(.., dtype=\"object\")` uses such a check above, and therefore returns the original array in case of `t` but
