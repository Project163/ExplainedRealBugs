Pandas 1.5.3, the `float(val)` cast was inline to the `cast_from_unit` call in `array_with_unit_to_datetime`. This caused the intermediate (unnamed) value to be a Python float.\r\n\r\nSince #50301, a temporary variable was added to avoid multiple casts, but with explicit type `cdef float`, which defines a _Cython_ float. This type is 32-bit, and causes a loss of precision, and a regression in parsing from 1.5.3.\r\n\r\nSince `cast_from_unit` takes an `object`, not a more specific Cython type, remove the explicit type from the temporary `fval` variable entirely. This will cause it to be a (64-bit) Python float, and thus not lose precision.\r\n\r\nFixes #57051\r\n\r\n- [x] closes #xxxx (Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number)\r\n- [x] [Tests added and
