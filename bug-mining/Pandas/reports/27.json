Pandas version checks\n\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\n\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\n\n\n### Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n'datetime' : pd.date_range('1/1/2011', periods=3, freq='h'),\n'value' : [1,2,3]\n})\n\ndf.iloc[0,0] = None\ndf.fillna(pd.Timestamp('0001-01-01'), inplace=True)\n```\n\n### Issue Description\n\nIssue is similar to [this closed issue without a reproducible example](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/56502 ).\n\nA DataFrame that has a column with datetime64[ns] with NaT gets an error if trying to fill null values with a pd.Timestamp that lies outside the range of the given precision.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe null values in the DataFrame should be replaced with the provided TimeStamp or an error should be provided to the user that the Timestamps have incompatible precisions and ranges.\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n<details>\n\nINSTALLED
