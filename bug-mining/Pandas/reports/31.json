Given that the attrs manual states that \"many operations that create new datasets will retain attrs\", this seems like an omission.\n\n### Feature Description\n\nJoin is different from concat because there is a clear dataframe that the operation is on. Therefore, it would seem natural if df.join() would retain the attrs of the initial dataframe.\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\nIt would also be possible to make the attrs dependent on \"how\" but this would only be natural for \"left\" and \"right\".\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mroeschke","id":10647082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ3MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10647082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke","html_url":"https://github.com/mroeschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/60351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/60351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
