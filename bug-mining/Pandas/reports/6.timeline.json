Pandas version checks\r\n\r\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\r\n\r\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Example\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas
