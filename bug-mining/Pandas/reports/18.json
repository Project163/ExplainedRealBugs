Pandas version checks\r\n\r\n- [X] I have checked that the issue still exists on the latest versions of the docs on `main` [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Location of the documentation\r\n\r\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.from_records.html\r\n\r\n### Documentation problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's not clear from the `DataFrame.from_records()` docs that the `columns` argument to `from_records()` also has the effect of what an `include` argument (or `usecols`) would do. Indeed, the current wording once led someone to file a feature request asking for an `include` argument to be added: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15319\r\nHowever, the request was later closed when the maintainers realized the `columns` argument already does this (but it's not documented, hence this issue).\r\n\r\n### Suggested fix for documentation\r\n\r\nAdd a sentence or phrase to the documentation of the `columns` argument that the  argument also has the effect of limiting the DataFrame to including only the columns specified. This isn't implied by the current wording, or it's at least a little ambiguous.","closed_by":{"login":"mroeschke","id":10647082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ3MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10647082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke","html_url":"https://github.com/mroeschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59670/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
