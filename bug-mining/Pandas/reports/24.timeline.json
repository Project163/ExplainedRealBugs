[GH-61123](#)  \r\nWhen reading Excel files with `pd.read_excel` and specifying `nrows=4`, the behavior differs depending on whether there’s a blank row between tables. For a file with two tables (each with a header and 3 data rows), `nrows=4` should yield a DataFrame with one header and 3 data rows (shape `(3, n)`). However:\r\n- In `test1.xlsx` (with a blank row), it correctly reads the first table (header + 3 rows).\r\n- In `test2.xlsx` (no blank row), it incorrectly includes the second table’s header as a data row, resulting in a shape of `(4, n)`.\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency occurs because `read_excel` doesn’t properly respect table boundaries when tables are adjacent, despite the `nrows` limit.\r\n\r\n**Fix**:  \r\n- Modified `pandas/io/excel/_base.py` and related reader modules (`_openpyxl.py`, `_pyxlsb.py`, `_xlrd.py`) to ensure `nrows` limits reading to the specified number of rows, excluding subsequent table headers even when tables are adjacent.\r\n- Added a new test `test_excel_read_tables_with_and_without_blank_row` in `pandas/tests/io/excel/test_readers.py` to verify that `nrows=4` consistently returns a DataFrame with shape `(3, 2)` (header + 3 data rows) for both cases.\r\n\r\n**Changes**:\r\n- Updated Excel reader logic to stop at `nrows` without parsing beyond table boundaries.\r\n- Ensured consistent behavior across `openpyxl`, `pyxlsb`, and `xlrd` engines.\r\n- Squashed commits into a single commit for clarity.\r\n\r\n**Verification**:\r\n- Tested with `test1.xlsx` (blank row) and `test2.xlsx` (no blank row).\r\n- Confirmed both now yield a DataFrame with shape `(3, 2)` and only the first table’s data.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Test**:\r\n1. Run `pytest pandas/tests/io/excel/test_readers.py::TestReaders::test_excel_read_tables_with_and_without_blank_row`.\r\n2. Verify `df1.shape == (3, 2)` and `df2.shape == (3, 2)` match the expected output.\r\n\r\n**Related Files**:\r\n- `pandas/io/excel/_base.py`\r\n- `pandas/io/excel/_openpyxl.py`\r\n-

[GH-61123](#)  \r\nWhen reading Excel files with `pd.read_excel` and specifying `nrows=4`, the behavior differs depending on whether there’s a blank row between tables. For a file with two tables (each with a header and 3 data rows), `nrows=4` should yield a DataFrame with one header and 3 data rows (shape `(3, n)`). However:\r\n- In `test1.xlsx` (with a blank row), it correctly reads the first table (header + 3 rows).\r\n- In `test2.xlsx` (no blank row), it incorrectly includes the second table’s header as a data row, resulting in a shape of `(4, n)`.\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency occurs because `read_excel` doesn’t properly respect table boundaries when tables are adjacent, despite the `nrows` limit.\r\n\r\n**Fix**:  \r\n- Modified `pandas/io/excel/_base.py` and related reader modules (`_openpyxl.py`, `_pyxlsb.py`, `_xlrd.py`) to ensure `nrows` limits reading to the specified number of rows, excluding subsequent table headers even when tables are adjacent.\r\n- Added a new test `test_excel_read_tables_with_and_without_blank_row` in `pandas/tests/io/excel/test_readers.py` to verify that `nrows=4` consistently returns a DataFrame with shape `(3, 2)` (header + 3 data rows) for both cases.\r\n\r\n**Changes**:\r\n- Updated Excel reader logic to stop at `nrows` without parsing beyond table boundaries.\r\n- Ensured consistent behavior across `openpyxl`, `pyxlsb`, and `xlrd` engines.\r\n- Squashed commits into a single commit for clarity.\r\n\r\n**Verification**:\r\n- Tested with `test1.xlsx` (blank row) and `test2.xlsx` (no blank row).\r\n- Confirmed both now yield a DataFrame with shape `(3, 2)` and only the first table’s data.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Test**:\r\n1. Run `pytest pandas/tests/io/excel/test_readers.py::TestReaders::test_excel_read_tables_with_and_without_blank_row`.\r\n2. Verify `df1.shape == (3, 2)` and `df2.shape == (3, 2)` match the expected output.\r\n\r\n**Related Files**:\r\n- `pandas/io/excel/_base.py`\r\n- `pandas/io/excel/_openpyxl.py`\r\n- `pandas/io/excel/_pyxlsb.py`\r\n- `pandas/io/excel/_xlrd.py`\r\n- `pandas/tests/io/excel/test_readers.py`\r\n\r\nCloses #61123","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/comments/2736648773","html_url":"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61123#issuecomment-2736648773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61123","id":2736648773,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAA0YD86jHfJF","user":{"login":"rhshadrach","id":45562402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTYyNDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45562402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach","html_url":"https://github.com/rhshadrach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhshadrach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-19T13:27:07Z","updated_at":"2025-03-19T13:27:07Z","body":"Thanks for the report.
