From the stata documentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n           The use of a 5-byte integer is awfully odd.  In the previous 117\r\n           .dta format, the (v,o) values were written as two 4-byte values.\r\n           This accommodated Stata's then-current maximum of roughly 32,000\r\n           variables and roughly 2,000,000,000 observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n           In the 118 format used in modern Stata when there are 32,767\r\n           variables or less, the (v,o) values are written as a 2-byte value\r\n           followed by a 6-byte value to allow for more observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Since then, Stata has learned to deal with more variables and v no\r\n           longer can be stored in just 2 bytes in the 119 format.  Stata\r\n           allows up to 100,000 variables and up to 1 terabyte observations.\r\n           This combination of numbers can be stored in a 3-byte integer and\r\n           a 5-byte integer.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe docs make it sound like 32,000 is the limit for <= 118, and only 119 can do more.
