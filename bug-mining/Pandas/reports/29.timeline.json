from 2013 by @jreback as part of a broader set of fixes (GH4204, GH4463) related to Series/indexing and type coercion — notably when `Series` still subclassed `ndarray`.\n\nBack then, checking for `.name` may have been a lightweight proxy to identify Series-like objects without introducing tight coupling, but now that we have proper ABCs (`ABCSeries`, `ABCIndexClass`), it seems more robust to explicitly check types via `isinstance`.\n\nSo unless there's some subtle compatibility case that still requires relying on `.name`, I’d proceed with:\n\n```python\nelif isinstance(data, (ABCSeries,

Fix DataFrame constructor misclassification of array-like with 'name' attribute\r\n\r\nPreviously, any object with a `.name` attribute (like some `vtkArray`-like objects) was assumed to be a `Series` or `Index`, causing the DataFrame constructor to misinterpret the input and raise errors when passed valid 2D array-likes.\r\n\r\nThis fix ensures we only apply the named-Series/Index logic when the input is **actually** an instance of `ABCSeries` or `ABCIndex`, and the `name` is not `None`.\r\n\r\nA new test was added to ensure array-like subclasses with `.name` are handled correctly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] Closes #61443\r\n- [x] Tests added and passing\r\n- [x] Code passes all checks via `pre-commit`\r\n- [x] Behavior verified with array-like + `.name` case\r\n- [x]

Pandas version checks\n\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\n\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\n\n\n### Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a structured array with alignment-sensitive types\ndtype = np.dtype([('x', np.int64), ('y', np.float64)])\narr = np.zeros(10, dtype=dtype)\n\n# Wrap into DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(arr)\n\n# Trigger complex alignment path\ntry:\n    # Operation that depends on consistent field layout\n    df_sum = df.sum(numeric_only=True)\n    print(\"Sum result:\", df_sum)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Failure during structured alignment test:\", e)\n```\n\n### Issue Description\n\n### Summary\nPandas may be vulnerable to ABI and memory alignment issues caused by C23 default behaviors in GCC 15.1. Silent adoption of padding behavior changes — particularly in union or struct definitions used in NumPy or Pandas C extensions — may lead to unpredictable runtime behavior.\n\nThis issue was originally identified in NumPy and Cython. As Pandas includes both compiled Cython code and relies on NumPy for internal memory layout, it is downstream vulnerable.\n\nThese compiled pieces are sensitive to pointer alignment, ABI expectations, or padding behaviors — especially across environments.\n\n### Reproducible Example\nPlease see section below\n\nPossibly related to:\n- [BUG: DataFrame constructor not compatible with array-like classes that have a 'name' attribute](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61443)\n- [BUG: Confusing Behavior When Assigning DataFrame Columns Using omegaconf.ListConfig](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61439)\n- [BUG: Some ExtensionArrays can return 0-d Elements](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61433)\n- [BUG: Joining Pandas with Polars dataframe produces fuzzy errormessage](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61434)\n- [BUG: documented usage of of str.split(...).str.get fails on dtype large_string[pyarrow]](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61431)\n\nReport for more context:\n[Report](https://brytelite.github.io/BryteLite/supply-chain-report)\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nRecompile NumPy and Pandas with mismatched flags.\n\nThen run the If padding bits are not cleared correctly in C structs, or if a layout mismatch occurs due to vendor/flag drift, crashes or incorrect math results may emerge.\n\n`CFLAGS=\"-std=c23\" pip install numpy pandas --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir when #building`\n\n### Installed Versions\n\nNumPy latest 3.13 release, Pandas latest 3.13 release are suitable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/comments/2888706286","html_url":"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61443#issuecomment-2888706286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61443","id":2888706286,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAA0YD86sLiju","user":{"login":"iabhi4","id":61010675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDEwNjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61010675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4","html_url":"https://github.com/iabhi4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iabhi4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-18T02:00:55Z","updated_at":"2025-05-18T02:00:55Z","body":"> Thanks for the report [@user27182](https://github.com/user27182) and investigaiton [@iabhi4](https://github.com/iabhi4).
