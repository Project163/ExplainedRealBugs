In a future version, strings will be parsed as datetime strings, matching the behavior without a 'unit'. To retain the old behavior, explicitly cast ints or floats to numeric type before calling to_datetime.\r\nTimestamp('2024-01-07 20:39:28')\r\n\r\n>>> pd.to_datetime(1704660000, unit=\"s\", origin=\"unix\")\r\nTimestamp('2024-01-07 20:40:00')\n```\n\n\n### Issue Description\n\nIncorrect datetime object generated when unix timestamp is passed as string.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe timestamp string should be converted to the correct datetime regarless of the `dtype` of the input (`string` or `int`). Or, raise error if `string` inputs are illegal.\r\n\r\nThe current depracation warning seems to imply that the behaviour is working as expected now, but won't be available in future versions.\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n```\r\n[~] $ pip list | rg \"pandas|numpy\"\r\nnumpy                             1.26.1\r\npandas                            2.2.0\r\npandas-stubs                      2.1.4.231218\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"MarcoGorelli","id":33491632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDkxNjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33491632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli","html_url":"https://github.com/MarcoGorelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcoGorelli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57051/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57051/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
