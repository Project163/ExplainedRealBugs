If either endpoint is not in the index, then a keyerror should be returned?\r\n\r\nThere are, AFAICT, a number of problems with the logic here:\r\n```python\r\n        mask = np.array(True)\r\n        raise_mask = np.array(True)\r\n        if start is not None:\r\n            start_casted = self._maybe_cast_slice_bound(start, \"left\")\r\n            mask = start_casted <= self\r\n            raise_mask = start_casted == self\r\n\r\n        if end is not None:\r\n            end_casted = self._maybe_cast_slice_bound(end, \"right\")\r\n            mask = (self <= end_casted) & mask\r\n            raise_mask = (end_casted == self) | raise_mask\r\n\r\n        if not raise_mask.any():\r\n            raise KeyError(\r\n                \"Value based partial slicing on non-monotonic DatetimeIndexes \"\r\n                \"with non-existing keys is not allowed.\",\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's work through the possible cases:\r\n\r\n1. `start` is None, `end` is not None (and not in the index)\r\n    `raise_mask` is initialised to True, but True is not a neutral element for `|`, so if `start` is None, then `raise_mask` always evaluates to `True`, and its negation is `False`, so we don't raise.\r\n2. `start` is not None (and not in the index), `end` is None\r\n    `raise_mask` is all False, and its negation is `True` (so we raise).\r\n3. `start` is not None (and not in the index), `end` is not None (and not the index)\r\n    `raise_mask` is initialised to all False, and ored with another array that is all False, so its negation is True and we raise.\r\n4. `start` is not None (and not in the index), `end` is not None and _in_ the index\r\n    `raise_mask` is all False, is ored with an array with one True value, so `any` produces `True` and its negation is False, so we don't raise.\r\n5. `start` is not None (and _in_ the index), `end` is not None and _not_ in the index\r\n    `raise_mask` has at least one True entry, is ored with all False, so `any` produces `True`, so we don't raise.\r\n\r\nI think one should be checking that both the start and end points are in the index independently, perhaps like so:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py b/pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py\r\nindex 1500bcef5d..95a6e4a9a2 100644\r\n--- a/pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py\r\n+++ b/pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py\r\n@@ -666,18 +666,18 @@ class DatetimeIndex(DatetimeTimedeltaMixin):\r\n             return Index.slice_indexer(self, start, end, step)\r\n \r\n         mask = np.array(True)\r\n-        raise_mask = np.array(True)\r\n+        in_index = True\r\n         if start is not None:\r\n             start_casted = self._maybe_cast_slice_bound(start, \"left\")\r\n             mask = start_casted <= self\r\n-            raise_mask = start_casted == self\r\n+            in_index &= (start_casted == self).any()\r\n \r\n         if end is not None:\r\n             end_casted = self._maybe_cast_slice_bound(end, \"right\")\r\n             mask = (self <= end_casted) & mask\r\n-            raise_mask = (end_casted == self) | raise_mask\r\n+            in_index &= (end_casted == self).any()\r\n \r\n-        if not raise_mask.any():\r\n+        if not in_index:\r\n             raise KeyError(\r\n                 \"Value based partial slicing on non-monotonic DatetimeIndexes \"\r\n                 \"with non-existing keys is not allowed.\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis might, however, have some unintuitive-seeming behaviour. Since the right slice bound is cast \"up\", one needs to provide much more precision than it looks like to actually pull something out of the index:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(s)\r\n# 2001-01-01

Description\r\n\r\nFollowing on from #13534, this extends the scheme to handle label-based lookups as long as the index is not a multiindex.\r\n\r\nAs is the case for positional indexing, all of the different ways one can index a frame with labels eventually boil down to indexing by slice, boolean mask, map, or scalar in libcudf. `loc`-based keys are parsed into information that tags them by type. Since this information is the same as is used for `iloc` indexing, we can then dispatch to the same \"internal\" calls that don't do further bounds-checking or normalisation: rather than converting a label-based lookup to an argument we can pass to `iloc`-getitem (which must reinterpret it), we just take the decision straight away.\r\n\r\nThe next stage (which will help to remove a bunch of code) will be to handle multiindex keys, but that will be sufficiently complicated that I'd rather do it separately.\r\n\r\n- Closes #13014\r\n- Closes #13268 \r\n- Closes #13379 \r\n- Closes #13652\r\n- Closes #13653\r\n- Closes #13658 (or at least, maintains the correctness)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] I am familiar with the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] New or existing tests cover these changes.\r\n- [x] The documentation is up to date with these changes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13717/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9864225758,"node_id":"CE_lADOAA0YD85qeh7hzwAAAAJL9CPe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/events/9864225758","actor":{"login":"mroeschke","id":10647082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ3MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10647082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke","html_url":"https://github.com/mroeschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-07-19T15:41:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9864226746,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAA0YD85qeh7hzwAAAAJL9Ce6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/events/9864226746","actor":{"login":"mroeschke","id":10647082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ3MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10647082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke","html_url":"https://github.com/mroeschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0fff817aca15bbefccf6fa27bf13225db0ee6235","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/commits/0fff817aca15bbefccf6fa27bf13225db0ee6235","created_at":"2023-07-19T15:41:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
