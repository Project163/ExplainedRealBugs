If we want to change the behaviour we cannot doing it from pandas, that's why I;m requesting to include all these parameters as well not only the VBA.\n\n### Feature Description\n\nthe current definition on **_openpyxl.py** file is:  \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef load_workbook(\r\n        self, filepath_or_buffer: FilePath | ReadBuffer[bytes], engine_kwargs\r\n    ) -> Workbook:\r\n        from openpyxl import load_workbook\r\n\r\n        return load_workbook(\r\n            filepath_or_buffer,\r\n            read_only=True,\r\n            data_only=True,\r\n            keep_links=False,\r\n            **engine_kwargs,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n\r\nand it must be just 👍 \r\n`  def load_workbook(\r\n        self, filepath_or_buffer: FilePath | ReadBuffer[bytes], engine_kwargs\r\n    ) -> Workbook:\r\n        from openpyxl import load_workbook\r\n\r\n        return load_workbook(\r\n            filepath_or_buffer,\r\n            **engine_kwargs,\r\n        )`\n\n### Additional Context\n\nMany thanks for your support,","closed_by":{"login":"mroeschke","id":10647082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ3MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10647082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke","html_url":"https://github.com/mroeschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mroeschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/55027/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/55027/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
