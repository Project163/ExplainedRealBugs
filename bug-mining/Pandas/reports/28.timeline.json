The tick positions always start at 0 in the bar class\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/b5e62ef2dc5dfcc23df5cf8b9dfd65733d9c8886/pandas/plotting/_matplotlib/core.py#L1858\nwhile the tick positions in the line class are computed by a PeriodConverter used in matplotlib [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/v3.10.1/lib/matplotlib/units.py#L161). \n\nSince the xticks in the example above are not numeric (of type `pandas.Period`), matplotlib assigns the tick positions by itself: 0 maps onto 1970, so 2023-2025 map onto around 53-55. So the bar spans 0-2 and the line spans 53-55, i.e., they don't overlap the same x range. Then, the pandas plotting routine restricts the x range to the last plot range, which essentially crops out the first plot.\n\nThe current pandas plotting routine coincidentally works for string indices as, in such cases, matplotlib / the converter assigns tick positions starting at 0, as in `BarPlot`.\n\nI believe the most straightforward way to fix the issue is to change the tick positions in BarPlot to reflect how it's computed in PeriodConverter, as attempted in #61173 .\n\nPlease let me know if the approach sounds reasonable.\n\nNote that the same issue appears in the BoxPlot class, and possibly other ones, so there will change needed in that class in order to see line and box plots on the same plot.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/comments/2747516415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MartinBraquet","id":25173236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTczMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25173236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinBraquet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17156521000,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAA0YD86vMqhozwAAAAP-m7wo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/events/17156521000","actor":{"login":"MartinBraquet","id":25173236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTczMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25173236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinBraquet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"218871dd758518021a8ee5ff80ab6d0d14223583","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MartinBraquet/pandas/commits/218871dd758518021a8ee5ff80ab6d0d14223583","created_at":"2025-04-07T16:00:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/comments/2783943806","html_url":"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61161#issuecomment-2783943806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61161","id":2783943806,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAA0YD86l75x-","user":{"login":"MartinBraquet","id":25173236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTczMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25173236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinBraquet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-07T16:31:25Z","updated_at":"2025-04-07T16:31:25Z","body":"take","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/comments/2783943806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MartinBraquet","id":25173236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTczMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25173236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinBraquet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBraquet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBra
