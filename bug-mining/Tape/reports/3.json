This causes `QueueFile.expandIfNecessary` to never complete, it's basically adding the fileLength each time through.\n\nI propose we add an additional check on fileLength when we read it in `readHeader`.  If zero (and less than zero? java ints _are_ signed, after all) it would throw an IOException, failing fast.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dnkoutso","id":310370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDM3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/310370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso","html_url":"https://github.com/dnkoutso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkoutso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/tape/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/tape/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
