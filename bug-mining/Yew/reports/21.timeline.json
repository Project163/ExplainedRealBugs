👋 \r\nThank you for the issue and all the time you've spent looking into when this change occurred and sorry for the delay in response.\r\n\r\n> it would be useful to allow the relative behavior again as this would allow yew apps (with workers) to be dropped into a directory not at the root of a website\r\n\r\n> I think \"page origin + pathname\" has a valid usecase.\r\n\r\nAgreed, I think the use case you stated above shows perfectly why this would be the case. I'd like to see both approaches available for users.\r\n\r\n>  I would like to fix and I can work on a solution but this requires discussion\r\n\r\nI'm curious whether you had a possible solution in mind? \r\n\r\nHousekeeping: \r\nI'm going to remove the `bug` label and add a `feature-request` label.\r\n\r\n> One could potentially call this a regression but the behavior was purposefully changed in #1208 to fix #1175.\r\n\r\nAs you've stated the change was purposeful so `bug` doesn't seem correct to me, even though I agree that it actually results in more restrictive behaviour. I also think it's a feature request because, I think we agree that, just reverting the change isn't a \"fix\" and I think we can do something better :)\r\n\r\nIf you think this is wrong just let me know

This is a tracking issue for the upcoming `v0.19.0` release 🎉 \r\n\r\nThere are a number of things that I think _should_ be completed before release and some others that would be nice to see included but shouldn't prevent the release. None of this is set in stone and I welcome everyone to comment below whether you think something should be added or removed from either list!\r\n\r\n## Blocking (in no particular order):\r\n- [x] #2034\r\n- [x] #2035 (this issue exists in the `master` example too)\r\n- [x] #1946\r\n- [x] #1852 \r\n- [x] #1642 \r\n- [x] #2061\r\n- [x] #2056\r\n- [x] #2072\r\n- [x] #2116\r\n- [x] #2161\r\n- [x] #2168\r\n- [x] #2185\r\n\r\n## Notable but not blocking (in no particular order): \r\n- #1851 \r\n- #1844 \r\n- #1858 \r\n- #1860 \r\n- #1892 \r\n- #1891\r\n- #1853 \r\n- #1633 \r\n- #1609\r\n- #925\r\n- #2048\r\n- #2050\r\n\r\n## Issues that can be closed by new release\r\n- #1986 \r\n- #1985\r\n- #1045\r\n\r\nTwo of these issues are about services that are going to be removed, so can't be fixed, and one is a more general\r\ncritique of the router which has been re-written.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\nSome extra bits to do before the release:\r\n\r\n- [x] Review dependencies\r\n- [x] Review and list issues that are resolved by the new release (more of a note to self 💭)\r\n- [x] Confirm that each example is working correctly (the CI only checks if they compile) ( Tracking issue #2205 )\r\n- [x] Consider migration information and where it would live - yew.rs? as a discussion? ( PR #2210 )\r\n- [x] Update CHANGELOG ( Open PR #2199 )\r\n- [x] Add the new version and make it default in yew docs (No need to copy all files, just make it so that new version points to same things as \"next\") ( Open PR #2220 )\r\n\r\nExpect all sections to change - I will update it as we go

I agree with all you write.\r\n\r\nRegarding a proposed solution, how about adding the following method and default implementation to the `Agent` trait:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n\r\n/// Declares the behavior of the agent.\r\npub trait Agent: Sized + 'static {\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    fn resource_path_is_relative() -> bool {\r\n        false\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow setting an relative path if desired in the implementation of the trait, but would keep the current behavior as default.\r\n\r\nI haven't implemented this but it seems like it should work.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yewstack/yew/issues/comments/923791454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"astraw","id":30176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw","html_url":"https://github.com/astraw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astraw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yewstack/yew/issues/comments/925111216","html_url":"https://github.com/yewstack/yew/issues/2056#issuecomment-925111216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yewstack/yew/issues/2056","id":925111216,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtKdYc43JBOw","user":{"login":"mc1098","id":43726912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzI2OTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43726912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098","html_url":"https://github.com/mc1098","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc1098/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-22T16:58:27Z","updated_at":"2021-09-22T16:58:27Z","body":"I'm

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows a web worker resource (the `.js` and `_bg.wasm` files) to be specified relative to the loading path. Prior to this PR, the resource is specified with an absolute path. In this case - with an absolute path - if the resource is specified at `\"location.js\"`, the path `\"/location.js\"` will be used.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #2056, this adds a new method `name_of_resource_is_relative` to the trait `yew_agent::Agent`. The default implementation returns `false` and the current behavior - to specify an absolute path - remains unchanged. What is new here is that if an implementation implements this method and returns `true`, the location of a web worker script is interpreted as relative to the current path.\r\n\r\nFixes #2056.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `cargo make pr-flow`\r\n- [x] I have reviewed my own
