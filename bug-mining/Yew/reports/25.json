But `send_future_batch()` requires `Vec`. This feels like an unnecessary limitation, it should be able to use `SendAsMessage` as well so that way I can have a future that optionally sends a message.\r\n\r\nArguably `send_message_batch()` could take `SendAsMessage` as well for consistency, though it's less important there as I can simply choose to not send a message if I have `None`. If you add a `batch_callback_future()` (which seems like a missing hole right now) then that too should use `SendAsMessage`.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n - Yew version: 0.19.3\r\n\r\n**Questionnaire**\r\n<!-- Developing Yew is a community effort! -->\r\n<!-- If you feel up to the challenge, please check one of the boxes below: -->\r\n- [ ] I'm interested in fixing this myself but don't know where to start\r\n- [ ] I would like to fix and I have a solution\r\n- [X] I don't have time to fix this right now, but maybe later\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"siku2","id":16530283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTMwMjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16530283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2","html_url":"https://github.com/siku2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siku2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yewstack/yew/issues/2506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yewstack/yew/issues/2506/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
