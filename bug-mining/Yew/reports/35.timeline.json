Description\r\n\r\nFix conversion from IndexMap to IMap in IntoPropValue implementation\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an error in the IntoPropValue implementation for IndexMap to IMap conversion. The original code used `IMap::from(self)`, which failed because there's no direct `From` implementation for `IMap` from `indexmap::IndexMap`.\r\n\r\nChanges made:\r\n- Replace `IMap::from(self)` with `IMap::from_iter(self)`\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- `from_iter` utilizes the `FromIterator` trait to construct an `IMap` from an iterator.\r\n- `IndexMap` implements `IntoIterator`, allowing it to be used with `from_iter`.\r\n- This approach avoids the need for a direct `From` implementation between `IMap` and `IndexMap`.\r\n\r\nThe change resolves the compilation error and provides a more flexible conversion method using existing trait implementations.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis change may not directly resolve the Issue, but at least it resolved a similar error that was occurring in my environment\r\n\r\nI added yew to the dependencies package,\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nyew = { version = \"0.21\", features = [\"csr\"] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added yew to the dependencies package, and ran into the error in this Issue when I did a simple HTML build to see how it worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the code of main.rs at that time.\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nuse yew::prelude::*;\r\n\r\n#[function_component(App)]\r\nfn app() -> Html {\r\n    html! {\r\n        <h1>{ \"Hello World\" }</h1>\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    yew::Renderer::<App>::new().render(); }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\naddresses #3659 \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- For further details, please read CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed my own code\r\n- [ ] I have added tests\r\n  <!-- If this is a bug fix, these tests will fail if the bug is present (to stop it from cropping up again) -->\r\n  <!-- If this is a feature, my tests prove that the feature works -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yewstack/yew/issues/3677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yewstack/yew/issues/3677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yewstack/yew/issues/comments/2225621154","html_url":"https://github.com/yewstack/yew/issues/3659#issuecomment-2225621154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yewstack/yew/issues/3659","id":2225621154,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtKdYc6EqEii","user":{"login":"tsal","id":1747304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDczMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1747304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal","html_url":"https://github.com/tsal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-12T13:43:55Z","updated_at":"2024-07-12T13:43:55Z","body":"Please fix this.
