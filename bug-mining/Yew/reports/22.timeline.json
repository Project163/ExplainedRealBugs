This is a tracking issue for the upcoming `v0.19.0` release 🎉 \r\n\r\nThere are a number of things that I think _should_ be completed before release and some others that would be nice to see included

( PR #2210 )\r\n- [x] Update CHANGELOG ( Open PR #2199 )\r\n- [x] Add the new version and make it default in yew docs (No need to copy all files, just make it so that new version points to same things
