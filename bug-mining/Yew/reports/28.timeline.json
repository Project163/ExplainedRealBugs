Keep in mind, that this check was recently changed to a `debug_assert!` from a simple early return, because the krause's js-framework-benchmark has shown a performance regression. But that already renders 10k elements in a large list, which would be a strain in real apps, and doesn't hit the stack size limit. Are you doing something similar?\r\n\r\nRegardless, for the fix, either:\r\n- change it to an iterative instead of recursive check, but recurse on both sides of the equal sign, not just on the right... In this case, also change it for `NodeRef::get`, it suffers from a similar problem.\r\n- change the way we internally use `NodeRef` to a better data structure. Note though a [very similar performance comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fabef7a6b71798fe2477720e59d090a0e74e0009/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCommitWork.js#L1771-L1774) when comparing our \"linked list of siblings via NodeRefs\" to their searching procedure.

Description\r\n\r\nA new for-internal-use data structure, `DomPosition`, is introduced to replace the uses of `NodeRef`s. This means the user-facing `NodeRef` does no longer have a `link` to a potentially long chain to follow.\r\n\r\nA `DomPosition` can either point a `Node` (next sibling), `None` (the end of the children list), or a `RetargetableDomPosition`. The last of which is used to be able to transparently update the position \"before\" components, without having to explicitly know which kind of dom_bundle is its sibling.\r\n\r\nAlso introduces an explicit `next_sibling` for `Fragment`, to better track what comes after it during hydration.\r\n\r\nFixes #3043\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- For further details, please read CONTRIBUTING.md
