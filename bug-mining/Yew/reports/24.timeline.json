Per-job Caching\r\neach job now has its own cache keys.\r\nPreviously all jobs have the same cache. This is mad inefficient.\r\nCache from the nightly toolchain doesn't help at all in the same job with the stable toolchain for example.\r\n\r\nAlso added missing npm caching for website-related workflows.\r\n\r\n### stale cache invalidation\r\n\r\ncargo caches aggressively and leaves a lot of outdated dependencies in the cache.\r\n[cargo-sweep](https://github.com/holmgr/cargo-sweep) is introduced to detect and clean unvisited cache during each job.\r\nAlso added a manually-dispatchable weekly cron job to build the `cargo-sweep` binary and commit to the `ci/` directory.\r\n\r\n### Path Filtering Workflows\r\n\r\nTouching `website/**` now won't trigger irrelevant workspace tests.\r\n\r\n~~The same goes the other way around, touching other stuff won't trigger website workflows.~~\r\n\r\nedit: touching other stuff should trigger website tests because the snippets depend on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~~Combined Website building and publishing~~\r\n\r\n~~Previously two workflows were set up sequentially to do the building and publishing. The artifact download and upload can take a minute and a huge chunch of complex steps are dedicated to \r\nsetting variables and communicating between the two workflows. They are now combined with a `job:needs` key to preserve the sequential nature.~~\r\n\r\n\r\n### Remove check-examples job in the pull-request workflow\r\n\r\nIt is covered by a previous `clippy --all-targets` job and only increases build time\r\n\r\n### Extract cargo fmt job as workflow\r\n\r\nIt doesn't need any caching and can be completed concurrently as fast as possible instead of blocking the pull-request workflow.\r\n\r\n### Renaming\r\n\r\n`pull-request.yml` is renamed to `main-checks.yml`\r\n\r\n### un-exclude `tool/website-test`\r\n\r\nI can't figure out the reasoning for excluding the package in the workspace. It would complicate caching  setup so I included it and the tests pass smoothly locally. I'll see how it goes in the CI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes ~~#0000~~ complaints about slow CI speed\r\n\r\nCI is tricky to get right, I expect this PR to go through some painful followup edits
