Also, Cannot find name 'Node' can be resolved by adding the dom lib in the compiler options\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is most probably the wrong `Node`; the right one is https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/src/ast/nodes/shared/Node.ts.\r\n\r\nWill take a look at #1864 later. As for @guybedford's comment: When we did the conversion earlier, we never considered the types to be used publicly as this was not the problem we were trying to solve. Thus the few types that actually make sense to be used publicly are far too generic. See my comment here: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/1837#issuecomment-356523806\r\n\r\nBut I see the advantages of maintaining these option types in rollup itself as for TypeScript users, deprecations etc. will always be up to date with the rollup version they actually use.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I do not see I will find the time to wrap my head around improving this any time soon but if someone from the community feels up to this, please let me know! I will certainly try to support you with this!\r\n\r\nalso cc @alan-agius4
