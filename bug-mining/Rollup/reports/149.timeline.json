so initial poking did not reveal anything yet, but maybe we can find the culprit together. There is a special logic for SystemJS that eventually helps us to update exported variables in pattern assignments which is apparently faulty.\r\n\r\nBasically what this stack trace tells me that there is something that can legally be a part of array patterns that I overlooked (or are you using any special acorn plugins to allow advanced syntax?).\r\n\r\nMore precisely, the culprit appears to be something like\r\n\r\n```js\r\n([someVariable] = someOtherVariable);\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut with something substantially different inside the pattern on the left side that I apparently overlooked. It could also be nested:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsomeFunctionCall([someVariable] = someOtherVariable);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe if you search for something like `] = `, which should not be too common. What I need is the complete expression that contains the pattern assignment. To test if an expression is the problem, you should be able to just put comments around it and see if Rollup compiles. Maybe the expression appears multiple times? Unfortunately it is not possible to identify the position in the code where this happens without patching Rollup itself. If everything else fails, I could try to create such a patched version that should at least be able to give us the file where this happens and maybe the involved code.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/472744685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/472746466","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/2750#issuecomment-472746466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/2750","id":472746466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Mjc0NjQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-14T08:13:36Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T08:13:36Z","body":"Actually it was not too difficult to patch the code.
