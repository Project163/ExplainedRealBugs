In fact, maybe I meant for `quince` to refer to something else, from a different module or even a global.)\n\nAnd lastly in baz.js:\n\n``` js\nimport {quince} from \"./foo\";\nimport bar from \"./bar\";\n\nexport default function() {\n  bar();\n  console.log(\"baz\", quince);\n};\n```\n\nRolling up baz.js:\n\n``` js\n'use strict';\n\nvar quince = 42;\n\nvar foo = function() {\n  console.log(\"foo\");\n};\n\nvar bar = function() {\n  foo();\n  console.log(\"bar\", quince);\n};\n\nvar baz = function() {\n  bar();\n  console.log(\"baz\", quince);\n};\n\nmodule.exports = baz;\n```\n\nSo, now bar.js’s `quince` is referring to the one in foo.js—but only because it was imported by baz.js. It seems like since bar.js refers to the symbol `quince`, the symbol imported from foo.js should be renamed to prevent masking (like `foo_quince` or whatever… though of course then you have to make sure `foo_quince` isn’t referred to anywhere in the original code, too).\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
