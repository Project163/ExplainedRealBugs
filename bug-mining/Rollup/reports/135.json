Clone https://github.com/isidrok/react-bug\r\n1. `npm install` \r\n1. `npm start`\r\n1. Open `build.dev.js` and scroll to `diffProperties$1` function definition\r\n1. Open `node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js` for comparison and scroll to `diffProperties$1` function definition\r\n\r\nYou’ll see that the original function definition contains a `for` loop like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction diffProperties$1(domElement, tag, lastRawProps, nextRawProps, rootContainerElement) {\r\n  // ...\r\n  for (propKey in lastProps) {\r\n    if (nextProps.hasOwnProperty(propKey) || !lastProps.hasOwnProperty(propKey) || lastProps[propKey] == null) {\r\n      continue;\r\n    }\r\n    if (propKey === STYLE) {\r\n      // ...\r\n    } else if (propKey === DANGEROUSLY_SET_INNER_HTML || propKey === CHILDREN) {\r\n      // ...\r\n    } else if (registrationNameModules.hasOwnProperty(propKey)) {\r\n      // ...\r\n    } else {\r\n      // ...\r\n    }\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever the `diffProperties$1` definition in the Rollup’d `bundle.dev.js` is completely missing the (essential) logic under those conditions as well as conditions themselves, except for the last one. This produces code that behaves differently. Its `for` loop only contains the `registrationNameModules.hasOwnProperty(propKey)` check and not the preceding ones.\r\n\r\nI verified that downgrading to 0.58.x fixes it.","closed_by":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/2199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/2199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
