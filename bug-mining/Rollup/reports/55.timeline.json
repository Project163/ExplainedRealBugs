See https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Plugins under \"Creating plugins\". Something I've found interesting and helpful is to write a testing plugin with one of those methods given on that wiki page that simply `console.log()`s its arguments, and returns undefined. This (generally) won't affect Rollup's behavior, but it does let you see what path names etc. Rollup is looking at under the hood.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/189747471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Conduitry","id":16696352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk2MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16696352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry","html_url":"https://github.com/Conduitry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/190371128","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/532#issuecomment-190371128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/532","id":190371128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDM3MTEyOA==","user":{"login":"jolyndenning","id":5524384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjQzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5524384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning","html_url":"https://github.com/jolyndenning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-29T20:28:22Z","updated_at":"2016-02-29T20:28:22Z","body":"@Conduitry you are right that `path.resolve('main.css!css')` actually does not throw an error. But rollup still throws an error even when I declare `main.css!css` as an external. For example,\n\n``` js\n// rollup.config.js\nimport path from 'path';\n\nexport default {\n    entry: 'main.js',\n    dest: 'bundle.js',\n    external: [path.resolve('./main.css!css')],\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// main.js\nimport './main.css!css';\n```\n\n``` js\n// main.css\n.mycss_class {\n}\n```\n\nthrows the following error (with rollup@0.25.4):\n\n```\nError: Could not resolve ./main.css!css from /Users/joel/playground/test/main.js\n    at /Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/src/Bundle.js:186:42\n    at tryCatch (/Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/-internal.js:185:12)\n    at invokeCallback (/Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/-internal.js:197:13)\n    at publish (/Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/-internal.js:168:7)\n    at flush (/Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/asap.js:87:5)\n    at doNTCallback0 (node.js:407:9)\n    at process._tickCallback (node.js:336:13)\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:477:11)\n    at startup (node.js:117:18)\n    at node.js:951:3\n```\n\nHowever, if I rename the `main.css` file to be `main.css!css`, then no error is thrown. To me, this seems like something that should be taken care of inside of Rollup itself (as opposed to a rollup plugin), since Rollup already handles `externals`, without plugins. Also, as far as I can tell, #410, #418, and [the wiki](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/JavaScript-API#external) did not intentionally create this behavior where the relative file must exist, which might indicate that this was just an oversight?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/190371128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jolyndenning","id":5524384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjQzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5524384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning","html_url":"https://github.com/jolyndenning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":571775519,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTcxNzc1NTE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/571775519","actor":{"login":"Conduitry","id":16696352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk2MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16696352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry","html_url":"https://github.com/Conduitry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-29T20:28:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":571775520,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU3MTc3NTUyMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/571775520","actor":{"login":"Conduitry","id":16696352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk2MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16696352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry","html_url":"https://github.com/Conduitry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-29T20:28:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/192031422","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/532#issuecomment-192031422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/532","id":192031422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjAzMTQyMg==","user":{"login":"jolyndenning","id":5524384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjQzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5524384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning","html_url":"https://github.com/jolyndenning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"cre
