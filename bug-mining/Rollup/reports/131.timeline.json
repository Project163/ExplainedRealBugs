#1688 didn't completely solve the issue, as it still allows the alternate screen to be opened, which causes what _appears_ to be a screen reset (but is actually just the alternate buffer being super-imposed) regardless of `clearScreen` config.\r\n\r\nTo properly address this, you'd need to configure the alternate screen [here](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/d94db0f2ee23cc4a036c645b517b9dcb94659eb6/bin/src/run/watch.ts#L33), perhaps by adding a boolean parameter `clearScreen` and modifying [screen.reset](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/d94db0f2ee23cc4a036c645b517b9dcb94659eb6/bin/src/run/alternateScreen.ts#L32) to omit the special characters appropriately. The problem is, right now, the config isn't evaluated until after `start()` is called, which is wayyyyy after the `alternateScreen()` factory has been initialized (and `screen.open()` has been called).\r\n\r\nI think it's safe to require restarting the whole watcher process if you change those options in a config file that you'd normally expect to hot-reload. It's maddening otherwise, since several TTY-related options have already been essentially hard-coded during the initialization of the watcher parent process.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/354022896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"evocateur","id":5605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur","html_url":"https://github.com/evocateur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1401959202,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0MDE5NTkyMDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/1401959202","actor":{"login":"evocateur","id":5605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur","html_url":"https://github.com/evocateur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d18c3666df2963982b73efb34c6f01051f72a604","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/evocateur/rollup/commits/d18c3666df2963982b73efb34c6f01051f72a604","created_at":"2017-12-26T23:17:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/354024103","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/1804#issuecomment-354024103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1804","id":354024103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDAyNDEwMw==","user":{"login":"evocateur","id":5605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur","html_url":"https://github.com/evocateur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evocateur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-26T23:21:16Z","updated_at":"2017-12-26T23:21:16Z","body":"I started sketching out a fix, but I haven't had time to test it properly (still getting my TypeScript legs, too).
