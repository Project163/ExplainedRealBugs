a specific build I want to treat a (normal) (relative) import as an external resource. Given::\n\n```\nimport {throttle} from './Lib/decorators'\n\nthrottle(/* function */)...\n```\n\nI want a build roughly as follows::\n\n```\n(function(Lib_decorators){ ... }(Lib.decorators))\n```\n\nI first tried `resolveId` with something maybe naive like `if (importee.endsWith('Lib/decorators')) return false` b/c you say that returning a \"falsy value signals that importee should be treated as an external module and not included in the bundle\" (https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Plugins).\n\nBut that doesn't work at all; it throws `Could not resolve...` and aborts. Reading the source code https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/src/Bundle.js#L228-L254 hints me that I have to use `options.external` which is otherwise not pluggable instead. But then rollup treats `'./Lib/decorators'` and `../Lib/decorators` (and so on) as different modules. Output::\n\n```\n(function (__Lib_decorators,___Lib_decorators) {\n        'use strict';\n\n}(__Lib_decorators,___Lib_decorators));\n```\n\nFrom my perspective the codepath I linked to is already too complex and just open for bugs.\n\nThe best workaround I found is letting `resolveId` return a name e.g. `Lib.decorators`, then treating this name as external via `options.external`, lastly rename the wrongly normalized name `Lib_decorators` back to `Lib.decorators` via `options.globals`::\n\n```\nconst plugin = function() {\n  return {\n    resolveId(importee, importer) {\n      if (importee.endsWith('Lib/decorators')) return 'Lib.decorators'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport default {\n  format: 'iife',\n  external: function(id) {\n    if (id === 'Lib.decorators') return true\n  },\n  globals: function(id) {\n    if (id === 'Lib.decorators') return 'Lib.decorators'\n  },\n  plugins: [ plugin() ]\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/763/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
