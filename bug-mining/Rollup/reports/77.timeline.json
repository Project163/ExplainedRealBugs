It seems it's due to rollup asking the `UpdateExpression` (`++result`) whether it has effects. Rollup decides that it doesn't because it sees the declaration for `result` hasn't yet been activated, but that's only because it hasn't called `run` on `console.log(result)` yet. This is only an issue with top-level statements as this works fine:\n\n``` js\n{\nvar result = 0;\nif (!result) result++;\nconsole.log(result);\n}\n```\n\nIt seems to me either that `hasEffects` needs

There are basically two phases to the tree-shaking – a top-down phase (which uses `hasEffects`) and a bottom-up phase, which re-checks assignment/update/call expressions to see if they've changed their minds about whether or not they have effects now that we know more about the bundle (i.e. once we see the `console.log(result)` call and know that `result` is necessary).\n\nThe second phase repeats until no new previously unmarked code is marked for inclusion (I guess this is the 'shaking' part). Previously, Rollup just kept doing the top-down thing, which would mean walking the AST of every module. The bottom-up approach is intended to be more efficient. It just turns out it was missing the 'up' part of 'bottom-up' – the nearest statement would be marked, but parent statements (such as an if statement that didn't independently have effects that were already known, as in this case) would not be.\n\nFixed in 0.35.14.
