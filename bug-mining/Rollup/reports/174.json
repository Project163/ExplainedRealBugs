Rollup Version\r\n\r\n3.19.1\r\n\r\n### Operating System (or Browser)\r\n\r\nstackblitz\r\n\r\n### Node Version (if applicable)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Link To Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/rollup-repro-dju2ff?file=rollup.config.js\r\n\r\n### Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen calling `this.emitFile` with a same content but with different filename, rollup dedupes that and only outputs a single asset.\r\nBut because rollup always uses the filename used in the first call, the asset file name is non-deterministic when `this.emitFile` is called in parallel.\r\n\r\nFor example, Vite outputs CSS files by `this.emitFile` and uses the chunk name as a file name of the CSS file. `renderChunk` is called in parallel and when there's multiple CSS files containing the same content, the build becomes non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to fix this on rollup side as I guess this can happen by using rollup without Vite.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behaviour\r\n\r\nRollup outputs assets with deterministic file names.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is to sort all the file names and choose the first one.\r\n\r\nRelated:
