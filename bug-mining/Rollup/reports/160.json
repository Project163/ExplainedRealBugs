If i go deep starting to get dependency graph with `this.getModuleInfo` function - it returns only `importedIds`, which do not contain info about dynamic imports. It could be simplified to like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC ---> A --- dynamic ---> B\r\n       |\r\n       v\r\n       D\r\n```\r\nIn this case i will get C->A, A->D only.\r\n### Your Proposal for Changes\r\nInclude dynamicImportedIds to this.getModuleInfo? Or somehow to get this info from chunk if it was generated because it was imported by some other place?\r\n\r\nThank you","closed_by":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/3232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/3232/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
