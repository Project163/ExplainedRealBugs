However I hit a small bug while using it.\nWhen I use the following command to rollup.\n\n``` javascript\n$ rollup -i src/index.js -o newTest.js\nPromise is not defined\nReferenceError: Promise is not defined\n    at Object.write (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/rollup/Volumes/Storage/www/ROLLUP/rollup/src/rollup.js:53:12)\n    at /usr/local/lib/node_modules/rollup/bin/runRollup.js:110:18\n    at tryCatch (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/rollup/Volumes/Storage/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/-internal.js:182:12)\n    at invokeCallback (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/rollup/Volumes/Storage/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/-internal.js:194:13)\n    at publish (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/rollup/Volumes/Storage/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/-internal.js:164:16)\n    at flush (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/rollup/Volumes/Storage/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/asap.js:86:25)\n    at process._tickCallback (node.js:448:13)\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:499:11)\n    at startup (node.js:119:16)\n    at node.js:935:3\n```\n\nHowever if I use a slightly different format of command it does _rollup_ perfectly.\n\n``` javascript\n$ rollup --format umd  --name dq -- src/index.js > dq.js\n```\n\nThis might be a really small bug with the command line parameter. I just wanted you to be aware of this.\nAgain thank you for creating this tool.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
