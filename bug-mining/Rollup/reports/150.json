Rollup 1.4.0 and above removes comments from dynamic import statements. For example:\r\n\r\n```JS\r\nimport(/* webpackChunkName: \"chunk-name\" */ 'some-module')\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe comment will be removed in the bundle\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Issues without minimal reproductions will be closed! Please provide one by:\r\n  1. Using the REPL at https://rollupjs.org/repl, or\r\n  2. Work to isolate the problem and provide the exact steps in this issue, or\r\n  3. Provide a minimal repository link (Read https://git.io/fNzHA for instructions).\r\n     These may take more time to triage than the other options.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nComments within the dynamic import should not be removed in the bundle.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nComments are being removed within the dynamic module import.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Most issues can be expressed or demonstrated through the REPL or a repository.\r\n  However, the situation may arise where some small code snippets also need to\r\n  be provided.
