the case:\n- `a.js` depends on `./b.js`\n- `a.js` depends on `jquery`\n\n`resolveId` will provide the resolutions:\n- `./b.js` -> `b.js`\n- `jquery` -> `npm:jquery@2.1.4/dist/jquery.js`\n\n`externals` is set to the list `['npm:jquery@2.1.4/dist/jquery.js']`.\n\nThe expected behaviour is that since `jquery` is resolved into `npm:jquery@2.1.4/dist/jquery.js` which is provided as an external, that this module would not be loaded and would inline into the build as an import to its resolved name of `npm:jquery@2.1.4/dist/jquery.js`.\n\nThe actual behaviour is that the built file contains a reference to `jquery`, the unresolved external.\n\nApart from that everything else is working correctly.\n\nThe idea is to provide a way to control resolution of externals in the built file. Perhaps another mechanism may be suitable for this though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/424/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/185509444","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/410#issuecomment-185509444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/410","id":185509444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTUwOTQ0NA==","user":{"login":"jolyndenning","id":5524384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjQzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5524384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning","html_url":"https://github.com/jolyndenning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T02:09:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T18:53:16Z","body":"I've just been poring through the code and I'm not sure if I am missing something or if even after @Victorystick's pull request, rollup errors out because it's trying to resolve a relative import that I have specifically declared to be external. Below is a self contained example (I'm running rollup 0.25.4):\n\n```\n// rollup.config.js\nexport default {\n    entry: 'src.js',\n    dest: 'bundle.js',\n    external: ['./dep.js'],\n}\n```\n\n```\n// src.js\nimport dep from './dep.js';\n\nconsole.log(dep)\n```\n\n```\n// dep.js\nexport default 1;\n```\n\nMy expected result is that bundle.js would have an `import` statement for `./dep.js` still. But my actual result is the following error:\n\n```\nError: Could not resolve ./dep.js from /Users/joel/playground/test/src.js\n    at /Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/src/Bundle.js:186:42\n    at tryCatch (/Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/-internal.js:185:12)\n    at invokeCallback (/Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/-internal.js:197:13)\n    at publish (/Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/-internal.js:168:7)\n    at flush (/Users/joel/playground/test/node_modules/rollup/www/ROLLUP/rollup/node_modules/es6-promise/lib/es6-promise/asap.js:87:5)\n    at doNTCallback0 (node.js:407:9)\n    at process._tickCallback (node.js:336:13)\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:477:11)\n    at startup (node.js:117:18)\n    at node.js:951:3\n```\n\nI am certain that all of my file paths are correct because if I comment out the `external` property, the bundle succeeds in putting `dep.js` into the bundle. I think that it has something to do with the [resolveId](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/src/Bundle.js#L33-L37) function because it [resolves `false`](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/src/Bundle.js#L34) when `./dep.js` is in the `this.externals` array, which then [fails the check](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/src/Bundle.js#L182) to determine if the module should be forced to be external.\n\nAm I misunderstanding what @guybedford was going for with this issue or what @Victorystick was trying to do with the pull request? If so, would be happy to know why, and if not I'm happy to submit a pull request to fix it.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/185509444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jolyndenning","id":5524384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjQzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5524384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning","html_url":"https://github.com/jolyndenning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":554494286,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTU0NDk0Mjg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/554494286","actor":{"login":"Victorystick","id":703602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzYwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick","html_url":"https://github.com/Victorystick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-18T02:09:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":554494287,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU1NDQ5NDI4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/554494287","actor":{"login":"Victorystick","id":703602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzYwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick","html_url":"https://github.com/Victorystick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-18T02:09:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":554494288,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTU0NDk0Mjg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/554494288","actor":{"login":"guybedford","id":598730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODczMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford","html_url":"https://github.com/guybedford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-18T02:09:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null
