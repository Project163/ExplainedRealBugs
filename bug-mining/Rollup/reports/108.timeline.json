will resolve #1589 and #1592.\r\n\r\nFor #1589: In Identifier.js, I assumed that all declarations have assignedExpressions, which is certainly not true for SyntheticNamespaceDeclarations. To be cautious, for now we assume that those always have effects when mutated.\r\n\r\nFor #1592: It seems that people are calling getters for side-effects and this is something that rollup is not (and was never) prepared for yet. The better solution, as suggested by @kzc , is probably to start adding flags for certain more aggressive aspects of tree-shaking such as assuming that all getters are pure. Until then with this PR, rollup will keep all expression statements that are not usually called as statements because we assume that they are called for side-effects.

I could not install the PR code using `\"rollup\": \"rollup/rollup#pull/1591/head\"`: every time I try to install it, I get an error (e.g. `error: pathspec 'pull/1591/head' did not match any file(s) known to git.`).\r\n\r\nNot luck using the commit SHA either (e.g. `rollup/rollup#d011c0397e6a0914887e314ae8afb7d05a1f7c1b` => `fatal: reference is not a tree: d011c0397e6a0914887e314ae8afb7d05a1f7c1b`).\r\n\r\nIs `npm` broken (I'm using version 5.3.0)? I ended up by replicating your patch to the `rollup.js` files in the `node_modules/rollup/dist` folder... and it fixed the current issue! 🙌
