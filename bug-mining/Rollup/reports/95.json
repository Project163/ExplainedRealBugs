To help us help you, if you've found a bug please consider the following:\r\n\r\n* If you can demonstrate the bug using the interactive http://rollupjs.org demo, please do.\r\n* If that's not possible, perhaps because your bug involves plugins, we recommend creating a small repo that illustrates the problem.\r\n\r\nReproductions should be small, self-contained, correct examples – http://sscce.org. For example, if your bug isn't related to Gulp, **do not include Gulp in the repro**. (Side-note: if it *is* related to Gulp, this is the wrong issue tracker!) If possible, use a config file as it's the standard, favoured approach to using Rollup: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Command-Line-Interface#using-a-config-file\r\n\r\nOccasionally, this won't be possible, and that's fine – we still appreciate you raising the issue. But please understand that Rollup is run by unpaid volunteers in their free time, and we will prioritise bugs that follow these instructions.\r\n\r\nIf you have a stack trace to include, we recommend putting inside a `<details>` block for the sake of the thread's readability:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Stack trace</summary>\r\n\r\n  Stack trace goes here...\r\n</details>\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTL;DR: This construct causes a `operators[this.operator] is not a function`: minInt24x: - (2 ** 23)\r\n\r\nDetails: Place this in the main.js in the repl:\r\n```\r\nconst foo = {\r\n  minInt24: 0 - (2 ** 23),\r\n  // minInt24x: - (2 ** 23) // rollup bug operators[this.operator] is not a function\r\n}\r\nexport default foo\r\n```\r\nThen remove the comment.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
