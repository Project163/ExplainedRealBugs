The same runtime TpyeError also occurs when a file that starts with `(` or `[` is concatenated after a file that does not uses semi colons.\n\nA workaround could be to write a plugin that checks the first char of each file, and if it is a (square) bracket, adds a semi colon before. Or apply a strategy that always adds a semicolon between files (since empty instructions are allowed in js), even though the generated code would be less elegant.\n\nWhatever the solution, I believe it would be better to solve it in Rollup's core instead of a plugin.\n\nNote that I am not trying to argue whether not using semicolons is a bad thing.

guys,\n\nFirst I'd like to thank everybody for their input on this project. I really like the simplicity it brings our projects.\n\nWe noticed a small 'issue' when using default exports that are unnamed. The function declaration turns into a var declaration, but rollup doesn't add a trailing semicolon to this function. Our JSHint gives us a warning on this and breaks our build process.\n\nWhat is your take on this? Issue or not?\n\nUse the following setup to reproduce this on rollupjs.org:\n\n_main.js (entry module)_\n\n``` js\nimport customName from './no-name-default-export.js';\ncustomName( 'Hello moon!' );\n```\n\n_no-name-default-export.js_\n\n``` js\nexport default function(msg) {\n  console.log(msg);\n}\n\n```\n\n<!--\nThanks for raising an issue! To help us help you, if you've found a bug please consider the following:\n\n* If you can demonstrate the bug using the interactive http://rollupjs.org demo, please do.\n* If that's not possible, perhaps because your bug involves plugins, we recommend creating a small repo that illustrates the problem.\n\nReproductions should be small, self-contained, correct examples – http://sscce.org. For example, if your bug isn't related to Gulp, **do not include Gulp in the repro**. (Side-note: if it *is* related to Gulp, this is the wrong issue tracker!) If possible, use a config file as it's the standard, favoured approach to using Rollup: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Command-Line-Interface#using-a-config-file\n\nOccasionally, this won't be possible, and that's fine – we still appreciate you raising the issue. But please understand that Rollup is run by unpaid volunteers in their free time, and we will prioritise bugs that follow these instructions.\n\nIf you have a stack trace to include, we recommend putting inside a `<details>` block for the sake of the thread's readability:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Stack trace</summary>\n\n  Stack trace goes
