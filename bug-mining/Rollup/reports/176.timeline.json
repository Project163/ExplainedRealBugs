project using the official website method 'npm create vue@latest' and then introducing element-plus. This project cannot be built successfully.\nIf \"Link To Reproduction\" cannot be opened, you can run npm create vue@latest by yourself and then import element-plus.\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\n    OS: Windows 11 10.0.26100\n    CPU: (12) x64 AMD Ryzen 5 7500F 6-Core Processor             \n    Memory: 18.66 GB / 31.60 GB\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 22.13.1 - D:\\node\\node.EXE\n    npm: 10.9.2 - D:\\node\\npm.CMD\n  Browsers:\n    Edge: Chromium (131.0.2903.112)\n  npmPackages:\n    @vitejs/plugin-legacy: 6.0.0 => 6.0.0\n    @vitejs/plugin-vue: 5.2.1 => 5.2.1\n    vite: 6.0.11 => 6.0.11\n```\n\n### Used Package Manager\n\nnpm\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### Validations\n\n- [x] Follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [x] Read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- [x] Read the [docs](https://vite.dev/guide).\n- [x] Check that there isn't [already an issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues) that reports the same bug to avoid creating a duplicate.\n- [x] Make sure this is a Vite issue and not a framework-specific issue. For example, if it's a Vue SFC related bug, it should likely be reported to [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core) instead.\n- [x] Check that this is a concrete bug.

Removing the restriction `!argument.included` seems to fix it https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/0f20524ad9ecd166a900d43af93f05a3405d2a45/src/ast/scopes/ParameterScope.ts#L100 However, I'm not sure if it's the best solution. Currently, the bug occurs because the test node of a conditional expression cannot be re-included after the deoptimize cache happens. By the way, I haven't been able to create a minimal reproduction case yet.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/2630177544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TrickyPi","id":33021497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDIxNDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33021497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi","html_url":"https://github.com/TrickyPi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrickyPi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16157277020,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAh_Tpc6obzx_zwAAAAPDDHtc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/16157277020","actor":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-03T07:35:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16157277032,"node_id":"SE_lADOAh_Tpc6obzx_zwAAAAPDDHto","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/16157277032","actor":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-03T07:35:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/2630352154","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5823#issuecomment-2630352154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/5823","id":2630352154,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAh_Tpc6cx_0a","user":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false

the end, I just included your fix. You are right, even if an argument is already included it needs to be included again on every pass because that is basically one contract in rollup that \"every included node gets another `include` call on every subsequent tree-shaking pass\". If we do not re-include, then this contract is violated for arguments in some cases.
