Involves a little bit of dancing around, but I think it's the best solution. Hopefully I didn't introduce any bugs in the process.\n\nHere’s my entry file I’m trying to rollup:\n\n``` js\nexport {\n  event,\n  select,\n  selectAll\n} from \"d3-selection\";\n```\n\nThe resulting code looks like this:\n\n``` js\n// initialization of event is incorrectly renamed “event$1”\nexports.event$1 = null;\n\n// likewise with assignment\nfunction example(foo) {\n  exports.event$1 = foo;\n}\n\n// then the initial value is copied into the exports object under the correct name\nexports.event = exports.event$1;\n```\n\nSo, two problems:\n- There’s an undesired export “event$1” which has the correct value.\n- The desired export “event” is always null.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
