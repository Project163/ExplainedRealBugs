The new logic now only fixes the name when doing the first round of finalizations before `renderStart`, which should be good enough. Assets emitted at a later stage will still follow a \"first assets determines the name\" strategy. This guarantees, that `this.getFileName` will always return a correct and reliable name that does not change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/4919/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/4919/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"peterpeterparker","id":16886711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2NzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker","html_url":"https://github.com/peterpeterparker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterpeterparker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-25T08:10:01Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T08:10:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/nns-dapp/issues/2574","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/nns-dapp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/nns-dapp/issues/2574/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/nns-dapp/issues/2574/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/nns-dapp/issues/2574/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/2574","id":1725311023,"node_id":"PR_kwDOFKr7ac5RUVph","number":2574,"title":"Bump
