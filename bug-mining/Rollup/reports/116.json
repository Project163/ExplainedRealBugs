It's possible to have anonymous default function/class definitions that do not match that pattern, and so `.match` returns null, and subscripting that throws an exception.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced with a default anonymous export of an async function, or by inserting a comment between two of the keywords in the definition.\r\n\r\nAsync functions would probably be able to be handled by extending the regular expression - but that doesn't sound like a good idea for dealing with comments. My feeling is that it would be better to be looking at the AST here rather than the string, but I haven't looked into this much.","closed_by":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1798/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
