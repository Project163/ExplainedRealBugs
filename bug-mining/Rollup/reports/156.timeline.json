Rollup Version: v1.18.0\r\n- Operating System (or Browser): Linux 4.19.0-5-amd64\r\n- Node Version: v10.15.2\r\n\r\n### How Do We Reproduce?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst local = {\r\n\tprop: false,\r\n\tmeth (x) {\r\n\t\tthis.prop = x;\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const meth = (x) => {\r\n\tlocal.meth(x);\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const test = () => {\r\n\tif (local.prop === true) { // this is not constant\r\n\t\tconsole.log('true'); // this should remain\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe condition should remain since the value of `prop` can be modified from outside of the module.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe condition is removed.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nSome things that avoid this behaviour:\r\n\r\n- Setting `prop` value using the object name `local` instead of `this`.\r\n- Exporting the whole `local` object instead of wrapping the method.\r\n- Using a variable in the module context for the condition.\r\n\r\nSeems to depend on two things: determining object property mutability through more than one layer of function calls combined with the use of the `this` keyword and non-equivalence with any named references to the object.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/3027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/3027/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/520145519","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/2345#issuecomment-520145519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/2345","id":520145519,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDE0NTUxOQ==","user":{"login":"shellscape","id":76371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape","html_url":"https://github.com/shellscape","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shellscape/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-10T12:35:00Z","updated_at":"2019-08-10T12:35:00Z","body":"@lukastaegert
