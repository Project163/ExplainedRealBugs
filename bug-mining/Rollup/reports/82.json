I researched how `export *` should behave, and everwhere I looked it was treated as if it should only export named files, including transpilers like babel (see how they ignore default exports on purpose when converting ExportAllDeclaration [here](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs/src/index.js#L36)).\n\nRollup seems to always include the default export with `export *` though. I used the demo page to build an example [here](http://rollupjs.org/?version=0.36.1&shareable=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). Note how there's no build error, even though **file2.js** has no default export. If you remove the default export from **file1.js** you'll see the build fail though.\n\nI think it's important that Rollup behave in the expected way regarding these exports. If I keep the `export default` line in my file I get these annoying warnings on Rollup, and if I remove it the code may not work on other transpilers anymore. \n\n<!--\nThanks for raising an issue! To help us help you, if you've found a bug please consider the following:\n\n* If you can demonstrate the bug using the interactive http://rollupjs.org demo, please do.\n* If that's not possible, perhaps because your bug involves plugins, we recommend creating a small repo that illustrates the problem.\n\nReproductions should be small, self-contained, correct examples – http://sscce.org. For example, if your bug isn't related to Gulp, **do not include Gulp in the repro**. (Side-note: if it *is* related to Gulp, this is the wrong issue tracker!) If possible, use a config file as it's the standard, favoured approach to using Rollup: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Command-Line-Interface#using-a-config-file\n\nOccasionally, this won't be possible, and that's fine – we still appreciate you raising the issue. But please understand that Rollup is run by unpaid volunteers in their free time, and we will prioritise bugs that follow these instructions.\n\nIf you have a stack trace to include, we recommend putting inside a `<details>` block for the sake of the thread's readability:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Stack trace</summary>\n\n  Stack trace goes here...\n</details>\n-->\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1028/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
