is a potential fix for #34. It simply sorts statements within a bundle according to their original order with a module. It feels like a filthy hack though, so I'm just going to leave it here and not merge until alternatives have been explored.\n\nIn particular, a hypothetical bundle that looked like this...\n\n``` js\n[\n  { module: 'a', index: 1 },\n  { module: 'b', index: 1 },\n  { module: 'b', index: 0 },\n  { module: 'a', index: 0 }\n]\n```\n\n...wouldn't be sorted in such a way that the first in the list appeared after the last in the list.
