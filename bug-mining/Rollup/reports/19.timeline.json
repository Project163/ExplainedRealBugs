thrown together a quick repository to show the issue I'm seeing:\n[https://github.com/timshannon/rollup-ractive-issue](https://github.com/timshannon/rollup-ractive-issue)\n\nAs you can see from the repository, I'm using gobble to first build a ractive component into an es6 module, which I can then import into my main application file, and use Rollup to pull it all together into one JS file.\n\nFor the most part this works great until I try to take advantage of the import side effects as described in #13.  I can't seem to get Rollup to include any libraries imported in a Ractive component.\n\nIn the repository example above the component looks like this:\n\n```\n<div>\n    component\n</div>\n<script>\nimport \"../lib/standalone\";\n\ncomponent.exports = {\n};\n\n</script>\n```\n\nwith the `../lib/standalone` simply being an `alert(\"test\");`\n\nSo if the entirety of my unnamed import is loaded with the component, then you should get an alert pop up when running `gobble`.  But if you check the built source, the alert is nowhere to be found.\n\nLooking at the post ractive-component source, it looks correct to me.  And if I import the `standalone.js` in the main application file `index.js` the alert shows up / is imported fine.\n\nI'm probably missing something obvious, so this may be more of a question than an issue.\n\nThanks,\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
