https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/770\n\nWas understanding about the setting to `undefined`. Does this happen when passing in a global scope or does it preserve `this`. The spec specifies a global object (no matter what) in the following link. Should we be congruent with it?  I do realize that the side effect of the environment is irrelevant to rollup/buble.  Should there be a default we should implement around the spec?\n\nhttps://es5.github.io/#x15.1\n\nWas getting the following message when rolling up. I don't think i mind the override to `undefined`. But feel could cause some nasty bugs. Am I overlooking something? \n\nLastly the other day when doing the PR to upgrade to ASYNC-AWAIT I noticed there was some `undefined` being set in Acorn and it was complaining. Wonder if any relevance.
