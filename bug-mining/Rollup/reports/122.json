As a rollup user, I have to disable `sourcemap` option in rollup configuration, and for each plugins:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst babel = require('rollup-plugin-babel');\r\nconst commonjs = require('rollup-plugin-commonjs');\r\nconst nodeResolve = require('rollup-plugin-node-resolve');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  input: './src/index.js',\r\n\r\n  output: {\r\n    file: './dist/bundle.js',\r\n    sourcemap: false,\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    nodeResolve(),\r\n\r\n    babel({\r\n      sourceMap: false,\r\n    }),\r\n\r\n    commonjs({\r\n      sourceMap: false,\r\n    }),\r\n  ],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of plugins that need the `sourcemap` configuration: plugins that implement the `transform` and/or the `transformBundle` function.\r\n\r\n@Rich-Harris Not sure what is the best way to implement it, but I would be happy to send a pull request if you have an idea.","closed_by":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1583/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1583/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
