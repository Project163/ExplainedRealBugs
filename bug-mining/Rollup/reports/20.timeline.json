That should give you what you need to detect whether a given bundle is affected by a given file change.\n\n(A simpler option would be to just pass through the internal `modules` array, but I'm against that because a) it exposes Rollup's innards, allowing people to use undocumented stuff that's likely to change in future, b) ideally `modules` should be serializable with `JSON.stringify` so that it can be dumped to disk for incremental rebuild purposes, and c) it introduces mutation-related bugs as something we'd need to worry about.)\n\nHow does that sound?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/142162331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":415440477,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxNTQ0MDQ3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/415440477","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ac6c2d03db179036905843bdd7851c445f26b83f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/commits/ac6c2d03db179036905843bdd7851c445f26b83f","created_at":"2015-09-22T02:40:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-22T02:42:06Z","updated_at":"2015-09-22T02:42:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/129","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/129/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/129/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/129/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/129","id":107635551,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDU2MjIzNTY=","number":129,"title":"add

\nA rough first draft of what I've used this for :)\nhttps://github.com/ty1824/project-rollup\n\nGulp-compatible (support for streams) \"incremental\" builds. Allows a user to specify a list of target paths or a file containing a list of target paths, then uses rollup to bundle them - either by building all (.build) or by handling changes to files and building only the affected targets (.change)\n\nIt's not fully incremental, I rebundle/regenerate everything related to each target when that target is built, but it allows tracking changes so only changed targets are rebundled.\n\nHaving a bundle.rebundle() method might be useful, could store the bundles and then rebundle them with only the changed files :)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/144188586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ty1824","id":1669026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjkwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1669026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824","html_url":"https://github.com/ty1824","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ty1824/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":422377776,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIyMzc3Nzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/422377776","actor":{"login":"Victorystick","id":703602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzYwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick","html_url":"https://github.com/Victorystick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-29T20:54:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":422377777,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMjM3Nzc3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/422377777","actor":{"login":"Victorystick","id":703602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzYwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick","html_url":"https://github.com/Victorystick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victorystick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-29T20:54:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
