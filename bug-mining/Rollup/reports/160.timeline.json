There will be no warning yet but using the option will throw when using the `strictDeprecations` option. With the next major, a warning will be shown for all users.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this will add `dynamicallyImportedIds` to the object returned by `this.getModuleInfo`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this fixes an issue where `.js` extensions were also stripped from dynamic imports in AMD modules if the user supplied a custom string that happened to have a `.js` extension.\r\n\r\nInternally, this removes the `defaultPlugin` entirely and replaces it with custom code in the places where the hooks are triggered. This solves some type issues (i.e. the defaults provided by the default plugin were not respected in the return type of running the hook) and also makes sure that errors in the default handlers are not confusingly reported as belonging to some `Rollup Core` plugin.\r\n\r\nFrom the added documentation:\r\n\r\n#### `renderDynamicImport`\r\nType: `({format: string, moduleId: string, targetModuleId: string | null, customResolution: string | null}) => {left: string, right: string} | null`<br>\r\nKind: `sync, first`<br>\r\n\r\nThis hook provides fine-grained control over how dynamic imports are rendered by providing replacements for the code to the left (`import(`) and right (`)`) of the argument of the import expression. Returning `null` defers to other hooks of this type and ultimately renders a format-specific default.\r\n\r\n`format` is the rendered output format, `moduleId` the id of the module performing the dynamic import. If the import could be resolved to an internal or external id, then `targetModuleId` will be set to this id, otherwise it will be `null`. If the dynamic import contained a non-string expression that was resolved by a resolveDynamicImport hook to a replacement string, then `customResolution` will contain that string.\r\n\r\nThe following code will replace all dynamic imports with a custom handler, adding `import.meta.url` as a second argument to allow the handler to resolve relative imports correctly:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// plugin\r\nconst plugin = {\r\n  name: 'dynamic-import-polyfill',\r\n  renderDynamicImport() {\r\n    return {\r\n      left: 'dynamicImportPolyfill(',\r\n      right: ', import.meta.url)'\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\n// input\r\nimport('./lib.js');\r\n\r\n// output\r\ndynamicImportPolyfill('./lib.js', import.meta.url);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe next plugin will make sure all dynamic imports of `esm-lib` are marked as external and retained as import expressions to e.g. allow a CommonJS build to import an ES module in Node 13+, cf. how to [import ES modules from CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_import_expressions) in the Node documentation.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// plugin\r\nconst plugin = {\r\n  name: 'retain-import-expression',\r\n  resolveDynamicImport(specifier) {\r\n    if (specifier === 'esm-lib') return false;\r\n    return null;\r\n  },\r\n  renderDynamicImport({targetModuleId}) {\r\n    if (targetModuleId === 'esm-lib')\r\n    return {\r\n      left: 'import(',\r\n      right: ')'\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/3449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/3449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/601589742","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3232#issuecomment-601589742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/3232","id":601589742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTU4OTc0Mg==","user":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-20T08:43:49Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T08:43:49Z","body":"What timing...

Feature Use Case\r\n\r\nThis is followup of #3232 \r\n\r\nIn plugin i want to report actual source sizes after transformation and most important treeshake. Also it is not only about size only. I mean that returning number is not enough, because it would be great to report gzip size, which is required to read source as is.\r\n\r\n### Feature Proposal\r\n\r\nThere are 2 possible ways to add getter/function to get source (`renderedSource`):\r\n1. From bundle.modules object entry\r\n2. From `this.getModuleInfo` result\r\n\r\nThank you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/3458/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/3458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3160229274,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE2MDIyOTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/3160229274","actor":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-24T15:34:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3160229482,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMxNjAyMjk0ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/3160229482","actor":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"28ffcf4c4a2ab4323091f63944b2a609b7bcd701","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/commits/28ffcf4c4a2ab4323091f63944b2a609b7bcd701","created_at":"2020-03-24T15:34:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
