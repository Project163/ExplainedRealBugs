However, as far as I can tell, that approach for skipping relative files will only work if the file exists (otherwise `path.resolve` will fail inside of the rollup configuration).\n\nThe use case for skipping a relative import without there being a file of the same name is for bundling projects that will later be `System.import`ed (using SystemJS). The reason why the import does not match the relative filename exactly is because the project specifies which SystemJS plugin to use when loading the relative import. For example, my file tree may look like this:\n\n```\nsrc\n-->main.js\n-->main.css\n```\n\nwhere main.js is\n\n```\nimport './main.css!cssmodules';\n...\n```\n\nIs there a way I am unware of that allows for you to skip `./main.css!cssmodules` when the filename is really just `./main.css`??\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/532/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
