something is impossible does not make it impossible 😜.\r\n\r\nThis refactors and improves the if statement logic so that\r\n* The `test`, `consequent` and `alternate` branches are now included separately and only if both there is a chance the code is actually executed and they have side-effects\r\n* `alternate` branches that are not included are always completely removed instead of sometimes leaving an empty block\r\n* `consequent` branches that are not included but are necessary for rendering because the `test` is included are replaced by an empty block `{}` (I also could have gone for an empty statement `;` but this irrationally felt somewhat safer)\r\n\r\nAs this is essentially a bug fix for #2134, I branched this off the latest patch release so this can again be released as a patch
