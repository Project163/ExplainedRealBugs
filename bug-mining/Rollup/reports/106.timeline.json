I see what's going on here. [This code](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/ad4ca750a59be6a710d322b9a7372dc631907c6a/src/ast/nodes/shared/isUsedByBundle.js), which determines whether the left-hand side of an assignment expression (or argument of an update expression) is used by the bundle, is bad. Regardless of whether the assignment is a true assignment (`foo = x`) or a mutation (`foo.bar = x`), it looks for the root of the expression (`foo`) and determines whether it could be used.\n\nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup/commit/94536ca2adfb017d4a74a51fade39d0a0282203a fixes it, but in a bad way – if it's a mutation, we try to figure out what the object being mutated is, and if we can't, assume the worst. That means that `unused.a = b` isn't included, but `Unused.prototype.toString = ...` _is_, incorrectly, because Rollup isn't (yet) smart enough to know what the value of `Unused.prototype` is, or (more relevantly) that it only 'belongs' to `Unused`.\n\nTrying to think about the best way to think about this problem in a way that guarantees correctness but without being unduly conservative about effects. I think some concept of property 'ownership' might be the way forward (i.e. `V6Engine.prototype` could belong to either `V8Engine` or `V6Engine` because of `V6Engine.prototype = V8Engine.prototype`, so any mutations of that object are considered to have effects if _either_ `V8Engine` or `V6Engine` is included.
