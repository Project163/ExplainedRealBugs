As for licenses and dependencies, this is a nice tool: https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/browserify-fs\r\n\r\nLooks like including `buffer-es6` and `process-es6` should be no-brainers though technically if we bundle them, we should make sure there licenses are reflected in our license (I guess we should do this for Rollup as well, I do not have too much experience with this to be honest. But most of these licenses require you to distribute a copy of the license together with the source code in some form.)\r\n\r\nI am a little cautious about the browserify shims, they seem to have TONS of dependencies, some with questionable licenses. One could definitely experiment with bundling, an alternative could be not NOT make them a dependency but instead tell the user that they need to install this dependency if they enable that shim. Then we could try to do a dynamic import and if it fails, tell the user what they need to

Please consider supporting our collective:\r\n  👉 https://opencollective.com/rollup/donate\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Feature Use Case\r\n\r\nCurrently rollup acts as an advanced bundler(static + npm import resolver across multiple files, treeshaking, sourcemaps) and module formatter/transpiler(cjs <-> amd <-> iife etc), it also serves a very nice plugin system. Recently it seems `experimentalPreserveModules` became stable, however it misses preserving modules on a single file bundles(`[dir | file ] -> bundle.js`), in fact currently rollup throws an error if `preserveModules` gets used without a `dir` configuration or used with `file` configuration. \r\n\r\nI think this is an important feature that opens up new possibilities for rollup(for example, it can allow rollup to be the default `packager` for the next generation ember-cli) and most work seems to be already done. When a user selects `preserveModules` with `dir`, rollup can correctly lookup the dependency graph and transpile files and dependencies to the target module format, while doing so however it also misses moduleNames for each AMD module:\r\n\r\npreserveModules: today:\r\n```js\r\n// in rollup.config.js\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  input: 'main.js',\r\n  output: {\r\n    dir: 'dist',\r\n    format: 'amd',\r\n    amd: {\r\n      id: 'frontend',\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  preserveModules: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// before: main.js\r\nimport Another from './another';\r\nimport Component from '@glimmer/component';\r\n\r\nconsole.log('Component is');\r\nconsole.log(Component);\r\nconsole.log(Another);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// before: another.js\r\nimport Component from '@glimmer/component';\r\nconsole.log('calling another');\r\nconsole.log(Component);\r\nexport default {\r\n  firstName: 'Foo',\r\n  lastName: 'Bar'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n===========\r\nAFTER: `rollup -c `:\r\n```js\r\n// in dist/main.js -> AMD module name is missing! Dependency naming is correct\r\n// however the dependency path should also be customizable, ex: 'frontend/another.js'\r\ndefine(['@glimmer/component', './another.js'], function (Component, __chunk_1) { 'use strict';\r\n\tComponent = Component && Component.hasOwnProperty('default') ? Component['default'] : Component;\r\n\r\n\tconsole.log('Glimmer is');\r\n\tconsole.log(Component);\r\n\tconsole.log(__chunk_1.default);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n```js\r\n// dist/another.js -> AMD module name is missing!\r\ndefine(['exports', '@glimmer/component'], function (exports, Component) { 'use strict';\r\n  Component = Component && Component.hasOwnProperty('default') ? Component['default'] : Component;\r\n\r\n  console.log('calling another');\r\n  console.log(Component);\r\n  var Another = {\r\n    name: 'Foo',\r\n    lastName: 'Bar'\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  exports.default = Another;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Feature Proposal\r\nFor `preserveModules` with `file: 'bundle.js'`. Given:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// before: main.js\r\nimport Another from './another';\r\nimport Component from '@glimmer/component';\r\n\r\nconsole.log('Component is');\r\nconsole.log(Component);\r\nconsole.log(Another);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// before: another.js\r\nimport Component from '@glimmer/component';\r\nconsole.log('calling another');\r\nconsole.log(Component);\r\nexport default {\r\n  firstName: 'Foo',\r\n  lastName: 'Bar'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult should be:\r\n```js\r\n// after: bundle.js\r\n\r\ndefine('@glimmer/component' /* @glimmer/component transpilation here, just like how its done with dir: folder option, but also with npm module names as AMD module names */ );\r\n\r\ndefine('frontend/another.js', ['exports', '@glimmer/component'], function (exports, Component) { 'use strict';\r\n  Component = Component && Component.hasOwnProperty('default') ? Component['default'] : Component;\r\n\r\n  console.log('calling another');\r\n  console.log(Component);\r\n  var Another = {\r\n    name: 'Foo',\r\n    lastName: 'Bar'\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  exports.default = Another;\r\n});\r\n\r\ndefine('frontend/main', ['@glimmer/component', 'frontend/another.js'], function (Component, __chunk_1) { 'use strict';\r\n\tComponent = Component && Component.hasOwnProperty('default') ? Component['default'] : Component;\r\n\r\n\tconsole.log('Glimmer is');\r\n\tconsole.log(Component);\r\n\tconsole.log(__chunk_1.default);\r\n});\r\n\r\nrequire('frontend/main');\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/2784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/2784/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/521749931","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/2881#issuecomment-521749931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/2881","id":521749931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTc0OTkzMQ==","user":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T18:39:06Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T18:39:06Z","body":"Reopening
