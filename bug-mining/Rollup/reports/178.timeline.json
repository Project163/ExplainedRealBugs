I had no problem running vite build Friday morning, but since Saturday I started to get the \"Illegal Instruction\" issue.\n\nMy project is a vue web project that uses vite to compile the build files.\n\nThe problem is only happening on the raspberry pi, on my PC I have no issues.\n\nVite version 6.0.7\n\nTried with some other versions such as 6.3.5\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nOnly on raspberry pi\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\n    OS: Linux 6.12 Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) 12 (bookworm)\n    CPU: (4) arm64 Cortex-A72\n    Memory: 7.33 GB / 7.64 GB\n    Container: Yes\n    Shell: 5.2.15 - /bin/bash\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 18.20.8 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.20.8/bin/node\n    npm: 10.8.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.20.8/bin/npm\n  npmPackages:\n    @vitejs/plugin-vue: ^5.2.1 => 5.2.4\n    vite: ^6.3.5 => 6.3.5\n```\n\n### Used Package Manager\n\nnpm\n\n### Logs\n\nroot@server:/var/www/iowetea-web# npm run prod:main\n\n> iowetea@0.0.0 prod:main\n> VITE_SCOPE=main vite build --config vite.config.js\n\nIllegal instruction\n\n### Validations\n\n- [x] Follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [x] Read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- [x] Read the [docs](https://vite.dev/guide).\n- [x] Check that there isn't [already an issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues) that reports the same bug to avoid creating a duplicate.\n- [x] Make sure this is a Vite issue and not a framework-specific issue. For example, if it's a Vue SFC related bug, it should likely be reported to [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core) instead.\n- [x] Check that this is a concrete bug.

running `vinxi build` on a Raspberry Pi 4, I get the following error:\n\n```\nzsh: illegal hardware instruction (core dumped)  npm run build\n```\n\nI can confirm that the exact same repository builds fine on an x86_64 machine and even some other aarch64 machines (tested on a M1 Macbook Pro running Asahi Linux). So I suspect this has to do something with the ARMv8-A target not supporting certain extensions adding instructions that most aarch64 targets do have. Specifically I think this issue probably is with one of the dependencies of Vinxi calling C/C++ code internally, but I wasn't able to get GDB to show me which library.\n\nYou can replicate this error by creating a new Solid Start project on a Raspberry Pi 4 with `npm init solid`, select \"Solid Start\" and \"basic\", and then running `npm run build`, which just calls `vinxi build`. It also raises the same exception when running the dev server.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nksaraf/vinxi/issues/503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nksaraf/vinxi/issues/503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19076277338,"node_id":"SE_lADOAh_Tpc7DccX7zwAAAARxCORa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/19076277338","actor":{"login":"guilpejon","id":871362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/871362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon","html_url":"https://github.com/guilpejon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilpejon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-10T14:19:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19101703061,"node_id":"SE_lADOAh_Tpc7DccX7zwAAAARyjNuV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/19101703061","actor":{"login":"mdrv","id":100693152,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgB0oA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100693152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv","html_url":"https://github.com/mdrv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-12T02:53:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"robertkirkman","id":31490854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDkwODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31490854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman","html_url":"https://github.com/robertkirkman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkirkman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-12T16:07:08Z","updated_at":"2025-08-12T16:07:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/termux/termux-packages/issues/25670","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/termux/termux-packages","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/termux/termux-packages/issues/25670/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/termux/termux-packages/issues/25670/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/termux/termux-packages/issues/25670/events","html_url":"https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/25670","id":3308827443,"node_id":"I_kwDOAjnbis7FOLMz","number":25670,"title":"React
