tried to minimize the test case to the minimal reproducible example, so sorry for the somewhat obscure code. This is reproducible with more complex structure (and `import` / `export` in separate files) as well.\n\nSay, I have file `answer.js`:\n\n``` javascript\nexport const answer = 42;\n```\n\nAnd `index.js`:\n\n``` javascript\nexport { answer as exportedAnswer } from \"./answer\"\nimport { answer as importedAnswer } from \"./answer\"\n\nexport function doSmth() {\n  let value\n  value = importedAnswer;\n  console.log(value);\n}\n```\n\nAnd I use a simple build script `build.js` for bundling with `rollup-plugin-babel@1`:\n\n``` javascript\nrequire('rollup').rollup({\n  entry: 'index.js',\n  plugins: [require('rollup-plugin-babel')()]\n}).then(bundle => bundle.write({\n  format: 'cjs',\n  dest: 'dist.js'\n}));\n```\n\nIn that case output `dist.js` with `rollup-plugin-babel@1` applied and CommonJS as output format looks like:\n\n``` javascript\n'use strict';\n\nanswer = 42;\n\nfunction doSmth() {\n  var value = undefined;\n  value = exports.exportedAnswer;\n  console.log(value);\n}\n\nexports.doSmth = doSmth;\n```\n\nYou can see a couple of problems here:\n- `answer` is assigned to, but not actually declared as variable\n- `exportedAnswer` was not exported at all\n- `exportedAnswer` is still being (incorrectly) referred to from `doSmth`\n\nThings tried:\n- splitting `export` and `import` statements from `index.js` into separate files (`index.js` just re-exports, other file imports and uses) - doesn't help\n- reordering `export` and `import` - doesn't help\n- not exporting `doSmth` - it gets removed as unused in the output, but doesn't help for `exportedAnswer`\n- unwrapping `doSmth` code from a function into a regular module code - doesn't help\n- merging variable declaration and assignment of `value` - weirdly helps, but this is not always feasible in real code\n\nP.S. In `rollup-plugin-babel@2` (or without plugins at all), `exports.exportedAnswer = 42` is generated instead of `answer = 42`, so generated code is valid and works, although not very optimized as, when having lots of code, all the references to local variable get replaced with `exports.<somename>` property access. Although this is probably a separate question, unrelated to this repo.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup-plugin-babel/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup-plugin-babel/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":533256752,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTMzMjU2NzUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/533256752","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-31T19:01:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":533256755,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUzMzI1Njc1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/533256755","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1e99194cc0905ab8461f3d6434710b8c670193c6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/commits/1e99194cc0905ab8461f3d6434710b8c670193c6","created_at":"2016-01-31T19:01:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
