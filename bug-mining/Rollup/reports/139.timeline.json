 I remember @kzc mentioning that when developing uglify-es, rollup's test suite played an integral part for them in finding issues\r\n\r\nIt was indeed. Until TypeScript was adopted. ;-P.\r\n\r\nThere aren't many large ECMAScript 2015+ code bases with extensive test suites that are easily run. I also tested against Bublé and Butternut. I changed the Rollup config to not transpile the code and leave it in the original form and then minified it in-situ and ran \"npm test\". The source code had to be minified before Rollup unwound the imports and exports. Several bugs in Rollup, Bublé and Acorn were also exposed in the process - a virtuous circle.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/399076932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kzc","id":11593452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTkzNDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11593452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc","html_url":"https://github.com/kzc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1693451237,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY5MzQ1MTIzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/1693451237","actor":{"login":"kzc","id":11593452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTkzNDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11593452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc","html_url":"https://github.com/kzc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-21T11:51:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1693451238,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2OTM0NTEyMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/1693451238","actor":{"login":"kzc","id":11593452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTkzNDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11593452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc","html_url":"https://github.com/kzc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-21T11:51:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
