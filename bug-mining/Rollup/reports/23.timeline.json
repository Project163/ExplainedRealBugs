Was happening because of a multiple var declaration block:\n\n``` js\nvar argsTag = '[object Arguments]',\n    arrayTag = '[object Array]',\n    objectTag = '[object Object]';\n```\n\nMultiple declarations get separated (so we don't end up including stuff we don't need), which means screwing around with the source in such a way that the locations of the string literals got obscured. Fixed by cropping the 'exclusion ranges' (which prevent multiline strings from being indented along with source code) to exclude the enclosing quotes.
