I have the same issue as @futuris88. I run rollup on fish using the stock Terminal app on macOS High Sierra.\r\n\r\nI tried to turn off the `clearScreen` feature by configuration, but was not successful. The output on my screen still gets reset.\r\n\r\nI tried to update the source to not do this, but had to destructively change a *lot* to make this work. This is also why I haven't provided a PR yet.\r\n\r\nMy `rollup.config.js` looks roughly like this:\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: '...',\r\n  input: './built/src/app/client.js',\r\n  output: {\r\n    file:   './public/client.js',\r\n    exports: 'named',\r\n    format: 'iife'\r\n  },\r\n  watch: {\r\n    clearScreen: false\r\n  },\r\n  plugins\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any pointers towards a possible PR or a different solution.","closed_by":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1804/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
