So in situations like the above, if we encounter `A` first, we include the definition for `B` (because it's used inside the `A` definition), which leads us back to `A` which is ignored, even though it needs to go first.\n\nThe solution with Esperanto was to distinguish between 'strong' and 'weak' dependencies (weak meaning inside a function'), and reordering bundles with cyclical dependencies to ensure that strong dependencies appeared at the top. We can actually improve on this - because of hoisting, nothing can ever strongly depend on a function. (EDIT: actually that's not true, you can assign properties to functions which means the functions must be declared first. A function can never strongly depend on anything else, but we get that for free anyway.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
