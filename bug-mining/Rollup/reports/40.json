When I run rollup I get the following message \"Treating 'rollup-plugin-npm' as external dependency\". That is not relevant to me and is distracting because I would be interested in the list of external dependencies that my code.\n\nI assume that when using the `-c` flag that rollup is used to bundle the config file. Does rollup have an option to run silently and can that be used internally when rolling up the config file.
