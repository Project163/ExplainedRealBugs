Strange a stack trace wasn't printed for the error.\r\n\r\nYeah, that's a problem. For 'expected' errors (i.e. ones that are deliberately thrown, like duplicate imports) a stack kind of just clutters up the terminal, but this doesn't fall into that category. Wonder if we should print a stack for all errors that don't have a `code` property, since that's a reasonable proxy for whether or not it's expected.\r\n\r\nGetting back to the actual bug, I think it comes from [here](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/src/ast/nodes/MemberExpression.js#L34) — it's trying to resolve namespaced declarations (like `foo.bar` where `foo` is an imported namespace) and doesn't know how to handle keypaths that begin with `this`, like `this.bar`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/272569539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/272572467","html_url":"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/1258#issuecomment-272572467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/1258","id":272572467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjU3MjQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"kzc","id":11593452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTkzNDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11593452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc","html_url":"https://github.com/kzc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-13T23:07:19Z","updated_at":"2017-01-13T23:34:36Z","body":"Rich, my fix patches the *symptom* - it's the actual place where the error was thrown.

**current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.\n\nAs rollup is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.\n\nI recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:\n\n\nOf course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.\n\n\nDo you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests?
