Now I am not sure how to best approach this:\r\n- We could just add hashes to the list of forbidden characters https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/81fa9e9812be882e8ca791c0bd4314d23f0d5640/src/utils/sanitizeFileName.ts#L7 But this might break legitimate usages of the hash character for others (not sure how big the risk is, though).\r\n- We could limit forbidding hashes to ESM output as the filename sanitizer is only created once here where we know the output format https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/81fa9e9812be882e8ca791c0bd4314d23f0d5640/src/utils/options/normalizeOutputOptions.ts#L64-L69 Again, this would also apply when generating browser ES modules, but also the question is how important this is.\r\n- Everyone could build their own filename sanitizer via the https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#outputsanitizefilename option if the current one is not good enough. On the other hand, this also means that people would have an opt-out if the current sanitizer is too
