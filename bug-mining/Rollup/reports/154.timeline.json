Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nUsing `this.emitFile()` for all file emission from the rollup plugin.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n`this.emitFile()` is the correct future-proof way to emit files from rollup plugins. `this.emitAsset()` and `this.emitChunk()` are being deprecated, and it was never *really* supported to add files directly to the bundle the way they were.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nNormal test suite\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
