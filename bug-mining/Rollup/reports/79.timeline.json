on filing bugs: you will get a response **much quicker** if you can supply a minimal reproduction that we can investigate. Piecing things together from the scraps of evidence in this thread is very hard. 'Minimal' means no plugins (unless they're the source of the bug), and no Gulp nonsense. It's one thing for me to spend my free weekend time on this stuff, but when it turns out to be essentially user error I hope you can understand why I'm a little frustrated!\n\n#962 fixes this error and gives you a helpful warning.\n\n@Havunen I get the following warning with Inferno:\n\n> Non-existent export 'hookTypes' is imported from /path/to/inferno/src/DOM/addAttributes.js by /path/to/inferno/src/DOM/shapes/rootNodeWithComponent.js\n\nI can't find the corresponding files in the repo (some TypeScript thing I don't understand?) but if you remove `hookTypes`, you're golden.\n\n@larrybotha You'll need to manually tell rollup-plugin-commonjs that `react-dom` exports `render` using the `namedExports` option – it can't automatically infer it from the code (because it's just re-exporting another module). See [here](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs#custom-named-exports) for more info.\n\n@aubergene, @yairEO, afraid I can't know how to fix your cases from here, but if you use the version of Rollup I'm about to release, it will tell you.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/comments/247867911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":793408972,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzkzNDA4OTcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/793408972","actor":{"login":"Havunen","id":2021355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjEzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2021355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen","html_url":"https://github.com/Havunen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-18T19:24:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":793408973,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc5MzQwODk3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/events/793408973","actor":{"login":"Havunen","id":2021355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjEzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2021355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen","html_url":"https://github.com/Havunen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Havunen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-18T19:24:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
