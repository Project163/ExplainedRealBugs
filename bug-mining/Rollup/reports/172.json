Perhaps the `#` character could be stripped.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe hash character splits the import (note: only from within an `.mjs` file). It fails with:\r\n```\r\nError [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/home/runner/rollup-repro/dist/_virtual_' imported from /home/runner/rollup-repro/dist/index.mjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is despite the fact that the import (and filename) is `./_virtual_#test.mjs`.\r\n\r\n**Note**: I've filed this against `rollup/rollup` as although the particular example is using the virtual module I can imagine a situation where a valid import is structured (say within TS) that outputs to `.mjs` and therefore produces non-runnable JS.","closed_by":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/4222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/4222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
