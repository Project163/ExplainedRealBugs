@Rich-Harris,\r\n\r\nThanks for your response.\r\nI'm already doing this in custom plugins and I think it should probably be documented in the wiki.\r\n\r\nThat said, your solution does not work\r\n- If the `sourcemap` option is set in the `output` configuration as documented in your [gist](https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/d472c50732dab03efeb37472b08a3f32) (but your code can be updated easily).\r\n- If the `sourcemap` is disabled for a bundle in the output array, then plugins overriding the `transformBundle` can't know if sourcemap should be enabled or not. For example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  input: './src/index.js',\r\n  output: [\r\n    { file: './dist/bundle.js', format: 'es', sourcemap: false },\r\n    { file: './dist/bundle.debug.js', format: 'es', sourcemap: true },\r\n  ],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe, the `sourcemap` option should be pass to the `transformBundle` function [such as the `format` option](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/976043fa11a5cfd8aae10ac61dc51a511d837d06/src/utils/transformBundle.js#L10).

@lukastaegert,\r\n\r\nSince version 0.53, it is no longer possible to read the `sourcemap` option in plugins since the output configuration is no more available when the `plugin.options` function is executed: two plugins I wrote are currently broken ([rollup-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/mjeanroy/rollup-plugin-prettier) and [rollup-plugin-esformatter](https://github.com/mjeanroy/rollup-plugin-esformatter)).\r\n\r\nI think, this is due to this [commit](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/commit/996fea65327b5caeff9119619e930667425fb082) since the result of `mergedOptions` is being passed to the `plugins.options` function (loosing the `output` entry).\r\n\r\nIs that something deprecated? Do you recommend an alternative to get the output option?\r\n\r\n_Note: I still think that passing the `output` options to the `transformBundle` function would be great, and I would be happy to submit a pull request if you are interested_\r\n\r\nThanks for the hard
