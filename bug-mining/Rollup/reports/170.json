docs recommend users to use `rollup-plugin-node-builtins` and `rollup-plugin-node-globals` if you code uses node APIS, but they are pretty much unmaintained.\r\n\r\nFor example, `rollup-plugin-node-globals` uses a very old version of acorn instead of `this.parse()` provided by rollup, making any build including a dynamic import() to crash.\r\n\r\nI would be great if the `rollup` organization forked this plugins or find some alternatives.\r\nWe have submitted a couple of PRs fixing this plugins (since december of 2018), but they are not being merged.","closed_by":{"login":"lukastaegert","id":12949268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert","html_url":"https://github.com/lukastaegert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukastaegert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/2881/reactions","total_count":28,"+1":28,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rollup/rollup/issues/2881/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
