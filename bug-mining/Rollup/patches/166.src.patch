 ```json
 {
   "presets": [

+    "@babel/env"
   ]
 }
 ```

-Secondly, we're putting our `.babelrc.json` file in `src`, rather than the project root. This allows us to have a different `.babelrc.json` for things like tests, if we need that later – See the [Babel documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files#project-wide-configuration) for more information on both project wide and file relative configuration.
