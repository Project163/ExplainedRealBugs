Describe the problem\n\nMy mobile application needs to navigate to a third-party page (for authorizing or information reference), and I need a way to add a \"return button\" for user when he wants to abort that process (and return to the application page).  \r\nIframes doesn't work since some third-party sites use `X-FRAME-OPTIONS` or CSP header to prevent itself from loading in iframes.\r\n\r\nWith multiwebview, I can create a fixed navbar on top of the screen to gain more control over the navigation. \r\n However, this is not feasible on mobile platforms since multiwebview are *available on desktop and crate feature unstable only*.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to have multiwebview feature available on mobile platforms.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nListen to `onBackPressed` on Android (snippet from https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8142#issuecomment-2418365660 ), but it's not applicable to iOS targets.\n\n### Additional

solution above mostly works, the app won't exit, but if I press anywhere on the screen and then press the back button, webview still performs navigation if I'm using some kind of web router. I assume that webview receives focus and then responds to buttons without passing the event to the activity. In my case, I had to also override `dispatchKeyEvent`\n``` kotlin\n  import android.view.KeyEvent\n  \n  override fun dispatchKeyEvent(event: KeyEvent): Boolean {\n    if (event.keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK && event.action == KeyEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {\n        if (wv.canGoBack()) {\n            // optionally invoke window.androidBackCallback()\n            return true\n        }\n    }\n    return super.dispatchKeyEvent(event)\n  }\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/2962446730/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MilesVII","id":12629428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjI5NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12629428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII","html_url":"https://github.com/MilesVII","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesVII/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19430817409,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC7lts851WWS0zwAAAASGKr6B","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/19430817409","actor":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1e63c9cb9c7013fd0f57737a755148dc6b69330a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/commits/1e63c9cb9c7013fd0f57737a755148dc6b69330a","created_at":"2025-08-31T20:09:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/3251201117","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8142#issuecomment-3251201117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8142","id":3251201117,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts87ByWRd","user":{"login":"Blue-Pilkinton-Ching","id":49179161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MTc5MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49179161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching","html_url":"https://github.com/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blue-Pilkinton-Ching/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-04T00:23:24Z","updated_at":"2025-09-04T00:23:24Z","body":"I would also support adding this feature.
