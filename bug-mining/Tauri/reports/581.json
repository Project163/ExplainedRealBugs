Default should still be \"Window Class\" : it would be a non-breaking change :)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNo alternative, unless simply dumping those tools and find one using other characteristics of windows...\n\n### Additional context\n\nI have patched it on my side and want to contribute it to the upstream project.\r\nIt does depend on a new feature on Tao / winit side. Here are the correponding PRs:\r\n- winit : https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2978 \r\n  Status : All 55 checks passed, waiting for merge\r\n- tao : https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/pull/770\r\n  Status : waiting for merge","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7498/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
