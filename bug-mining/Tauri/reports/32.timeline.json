the bug**\r\n\r\nUsing a custom protocol like `wry://` from the examples, the browser will send `Origin: ` (blank) to the server.\r\nAnd any value for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` doesn't work, except for `*`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n1. Start a Caddy server with the below guide.\r\n    https://gist.github.com/Beanow/ccb667d1d7ffc674dedd7e54a62800ec\r\n2. Start the custom protocol example `cargo run --example custom_protocol`.\r\n3. Open devtools and run in the console:\r\n```js\r\nfetch('http://localhost:8080/wry').then(res => res.text()).then(console.log)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how the network tab will claim \"Origin: wry://examples\"\r\nAnd the server allows it with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: wry://examples`.\r\n\r\nHowever looking at the Caddy access logs, the actual origin header was blank.\r\nAnd the browser blocks the request.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"request\": {\r\n\t\t\"remote_addr\": \"172.17.0.1:41812\",\r\n\t\t\"proto\": \"HTTP/1.1\",\r\n\t\t\"method\": \"GET\",\r\n\t\t\"host\": \"localhost:8080\",\r\n\t\t\"uri\": \"/wry\",\r\n\t\t\"headers\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"Accept-Encoding\": [\"gzip, deflate\"],\r\n\t\t\t\"Accept-Language\": [\"en-US\"],\r\n\t\t\t\"Connection\": [\"Keep-Alive\"],\r\n\t\t\t\"Origin\": [\"\"],\r\n\t\t\t\"Accept\": [\"*/*\"],\r\n\t\t\t\"User-Agent\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.0 Safari/605.1.15\"\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"common_log\": \"172.17.0.1 - - [11/Aug/2021:19:15:56 +0000] \\\"GET /wry HTTP/1.1\\\" 200 27\",\r\n\t\"duration\": 0.000135124,\r\n\t\"size\": 27,\r\n\t\"status\": 200,\r\n\t\"resp_headers\": {\r\n\t\t\"Server\": [\"Caddy\"],\r\n\t\t\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": [\"wry://examples\"],\r\n\t\t\"Content-Type\": []\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n- Making a request from the `wry://examples` origin, sets the header `Origin: wry://examples`.\r\n- Given a  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: wry://examples` response header, the request is not blocked.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![network](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/497556/129091351-28787e7d-94c0-4c4c-a91b-c2c63a0684ad.png)\r\n![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/497556/129091441-50ec19f2-bea9-49d5-820d-346c26b54a21.png)\r\n\r\n**Platform and Versions (please complete the following information):**\r\nOS: Linux / Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\r\nRustc: 1.54.0\r\n\r\n**Would you assign yourself to resolve this bug?**\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nPossibly related to #348.\r\nDownstream issue https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2327\r\n\r\nOther examples are included in the gist/server.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfetch('http://localhost:8080/anything').then(res => res.text()).then(console.log)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor instance does seem to work given the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/897167315","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2327#issuecomment-897167315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2327","id":897167315,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts841ea_T","user":{"login":"pzeinlinger","id":26354635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzU0NjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26354635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger","html_url":"https://github.com/pzeinlinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzeinlinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-11T21:28:49Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T21:28:49Z","body":"* is not an option if credentials are involved. \nhttps://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-protocol-and-credentials\n\n> Am 11.08.2021 um 20:48 schrieb Robin van Boven ***@***.***>:\n> \n> ﻿\n> @iohzrd I see you mentioned\n> \n> I've tried adding \"tauri://localhost\", \"tauri://*\" and even * to my CORS config but it doesn't help.\n> \n> For me it did work to use * though.
