Description of changes\r\n\r\nWith Tauri apps getting more popular and added to nixpkgs, I believe it's time we share the tedious setup required to build them. This PR introduces a new hook in `cargo-tauri.hook` that builds on top of `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` (or more acurately, its hooks) to leverage Tauri's bundling feature in creating packages. It is compatible with the two primary targets we share with Tauri -- Linux and macOS -- and meant to be used alongside pre-existing tools for package managers such as npm, pnpm, and yarn\r\n\r\nSupersedes #318117\r\n\r\nCC @doronbehar for changes made to `yarnConfigHook`\r\n\r\n## Things done\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check what applies.
