This option is helpful in some specific circumstances but it will cause problems when signing a complex product. Specifically:\r\nIt applies the same code signing options to every code item that it signs, something that’s not appropriate. For example, you might have an app with an embedded command-line tool, where the app and the tool need different entitlements. The --deep option will apply the same entitlements to both, which is a serious mistake.\r\nIt only signs code that it can find, and it only finds code in nested code sites. If you put code in a place where the system is expecting to find data, --deep won’t sign it.\r\nThe first issue is fundamental to how --deep works, and is the main reason you should avoid it. The second issue is only a problem if you don’t follow the rules for nesting code and data within a bundle, as documented in [Placing Content in a Bundle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/placing_content_in_a_bundle).\r\n\r\nWondering if we should remove the --deep command from the bundler? My guess is this may break sidecar? Maybe we need to manually sign sidecar separately?\r\n@FabianLars

Describe the bug\n\nHi all, I have a Tauri macOS app that uses Apple's Accelerate.framework and CoreML.framework.  I've recently upgraded from 1.4 to 1.5, and now the bundler is failing when running `xattr -cr myapp.app` to clear any attributes on the frameworks. This likely has some relation to the work done for #7690.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n- Create a new Tauri app\r\n- Add the Accelerate.framework to the project via tauri.conf.json under bundle > macos > frameworks.\r\n- Try build a release build with apple developer credentials in the environment.\r\n- Build fails on `xattr -rc myapp.app` command.\r\n\r\nExample repo can be found at https://github.com/codesoda/accelerate_bug.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect that the `xattr` command succeeds and the app bundle is then code-signed and passed to Apple to be notarized.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```text\n➜  accelerate_test git:(main) yarn tauri info\r\nyarn run v1.22.19\r\n$ tauri info\r\n\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Mac OS 12.6.3 X64\r\n    ✔
