Describe the bug\n\nI am building a tray app and use `set_activation_policy(tauri::ActivationPolicy::Accessory)` to hide icon from dock.\r\nRecently I am adding deep link feature to my app, and I found that open app from deep link will make dock icon show again.\r\n\r\nI also have a tray menu item to toggle window show/hide and it works just fine. Only when accessing from deep link will cause dock icon appear.\r\n\r\nrust: \r\n```rust\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nfn show_window(app_handle: tauri::AppHandle) {\r\n    let window = app_handle.get_webview_window(\"main\");\r\n    if window.is_none() {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n    let w = window.unwrap();\r\n    if !w.is_visible().expect(\"get is_visible error\") {\r\n        let _ = w.show();\r\n        let _ = w.set_focus();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\njs:\r\n```js\r\nonOpenUrl((urls) => {\r\n    invoke(\"show_window\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, my workaround is call `set_activation_policy` again when open url is triggered. But it won't prevent dock icon showing but only hide it quickly after it reappears, so there still is a moment that the icon showing.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nDock icon won't show.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Mac OS 15.1.1 arm64 (X64)\r\n    ✔ Xcode Command Line Tools: installed\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.83.0 (5ffbef321 2024-10-29)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-aarch64-apple-darwin (default)\r\n    - node: 22.11.0\r\n    - npm: 10.9.0\r\n    - bun: 1.1.36\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri 🦀: 2.1.1\r\n    - tauri-build 🦀: 2.0.3\r\n    - wry 🦀: 0.47.2\r\n    - tao 🦀: 0.30.8\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api : 2.1.1\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli : 2.1.0\r\n\r\n[-] Plugins\r\n    - tauri-plugin-shell 🦀: 2.2.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-shell : 2.2.0\r\n    - tauri-plugin-updater 🦀: 2.3.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-updater : 2.3.0\r\n    - tauri-plugin-autostart 🦀: 2.2.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-autostart : 2.2.0\r\n    - tauri-plugin-single-instance 🦀: 2.2.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-single-instance : not installed!\r\n    - tauri-plugin-os 🦀: 2.2.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-os : 2.2.0\r\n    - tauri-plugin-log 🦀: 2.2.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-log : 2.2.0\r\n    - tauri-plugin-deep-link 🦀: 2.2.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-deep-link : 2.2.0\r\n    - tauri-plugin-store 🦀: 2.2.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-store : 2.2.0\r\n    - tauri-plugin-window-state 🦀: 2.2.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-window-state : 2.2.0\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../build\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - framework: Svelte\r\n    - bundler: Rollup\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12128/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
