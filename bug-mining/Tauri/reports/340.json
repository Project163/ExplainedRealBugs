I haven't tested this fully yet, but on my basic app it's working - it looks like the get_item function could be changed to \r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<R: Runtime> SystemTrayHandle<R> {\r\n   /// Gets an Option<handle> to the menu item that has the specified `id`.\r\n   pub fn get_item(&self, id: MenuIdRef<'_>) -> Option<SystemTrayMenuItemHandle<R>> {\r\n     self.ids.lock().unwrap().iter().find(|i|i.1 == id).and_then(|i| Some(SystemTrayMenuItemHandle {\r\n         id: *i.0,\r\n         tray_handler: self.inner.clone(),\r\n        })\r\n     )\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr am I missing something really obvious /  completely misunderstanding the component model?\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5491/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
