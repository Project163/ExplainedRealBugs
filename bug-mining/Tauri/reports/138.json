Describe the problem\n\nI have a react app where I can click and drag elements around.\r\nI would like the mouse to stay in the window when it reaches the window's bounding box, so that the mouse doesn't leave the window at all until the dragging finishes\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like an api command that locks/unlocks the mouse pointer to the Tauri window.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI have tried creating custom commands using `winapi`, but I ran into issues with `GetClientRect` not working properly.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No
