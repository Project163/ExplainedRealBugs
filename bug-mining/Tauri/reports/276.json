Go to repo https://github.com/Andrepav1/tauri-multi-window\r\n2. Run `yarn` && `yarn start`\r\n3. Run `tauri dev`\r\n4. Focus input component and wait window creation\r\n5. Press any key\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCreate the window, while keeping the focus on the input component.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Windows 10.0.19044 X64\r\n  › Webview2: 104.0.1293.70\r\n  › MSVC: \r\n      - Visual Studio Build Tools 2022\r\n  › Node.js: 16.15.0\r\n  › npm: 8.5.5\r\n  › pnpm: 7.1.0\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.15\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.1\r\n  › rustc: 1.62.1\r\n  › cargo: 1.62.1\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.5\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.2\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.0.5,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.0.4,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.12.2,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.19.0,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: default-src blob: data: filesystem: ws: http: https: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self' img-src: 'self'\r\n  › distDir: ../build\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:3000/\r\n  › framework: React\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .git\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ public\r\n  ├─ src\r\n  └─ src-tauri\n\n### Stack trace\n\n```shell\nno stack trace\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5120/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
