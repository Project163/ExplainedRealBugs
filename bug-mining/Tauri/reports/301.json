Instead of maintaining two sets of icons, I would like to just generate one set that is used by everything. This is probably a pretty common use-case.\r\n\r\nSo it would be nice to have a way to define alternative icon formats, sizes and file-names, that are also generated by `tauricon`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the files to be generated are defined here: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauricon/blob/dev/src/helpers/tauricon.config.ts\r\n\r\nProbably the easiest implementation would be to keep that same structure and provide it via the cli as a json file:\r\n```sh\r\nnpx @tauri-apps/tauricon icons/logo.svg --target icons --extra icons/extra.json\r\n```\r\nAnd then the `icons/extra.json` could be something like this:\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"folder\": \"../frontend/src/assets/icons\",\r\n    \"prefix\": \"icon-\",\r\n    \"infix\": true,\r\n    \"suffix\": \".png\",\r\n    \"sizes\": [72, 96, 128, 144, 152, 192, 384, 512]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts about that?","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5121/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
