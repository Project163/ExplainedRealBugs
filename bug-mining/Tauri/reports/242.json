For example:\r\n\r\nLet's say I want to bundle `FFmpeg` into my Tauri app. I guess the only way for me to execute it is using Sidecar. The code is looking something like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet cmd_output = tauri::api::process::Command::new_sidecar(\"./ffmpeg\").unwrap()\r\n        .args([\r\n            \"-i\",\r\n            &img_full_path,\r\n            \"-vf\",\r\n            &format!(\"select=eq(n\\\\,{})\", frame_number),\r\n            \"-f\",\r\n            \"rawvideo\",\r\n            \"-pix_fmt\",\r\n            \"rgba\",\r\n            \"-vframes\",\r\n            \"1\",\r\n            \"-\",\r\n        ])\r\n        .output(){\r\n            Ok(out) => out,\r\n            Err(err) => return Err( (StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, format!(\"Error executing FFmpeg. \\n{:?}\", err)) )\r\n        };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `FFmpeg` command should return some information through the `stderr` and it should return the \"raw data\"/pixels of the image through the `stdout`\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Tauri tries to transform all the output and sometimes we just need the raw data. Here is where it happens:\r\nhttps://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/597c98203cad9b45949816659f5f59976328585a/core/tauri/src/api/process/command.rs#L395\r\n\r\nI had this working with my own code `std::process::Command` before using `Sidecar`. \r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nMaybe we can have a function where we don't transform the data. Or a way to call `std::process::Command` with the relative path of the bundled executables.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4673/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
