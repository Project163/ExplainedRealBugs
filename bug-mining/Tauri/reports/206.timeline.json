Describe the bug\r\n\r\nSee the video below for why I'm ringing the bell about this:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3120639/174429998-b17eb281-c50a-49a9-9118-4193be949678.mp4\r\n\r\nWhen installing a standard Tauri application when the user does not have webview2 installed, the installer behaves like a malware-ridden installer.\r\n\r\nThe wix installer needs to be made to make it synchronous.\r\n\r\nThis was previously talked about in https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2452#issuecomment-918291043\r\n\r\nIt recently got a reply in the discord:\r\n\r\n> 1) Personally i prefer a non-quiet installation\r\n> 2) UAC is not an issue anymore because ms added support for installing it with just user permissions\r\n> 3) i still agree that running the wv2 installer at the end/after the app installation is too late\r\n> ...\r\n> it's indeed quite some time ago already so i'm not 100% sure, but i think we don't even need to use powershell but could use wix' ExePackage instead.\r\n> Unless setting tls1.2 in powershell works even if its not enabled system wide, because that would fix the installer on win7. and changing this setting for exepackage is not possible afaik.\r\n\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/731495028677148753/985618974882541578\r\n\r\nbut needs some action taken on it.\r\n\r\nIf there's discussion on how it should be implemented, I'm happy to send a PR. My personal opinions on how it should work don't match that of the Tauri WG, so I'm not going to do it without some information, but I'm happy to do cross-testing for 7, 10 and 11 to make sure the results work and is a pleasant installation experience, as long as the parameters are laid out.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Build a standard tauri application\r\n2. Remove Webview2 to cause the installer to install it for you\r\n3. Install your build, watch it behave in a creepy fashion\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nWindows pre-11, no WebView2
