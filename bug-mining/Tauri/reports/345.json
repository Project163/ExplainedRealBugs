In `tauri.conf.json` under tauri > allowlist > http > scope add an empty array.\r\n2. Insert scope value \"http://**\" in the empty array.\r\n3. Start Tauri\r\n4. In the application, make a HTTP request to `http://localhost:8080/api`\r\n5. The request is successful\r\n6. Change scope value to \"http://localhost:**\", start Tauri\r\n7. Behavior: Tauri does not start with error message `Malformed URI: invalid port number`\r\n8. Change scope value to \"http://localhost\", start Tauri\r\n10. Behavior: the request fails because `url not allowed on the configured scope: http://localhost:8080/api\"`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt should be possible to configure a `scope` under `allowlist` > `http` which allows all ports on localhost so that Tauri starts and requests can be executed.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Windows 10.0.22000 X64\r\n  › Webview2: 105.0.1343.33\r\n  › MSVC: \r\n      - Visual Studio Professional 2022\r\n      - Visual Studio Build Tools 2017\r\n  › Node.js: 16.16.0\r\n  › npm: 8.18.0\r\n  › pnpm: 6.11.0\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.15\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.1\r\n  › rustc: 1.63.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.63.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.5 (outdated, latest: 1.1.0)\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.2 (outdated, latest: 1.1.0)\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.0.5,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.0.4,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.12.2,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.19.0,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../dist\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:5173/\r\n  › framework: React\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .idea\r\n  ├─ dist\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ public\r\n  ├─ src\r\n  └─ src-tauri\r\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nTrying to allow all local ports because port is assigned dynamically.","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
