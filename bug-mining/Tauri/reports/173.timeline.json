Currently `target` is a String. By creating a custom type `UpdateTarget { os, arch }` we could constrain the target to valid target combinations only and outright reject unsupported/malformed targets. This would also help to solve #4161.\r\n- **Require `version` field to be strict semver.** Currently we accept both `v1.0.0` and `1.0.0` but only the latter is valid semver (the `semver` crate will reject the former). Requiring strict semver would allow us to get rid of the custom deserialize fn. This would also have the advantage that the `should_update` callback would receive proper `Version` structs instead of `&str` and could perform comparisons much easier (and reliably).\r\n- **Remove name alias**. Currently the version field can be called `version` or `name`. We never have `name` in any docs and it's rather obscure. Getting rid of it would simplify the interface.\r\n- **Add chrono type for `pub_date`**. Currently `pub_date` is a String, and we pass it through as-is. [chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/index.html)::[DateTime](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/compare/refactor/updater-json?expand=1) is ISO 8601 and implements `Deserialize`. This would make updates more secure as malformed dates would be rejected during deseralization as soon as possible.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1130618930","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4161#issuecomment-1130618930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4161","id":1130618930,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85DY-Ay","user":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-18T22:18:40Z","updated_at":"2022-05-18T22:18:40Z","body":"Tbh I think if you use the custom target option, you don't need the `{{arch}}`.
