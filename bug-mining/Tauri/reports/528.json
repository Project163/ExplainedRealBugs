Using `dev` works alright but `build` never loads. I always get `error sending request for url (http://192.168.0.x:1420/)`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI'm just using all the vanilla templates from https://beta.tauri.app/guides/create/#using-create-tauri-app. I've specifically tried bun and pnpm for svelte and basic JS.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe built app should load on device.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Mac OS 14.4.1 X64\r\n    ✔ Xcode Command Line Tools: installed\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.77.2 (25ef9e3d8 2024-04-09)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.77.2 (e52e36006 2024-03-26)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.0 (bbb9276d2 2024-03-08)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-aarch64-apple-darwin (default)\r\n    - node: 20.12.2\r\n    - pnpm: 9.0.2\r\n    - yarn: 1.22.22\r\n    - npm: 10.5.0\r\n    - bun: 1.1.2\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.15\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.12\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.39.1\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.27.0\r\n    - tauri-cli [RUST]: 2.0.0-alpha.14\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.8\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.13\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - bundler: Vite\r\n\r\n[-] iOS\r\n    - Developer Teams: <REDACTED>\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nThere's some Discord conversation about this here:\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1227758916872441856\r\nAnd here:\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1230704798488072282/1230718571080974336","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9509/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
