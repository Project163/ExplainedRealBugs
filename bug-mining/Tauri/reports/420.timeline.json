Public API changes:\r\n\r\n- [X] Remove custom protocol types and replace with `http` crate types - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7754\r\n- [x] Remove `tauri::api` module, not sure if it is needed, it still has hidden exports but ultimately it should be removed and replace with a public API if needed - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7874\r\n- [x] `path` and `plugin` modules both, have a `Result` type alias, where they should be using `tauri::Result` instead and not have Error types on their own - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7875\r\n- [x] ~~Make almost all callbacks (where it makes sense), return a `tauri::Result` because most of our APIs return `tauri::Result` and would be easier to use `?` operator.~~\r\n- [x] Remove `rand` and `uuid` crates, our usages of it could be replaced with an atomically incremented counter - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7939\r\n- [x] change `Env.args` to pull from `std::env::args_os` instead of `std::env::args` - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7876\r\n- [x] Consistent naming\r\n  - [x] Scope struct names, we have `FsScope`, then we have `ipc::Scope` - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7944\r\n  - [x] `TrayIconBuilder/TrayIcon::on_tray_event` should be renamed to `TrayIconBuilder/TrayIcon::on_tray_icon_event` - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7943\r\n  - [x] [Environment variables](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/29818de682146a75cd9a886f7b215154cad1d42d/tooling/cli/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md) used by tauri and tauri-cli is inconsistent and needs major renaming with possibly prefixing each var with `TAURI_<SCOPE>_<VAR>` - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7949\r\n  A few examples but not limited to: \r\n   \t- `TAURI_FIPS_COMPLIANT` should be `TAURI_BUNDLER_WIX_FIPS_COMPLIANT`\r\n   \t- `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` relies on `TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD` and so it should be renamed to `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`\r\n   \t- `APPLE_ID` and `APPLE_PASSWORD` should probably be prefixed with `TAURI_` unless these env vars are somewhat of a convention used by other tools, in that case, it should be fine to keep as is.\r\n  - [x] ~~`Event` and `RunEvent`, I think `RunEvent` should be renamed to `Event` and `Event` should be changed to `EmittedEvent` and a variant under `Event` (which was previously named `RunEvent`)~~\r\n   \t\r\n#### Internal changes:\r\n- [x] primitives in `@tauri-apps/api`, like `invoke`, `Channel`, `convertFileSrc` and probably all exports from [`@tauri-apps/api/tauri` module](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/29818de682146a75cd9a886f7b215154cad1d42d/tooling/api/src/tauri.ts), should be all just a shim for the globally defined equivalents in [`scripts/core.js`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/29818de682146a75cd9a886f7b215154cad1d42d/core/tauri/scripts/core.js) - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7942\r\n- [x] ~~Move from TS to JS with JSDoc for @tauri-apps/api npm package, see [discord wg-forum post](https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1146797909170466846)~~\r\n- [x] #8036\r\n\r\nThis list is open for discussion, I just made it because I keep forgetting about them and feel free to add more as you see fit.\r\n\r\ncc @tauri-apps/wg-tauri
