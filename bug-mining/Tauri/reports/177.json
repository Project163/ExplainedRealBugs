Uninstalling and re-installing the program fixes it.\r\n\r\nI saw this bug on the latest beta/production release of my application. There was a smaller update this Monday (5/16) that worked correctly. Maybe this is a regression in recent changes to the installer?\r\n\r\nI can post the diff of `tauri.conf.json` for the previous and current version if it is helpful.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Download and install v0.9.2 of the application: https://hypetrigger-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/Hypetrigger_0.9.2_x64_en-US.msi.zip\r\n2. Check `C:\\Program Files\\hypetrigger` to see that all resources have been bundled (`tensorflow.dll`, `tensorflow.lib`, `ffmpeg.exe`, and `data` folder)\r\n![hypetrigger-0 9 2-program-files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9583103/169621814-d522112d-7a04-4701-bd39-5b58c6affbff.png)\r\n\r\n3. Either accept the auto-update request to v0.10.0, or download the v0.10.0 installer (both approaches cause the bug): https://hypetrigger-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/Hypetrigger_0.10.0_x64_en-US.msi.zip\r\n4. After installation, attempt to launch `Hypetrigger.exe`\r\n5. Error: `tensorflow.dll is not installed`\r\n\r\n![tensorflow dll](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9583103/169622278-7a6ca65b-a6c5-4111-9c7a-0d4626a61664.png)\r\n\r\n6. Check `C:\\Program Files\\hypetrigger`. Notice that all the assets are missing from this version of the installation, even though all the same resources are present in `tauri.conf.json`\r\n\r\n![hypetrigger-missing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9583103/169622542-9225141b-a53c-443c-9f64-2880a6147351.png)\r\n\r\n7. Run the 0.10.0 installer again to uninstall the program, and then reinstall from scratch\r\n8. Launch `Hypetrigger.exe`. This time, the app loads correctly and all the resources are correctly located in the installation folder.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe installer should always bundle the correct resources when installing.\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ npm run tauri info\r\n\r\n> hypetrigger@0.9.2 tauri\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Windows 10.0.19044 X64\r\n  › Webview2: 101.0.1210.47\r\n  › MSVC:\r\n      - Visual Studio Community 2019\r\n      - Visual Studio Build Tools 2017\r\n  › Node.js: 14.18.0\r\n  › npm: 8.7.0\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: Not installed!\r\n  › rustup: 1.24.3\r\n  › rustc: 1.60.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.60.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.11\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.5\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.6,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.5,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.7.0,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.14.0,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: default-src blob: data: filesystem: ws: wss: http: https: tauri: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self'; worker-src 'self' blob: https://tauri.localhost/; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' https://unpkg.com\r\n  › distDir: ../dist\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:3000/\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .git\r\n  ├─ dist\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ scripts\r\n  ├─ src\r\n  └─ src-tauri\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nDid not happen on any previous version of the installer, as recently as 5/20/22","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
