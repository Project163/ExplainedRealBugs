These Frameworks have symlinks inside them, which is pretty common. The bundle process fails with this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: failed to bundle project\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n    0: Failed to tar.gz update directory\r\n    1: Failed to tar.gz update directory\r\n    2: `Is a directory (os error 21)`\r\n    3: Is a directory (os error 21)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDigging into the code for the bundler, [this section](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/tooling/bundler/src/bundle/updater_bundle.rs#L219-L224) that creates the tar.gz file is expecting each path to be a directory or a file. This fails to process the Frameworks because they have symlinks that point to directories – it's taking the `else` branch when the path is not actually a file.\r\n\r\nHere's a PR that seems to fix the issue: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/3934\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nIn `tauri.conf.json`, under `macOS.frameworks`, specify a framework that include symlinks. Any old framework on the system will work.\r\n\r\nHere's [a minimal example repo](https://github.com/dceddia/tauri-build-fails-with-framework/tree/main) where I'm pointing to a framework inside Google Chrome.app\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should build and create the .tar.gz file for the updater.\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Mac OS 12.0.0 X64\r\n  › Node.js: 16.13.0\r\n  › npm: 8.1.0\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.18\r\n  › rustup: 1.24.3\r\n  › rustc: 1.59.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.59.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-aarch64-apple-darwin\r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.8\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.3\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.4,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.4,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.6.4,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.13.3,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../build\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:3000/\r\n  › framework: Svelte\r\n  › bundler: Rollup\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ public\r\n  ├─ scripts\r\n  ├─ src-tauri\r\n  ├─ build\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  └─ src\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3933/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
