Does it exclude the file from being bundled too? How does this interact with the no-bundler option? How does it interact **with** bundlers? Should we provide env vars to the `beforeDev` and `beforeBuild` command to let the know about this?\r\n\r\nIMO there is too much left unanswered yet.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also what about removing the custom watching feature entirely and just pre-filling the `build.rs` script with defaults for `println!(\"cargo:rerun-if-changed=<file or folder>\");`?
