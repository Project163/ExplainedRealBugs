Describe the problem\n\nHello 👋\r\n\r\nIpc communication not working when create a webview using a custom protocol.\r\n\r\nFor example, add `myscheme://` protocol and create window with `myscheme://test` url.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn protocol(_: &AppHandle, req: &Request) -> Result<Response, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\r\n  let pathname = req\r\n    .uri()\r\n    .replace(\"myscheme://, \"\");\r\n\r\n  let resp = reqwest::blocking::get(format!(\r\n    \"http://localhost:3000{pathname}\",\r\n    pathname = pathname\r\n  ))?\r\n  .text()?;\r\n\r\n  ResponseBuilder::new()\r\n    .status(200)\r\n    .mimetype(\"text/html\")\r\n    .header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\r\n    .body(resp.into())\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n  tauri::Builder::default()\r\n    .register_uri_scheme_protocol(\"myscheme\", protocol)\r\n    .setup(|app| {\r\n      WindowBuilder::new(\r\n        app,\r\n        \"main\",\r\n

.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![...])\r\n    .run(tauri::generate_context!())\r\n    .expect(\"error while running tauri application\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter debugging, the following part was a problem.\r\n\r\nTauri initialize script only works when `window.location.origin` contains `__TEMPLATE_origin__` value.\r\n\r\n`__TEMPLATE_origin__` is from `struct InitJavascript` (inside `initialize_script` function). But the `origin` value seems to only accept `tauri://`. (below code)\r\n\r\ncore/scripts/init.js\r\n```js\r\n;(function () {\r\n  if (window.location.origin.startsWith(__TEMPLATE_origin__)) {    // only initialize if origin is same\r\n    __RAW_freeze_prototype__\r\n```\r\n\r\ncore/src/manager.rs (L932)\r\n```rust\r\n  fn initialization_script(\r\n    &self,\r\n    ipc_script: &str,\r\n    pattern_script: &str,\r\n    plugin_initialization_script: &str,\r\n    with_global_tauri: bool,\r\n  ) -> crate::Result<String> {\r\n    #[derive(Template)]\r\n    #[default_template(\"../scripts/init.js\")]\r\n    struct InitJavascript<'a> {\r\n      origin: String,\r\n```\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n  /// Get the origin as it will be seen in the webview.\r\n  fn get_browser_origin(&self) -> String {\r\n    match self.base_path() {\r\n      AppUrl::Url(WindowUrl::External(url)) => url.origin().ascii_serialization(),\r\n      _ => format_real_schema(\"tauri\"),\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[allow(dead_code)]\r\npub(crate) fn format_real_schema(schema: &str) -> String {\r\n  if cfg!(windows) {\r\n    format!(\"https://{}.localhost\", schema)\r\n  } else {\r\n    format!(\"{}://localhost\", schema)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSupport IPC for custom protocol not only `tauri://`. Or, wonder if it is intended.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No
