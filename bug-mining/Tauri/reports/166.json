There's a [fully silent mode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8560166/silent-installation-of-a-msi-package) where it shows nothing onscreen, and a [passive mode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33484750/msiexec-difference-between-quiet-and-passive) where it only shows a progress bar. Chatting with Fabian in Discord it seems like the \"passive\" mode might be a good middle ground - an automatic installation, but with some feedback so the user knows what's going on.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'd be happy to take a stab at implementing it - just grepping around for `msiexec` I see it's referenced in `core/tauri/src/updater/core.rs` and also `tauri/tooling/bundler/src/bundle/windows/templates/update-task.xml`. I think this would only require changing the `/qb+` to `/passive` in those two spots.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3951/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3951/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
