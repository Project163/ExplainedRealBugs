For available paths I have found [this documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/api/js/path/). I feel like the correct path for storing my data on a linux system would be the `dataDir` path. However, this path only contains the path to the folder, without a folder for the application itself as in `appDir`, therefore I have to handle that on my own, which is a tedious task. Additionally I think that this is so common, that it would warrant another path preset.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to be able to use something like `BaseDirectory.AppData`, that stores data in a folder for my own application within `dataDir`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNo alternatives other than leaving it the way it is and handle that in the application itself come to my mind.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5263/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
