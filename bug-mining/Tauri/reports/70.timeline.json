Describe the problem\r\nI noticed a recurring theme among discord questions: Issues with commands.\r\n\r\nHere is a short list of the most common ones:\r\n- Async cmds must return Result (throws a lifetime error otherwise) see #2533.\r\n- What parameters are available to commands?\r\n- `__cmd__<command name> is not defined` / `__cmd__my_<command name> must be defined only once`\r\n- macros are arcane magic, especially for rust beginners\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWhile most of this can be addressed through docs, I wanna propose a in-code solution:\r\n\r\n> rust pseudocode\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Ctx {\r\n   app: AppHandle,\r\n   window: Window\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype CmdFn = dyn Fn(InvokeMessage);\r\n\r\nfn cmd_sync<F,A,R>(cmd_fn: F) -> Box<CmdFn>\r\nwhere \r\n   F: Fn(Ctx, A) -> Result<R, Error> + 'static\r\n   A: DeserializeOwned\r\n   R: Serialize + 'static\r\n\r\nfn cmd_async<F,A,R,RV>(cmd_fn: F) -> Box<CmdFn>\r\nwhere\r\n   F: Fn(Ctx, A) -> R + 'static,\r\n   A: DeserializeOwned,\r\n   R: Future<Output = Result<RV, Error>>,\r\n   RV: Serialize + 'static\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage example (using the plugin builder proposal #2959 ):\r\n```rs\r\nasync fn foo(ctx: Ctx, arg: String) -> Result<(), Error> {\r\n   println!(\"{}\", arg);\r\n   Ok(())\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn init() -> Plugin { // not the Plugin trait\r\n   PluginBuilder::new(\"example\")\r\n      .commands([\r\n         // This is where the above function comes into play\r\n         cmd_async(foo)\r\n      ])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has several advantages over the current situation:\r\n1. It enforces users to return `Result`, clearly mapping to frontend promise states.\r\n2. Doesn't produce weird lifetime, or variable errors\r\n3. Handlers are heap allocated, this paves the way for one time commands. (A variation of the above allowing `FnOnce` as arguments)\r\n4. It's easier to both export functions (for rust users) and making them available through IPC.\r\n\r\n### Incremental Adoption\r\nThe command macro can trivially use this new system under the hood, so we don't break existing code. \r\nWe could then mark it as deprecated and remove it with v3.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis heavily inspired by denos op functions: https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/core/ops_json.rs\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n#3255\r\n#2533\r\n#3029\n\n### Features/Use cases to consider\n\n- One time commands\n- Abortable commands\n- Proper namespacing (`<module>.<command>`)\n- Commands callable from Rust\n- Command Scoping (allowing only certain contexts to access certain commands)\n- IPC middleware","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3256/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5938239531,"node_id":"AE_lADOC7lts85CMh5mzwAAAAFh8lgr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/5938239531","actor":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-23T13:52:58Z","assignee":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1019490687","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3255#issuecomment-1019490687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3255","id":1019490687,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts848xDF_","user":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-23T13:54:16Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T13:54:16Z","body":"You're right.

We held off on over-documenting things that we knew might change as a result of the external security audit. Now that the audit is almost over, and we are about to release the 1.0, we will get back to writing documentation that meets the expectations that people like yourself in the community need, in order to be able to hit the ground running.\r\n\r\nObviously it can be frustrating, but as a small team of volunteers we have always felt that it was more worth our time to focus on the code. Thankfully, we have a couple new faces on the team who are focussing on making the documentation a much more friendly place.

Not only would that be more ergonomic for the end user, it would make the API more robust, as Tauri would be in control of communicating data between threads that it spawns as opposed to the consumers of Tauri.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I think that if anyone were to make a `Tauri for people who are new to the rust ecosystem` guide, it would be tremendously helpful, as there seems to be a bunch of crates that are sort of expected that you know about and know that you need to use them (for example, wrapping state properties in mutexes so that you can modify them). Even things like pointing to existing reading for topics like Deref, moving, etc.\r\n\r\nI learned the hard way that rust doesn't like unwrapping stuff inline. I was trying to traverse through a Result that contained an Option that contained a String, and the compiler wanted me to assign the intermediate Option to a variable to \"keep it in scope\". I still don't understand why, but it keeps the compiler happy. I just think having a guide of common roadblocks and how to overcome them would be nice. A large undertaking? Sure.
