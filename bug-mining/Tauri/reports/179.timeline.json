Problem\n\nWhile implementing #121, discovered that Playwright is designed for web browsers, not desktop applications. Tauri apps run as native desktop apps using webviews, which require a different testing approach than traditional web E2E testing.\n\n## Current Approach (Won't Work)\n\n- Playwright targets browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)\n- Tauri apps are standalone desktop applications\n- Need tooling that can interact with native desktop windows\n\n## Alternative Solutions to Research\n\n1. **tauri-driver + WebDriver**\n   - Official Tauri testing solution\n   - Uses WebDriver protocol for automation\n   - https://tauri.app/v1/guides/testing/webdriver/introduction\n\n2. **@tauri-apps/api/mocks**\n   - Mock Tauri APIs in browser-based tests\n   - Allows testing UI logic without running desktop app\n   - Limited to UI/logic testing, not full E2E\n\n3. **Manual testing + Unit tests**\n   - Comprehensive unit tests for state/logic\n   - Manual E2E testing checklist\n   - Simplest but less automated\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\nAfter research, recommend either:\n- **Option 1**: Implement tauri-driver + WebDriver for true E2E tests (more complex setup)\n- **Option 2**: Focus on comprehensive unit tests + integration tests for daemon, with manual E2E checklist (pragmatic)\n\n## Context\n\nDiscovered during #121 implementation when attempting to configure Playwright for Tauri desktop app.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Research tauri-driver capabilities and setup complexity\n2. Evaluate if E2E automation worth the effort vs comprehensive unit/integration tests\n3. Make architectural decision and update #121 implementation plan\n4.
