My primary use case for this if for login callbacks for an application that interacts with audible, but I'm sure there could be any number of useful side effects. Also your statement is only partially true, if a plugin disallows navigation it will know for certain that the navigation will not occur, it's only that it can't be sure that navigation will actually continue just because it allows it. This is a constraint that plugin authors and users can be aware of and design for. It's not like this is actually more limiting than not being able to control this at all, which is the current status

you'd have to decide which handler has priority over this, and my idea is that it would be up to the user using the plugin, the handle of the first plugin registered is executed first then the one after that and so on...\r\n```rs\r\nfn navigation_handler(&self, url: String) -> bool {\r\n  if !window_defined_handler(url) {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if !tauri_app_builder_defined_handler(url) {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  for handler in plugin_handlers {\r\n      if !handler(url) {\r\n        return false;\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  true\r\n}\r\n```\r\nso users can control the execution behavior like this\r\n```rs\r\ntauri::Builder::default()\r\n\t.plugin(plugin_a::init()) // plugin A will have its navigation handler run before plugin B\r\n\t.plugin(plugin_b::init())\r\n\t.run()\r\n\t.expect(\"error msg\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nand if navigation was stopped by a handler, then remaining handlers won't need to run because a navigation has been stopped anyways so they won't need to run any side effects\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1620477258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1620522419","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7306#issuecomment-1620522419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7306","id":1620522419,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85glzWz","user":{"login":"jhutchins","id":1349982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDk5ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1349982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins","html_url":"https://github.com/jhutchins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-04T16:38:24Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T16:39:19Z","body":"This would fine for what I wanted too. As far I can tell the strength of this approach is that potentially less code needs to be run per navigation (because of short circuiting). The weakness would be that it doesn't allow the usage of multiple plugins that trigger callbacks on navigation to the same url where are least one cancels the navigation, which I'm not convinced would be a real problem in practice. \r\n\r\nIn short, I would be fine doing it this
