As someone who's not a rust god, I don't know the ins and outs of rust, so I'm still wary of making sure I'm appeasing the borrow checker god.\r\n\r\n - Do I need to explicitly borrow the state object from the command in the callback?\r\n - Is there a way to update state from within a command?\r\n - Does the command function need to wait for the callback to complete before exiting (given that the dialog function calls `std::thread::spawn`)\r\n\r\nI really like Tauri, but the examples that are provided are very barebones. I'm trying to use Tauri in a personal project, but every time I finish the frontend work for a feature, I have to spend ages battling to figure out how to do what I want in Tauri. Like for example: what's the purpose of `stateObj.0` in all the cases where there's tauri managed state in the [state example](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/next/examples/state/src-tauri/src/main.rs)? Why does the [commands example](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/next/examples/commands/src-tauri/src/main.rs) use `state.inner()` when [the documentation for that method](https://docs.rs/tauri/1.0.0-beta.8/tauri/struct.State.html#method.inner) states that it's typically unnecessary? And where's the `state.0` that the state example implied was required?\r\n\r\nHere's what I'm currently struggling with\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21042602/150550874-b7ba5bfb-cf7c-42d8-822b-c61e355a17ba.png)\r\n\r\nIs there any chance of the examples being updated, improved, and api usage being better explained? Or at the very least, is there any chance of a list of existing tauri-based projects being made so that people can refer to those to see how the api is used?","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3255/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
