The updater does not pop open the \"Upgrade App dialog\"\r\nIs this by design? or is it a bug?\r\nIt would be great if updater can honor redirects to get the latest.json\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround is to have the latest.json file as here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/master/latest.json\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nConfigure tauri.confi.json with the Updater snippet\r\n\r\n`\"updater\": {\r\n      \"active\": true,\r\n      \"windows\": {\r\n        \"installMode\": \"passive\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"endpoints\": [\r\n        \"https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/master/latest.json\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"dialog\": true,\r\n      \"pubkey\": \"dW50cnVzdGVkIGNvbW1lbnQ6IG1pbmlzaWduIHB1YmxpYyBrZXk6IDU3NjlFREE5NUY3MDk3QTQKUldTa2wzQmZxZTFwVjRTRlNwVS9wZHgrUVJ2QUhOSnhqYURyZFA4L3AzUmgrLy9vVnFsQ01QckkK\"\r\n    },`\r\n    \r\n   Expected result:\r\n   \"Update app\" dialog is shown when the app starts up.\r\n   \r\n   Actual result:\r\n   \"Update app\" dialog is not shown\r\n   \r\n   Notes:\r\n   Updater sends down HTTP GET to the endpoint and expects a JSON blob. In this case, the endpoint returns a 302 with the actual location of JSON.\r\n   \r\n   Current workaround:\r\n   Use an Endpoint of the form\r\n   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nirops/tradedog-public/master/latest.json`\r\n   \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n   Expected result:\r\n   \"Update app\" dialog is shown when the app starts up.\r\n\r\nUpdater follows the redirects and obtains the latest.json\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Ubuntu 20.04 X64\r\n    ✔ webkit2gtk-4.0: 2.38.6\r\n    ✔ rsvg2: 2.48.9\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.70.0 (90c541806 2023-05-31)\r\n    ✔ Cargo: 1.70.0 (ec8a8a0ca 2023-04-25)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)\r\n    - node: 16.16.0\r\n    - yarn: 1.22.18\r\n    - npm: 8.11.0\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 1.4.1\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 1.4.0\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.24.3\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.16.2\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.4.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.4.0\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - distDir: ../dist/tradedog\r\n    - devPath: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - framework: Angular\r\n    - bundler: Webpack\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
