The Rust function is called [tauri-macros/src/command/wrapper.rs:158]\r\n2. Its output is serialized as a `serde_json::Value`  [tauri/src/command.rs:197]\r\n3. The `serde_json::Value` is serialized as a `serde_json::Value` (see #5639) [tauri/src/hooks.rs:196]\r\n4. The `serde_json::Value` is serialized as a Json String [tauri/src/api/ipc.rs:69]\r\n5. The Json String is converted to `RawValue`, potentially copying all the String in memory [tauri/src/api/ipc.rs:70]\r\n6. The `RawValue` is converted to an escaped String [tauri/src/api/ipc.rs:85]\r\n7. The escaped String is put in a larger JS callback function String [tauri/src/api/ipc.rs:174]\r\n8. The String is evaluated in JS [tauri/src/window.rs:1289]\r\n\r\nI think that three serialization is overkill, the serialization in 3. can be avoided (see #5639) and probably the serialization in 4. too (also it requires a bit more work).\r\n\r\nString allocation might be optimized but this is not what takes the longest running time in my opinion.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nInstead of serializing the result of the invoked function to a `serde_json::Value`, it should be serialized directly to a Json String.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nIssue #4026 discusses memory leaks when using the `invoke` command. My tests also showed memory leaks. These two problems (performance issues and memory leaks) are related.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5641/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
