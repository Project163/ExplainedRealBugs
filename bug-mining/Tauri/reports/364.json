I want to avoid using rustup as that is a system wide (or at least user-wide) tool.  I'd like to have as many build tools as possible specified in my flake.nix.  \r\n\r\nI already have the rustc android targets installed and rustc and so forth.  But cargo tauri android init fails because rustup is not found.  I don't want to install the compiler and etc with rustup because I already have that.  \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like the tool to skip the rustup step.  Some ways to do that:\r\n\r\n- have an optional --no-rustup flag\r\n- check for compile targets being present before trying to call rustup to install them\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\njust install things with rustup during project generation, then delete the rustup installed compiler again when its through.  probably will do this but would rather not long-term.  \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
