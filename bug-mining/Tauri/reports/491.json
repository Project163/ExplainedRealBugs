After it been fixed, everything worked fine for a while, until the recent beta versions, where the issue happens again. I have no easy suspicion as to where it comes from this time, but since the biggest change in beta is the capability system, it could be a lead.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Create an example app with `pnpm create tauri-app --beta`\r\n2. `cd ./src-tauri`\r\n3. `cargo build`\r\n4. After it successfully builds, `cargo build` again\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe final executable should not be rebuilt. Instead, I always see a `Building [=======================> ] 360/361: tauri-app(bin)` line.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.22631 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 122.0.2365.66\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Build Tools 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.76.0 (07dca489a 2024-02-04)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.76.0 (c84b36747 2024-01-18)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (environment override by RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN)\r\n    - node: 20.11.1\r\n    - pnpm: 8.15.4\r\n    - npm: 10.2.4\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.8\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.6\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.37.0\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.26.1\r\n    - tauri-cli [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.5\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api : not installed!\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.6\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - framework: Svelte\r\n    - bundler: Vite\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9062/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
