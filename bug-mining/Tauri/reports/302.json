Even at the beginning, with the first 2 windows, it seems that `A` can't access `B` (see screenshot)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"602\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56818352/200511666-fcce3851-b99e-4b32-b2ea-8aeda7171ebe.png\">\r\n\r\nMy fellow developper tried this out on Windows, and the effect is less weird (only `A_child1` and `A_child2` have issues) but it's still suspicious\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56818352/200516803-3d565696-7b81-496a-9705-17877094cedd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Download the reproduction example: https://github.com/armand-colin/tauri-issue-window-label\r\n2. Run it\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI'd expect that all the windows will have access to each other _eventually_. I'd expect some timing to kick in, but here the windows never appear in the list.\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Mac OS 13.0.0 X64\r\n  › Node.js: 14.19.1\r\n  › npm: 6.14.16\r\n  › pnpm: 6.11.0\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.15\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.1\r\n  › rustc: 1.65.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.65.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-apple-darwin \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.1.1\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.1.0\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.1.1,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.1.1,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.14.0,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.21.1,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../dist\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:1420/\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ src-tauri\r\n  ├─ .git\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  └─ src\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
