Please search open issues before duplicating a new one.\r\n1. Make sure you are using the latest version of everything including: \r\n  - rustc \r\n  - ALL relevant Tauri Libs\r\n2. You must attach the results of cargo tauri info or yarn tauri info to your issue.\r\n3. Make sure it is an issue with Tauri, and not something to do with your side of the stack.\r\n4.

Configure your window to have `resizeable` as `false`\r\n2. Create an HTML element with the `data-tauri-drag-region` attribute\r\n3. Double click the HTML element, and the window maximizes\r\n\r\n### **Expected behavior**\r\nBecause the window is configured to not be resizable, it should not be maximized when double clicking the HTML element with the `data-tauri-drag-region` attribute.\r\n\r\n### **Platform and Versions (required):**\r\n<!-- Use `yarn tauri info` or `cargo tauri info` command to get this information, and paste it here: -->\r\n```\r\nOperating System - Windows, version 10.0.19042 X64\r\nWebview2 - 92.0.902.55\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 14.17.0\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-beta.6\r\n  @tauri-apps/api - Not installed\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 7.9.0\r\n  yarn - 1.22.10\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustc - 1.53.0\r\n  cargo - 1.53.0\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n/.git\r\n/app\r\n/node_modules\r\n/src-tauri\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  tauri.rs - 1.0.0-beta.5\r\n  build-type - bundle\r\n  CSP - default-src blob: data: filesystem: ws: wss: http: https: tauri: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self' img-src: 'self'\r\n  distDir - ../app/dist\r\n  devPath - http://localhost:8000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Additional context**\r\nWhile it says `@tauri-apps/api` is not installed, this is not correct.
