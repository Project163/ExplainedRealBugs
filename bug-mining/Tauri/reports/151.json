But it would be even better if there was an option to disable nonces for `style` and `script` tags individually! In our case, we'd like to disable the feature for style tags (since it breaks our app) but keep it for script tags (which are the more dangerous attack surface anyway).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIn addition to boolean values, also allow `\"script\" | \"style\"`. For example, the following would disable nonces for style sheets only:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n    \"security\": {\r\n        \"csp\": \"...\",\r\n        \"dangerousDisableAssetCspModification\": \"style\"\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3831/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
