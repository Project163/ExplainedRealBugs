It was also discussed in the discord and I was also able to fix the issue by using the same workaround - https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/731495064508825731/968988490769526794\r\n\r\nI'm making this issue because it's still a consistent problem on my end and I didn't see a proper issue get made -- just want something to track.\r\n\r\nWithout the workaround running the AppImage results in the following logs and the App does not startup properly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGStreamer element autoaudiosink not found.
