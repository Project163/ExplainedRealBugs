When I compile my tauri app with `cargo run`, (ie not android), my separate webserver receives post messages as normal.  \r\n\r\nBut when I run with `cargo tauri android dev`, then the POSTs are now GETs, which fail with 405.  \r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n- clone at this [commit](https://github.com/bburdette/zknotes/commit/5ff6ccb215c0e6cf6a5d968722b612370e490371)\r\n- have nix installed, with flakes enabled.\r\n- `nix develop`\r\n- cd tauri/src-tauri\r\n- cargo tauri android init\r\n- cargo tauri android run\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nExpected POSTs.\r\n\r\n**Platform and Versions (please complete the following information):**\r\nHost OS:nixos\r\nTarget OS:android\r\nRustc:\r\n`cargo mobile doctor`:\r\n[bburdette@HOSS:~/code/zknotes/zknotes/tauri/src-tauri]$ cargo mobile doctor\r\n\r\n[!] cargo-mobile v0.5.1\r\n    • Installed commit message isn't present\r\n    ✗ The tauri-mobile installation directory is missing!
