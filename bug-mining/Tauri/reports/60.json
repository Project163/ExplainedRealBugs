Also, the user can choose an appropriate database file.\r\n\r\nWhen the app starts up it looks for the last choosen database file. If it does not find it, it opens a dialog to let the user choose one.\r\n\r\nAs I can't set the title of the open dialog it is titled `Open`. This is not informative. The user is left to wonder what the app wants him/her to open. I want it to say `Choose the database file`.\r\n\r\nThe app was migrated from electron where the title of an open and save dialog can be set.\r\n\r\nThis feature would be useful in tauri too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to set a title in [the dialog options](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/api/js/interfaces/dialog.opendialogoptions/).\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI will probably have to open a ui dialog in the app that tells the user that after closing it he/she will be presented with a dialog to choose the appropriate database file.\r\n\r\nThis seems clunky. And is more work.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JonasKruckenberg","id":25329995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzI5OTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25329995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/JonasKruckenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasKruckenberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3232/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
