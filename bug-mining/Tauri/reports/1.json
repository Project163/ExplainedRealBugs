This happens both in dev and in release builds.\r\n\r\n### **To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create a Tauri project with API\r\n2. Add a frontend page with a Javascript module that contains an `import * as Tauri from '@tauri-apps/api';`\r\n3. Remove all windows from the config file (`\"windows\": [],`)\r\n4. Create a window in the app setup with a label that isn't `main`, that loads the frontend page with the api import:\r\n  ```rs\r\n  app.create_window(\r\n      \"test\".into(),\r\n      WindowUrl::App(\"test\".into()),\r\n      |builder, attrs| (builder, attrs)\r\n  ).expect(\"Could not create window\");\r\n  ```\r\n5. Run the app\r\n6. It will spawn the created window and then quickly after it will spawn a second window pointing to the index page of the frontend app\r\n\r\nI've reduced my test project to the minimal code that reproduces the error: [woubuc/tauri-double-windows-repro](https://github.com/woubuc/tauri-double-windows-repro).\r\n\r\n### **Expected behavior**\r\nI expect that only 1 window opens after 1 call to `app.create_window()`.\r\n\r\n### **Platform and Versions (required):**\r\n```\r\nOperating System - Windows, version 10.0.19042 X64\r\nWebview2 - 91.0.864.71\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 14.16.0\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-beta.6\r\n  @tauri-apps/api - 1.0.0-beta.5\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 6.14.11\r\n  yarn - 1.22.4\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustc - 1.53.0\r\n  cargo - 1.53.0\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n/.git\r\n/.idea\r\n/.nuxt\r\n/assets\r\n/components\r\n/dist\r\n/i18n\r\n/layouts\r\n/node_modules\r\n/pages\r\n/src-tauri\r\n/static\r\n/types\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  tauri.rs - 1.0.0-beta.5\r\n  build-type - bundle\r\n  CSP - default-src blob: data: filesystem: ws: wss: http: https: tauri: 'unsa\r\nfe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self' img-src: 'self'\r\n  distDir - ../dist\r\n  devPath - http://localhost:3000\r\n  framework - Vue.js (Nuxt)\r\n  bundler - Webpack\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"lemarier","id":22237916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjM3OTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22237916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier","html_url":"https://github.com/lemarier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
