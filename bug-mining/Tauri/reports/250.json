But when runtime-compressing the file with someting like https://github.com/upx/upx the generated EXE-file comes down to 2.2 MB (or 2 MB when running upx with `-9` parameter), without some lost functionality (at least what I can tell of).\r\n\r\nIn addition to compressing the generated files with external tools, this even would open the ability to do other wonderful things with the generated executable (e.g. generating hashsum-files, executing system-tests or other special build-pipeline-like stuff).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to be able via the `tauri.conf.json` file to execute some single command or multiple commands after cargo did build the executable.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nRe-executing only the \"creating installer/package/bundle\" part via Tauri-CLI command after manually executing UPX. Would be better to have this part of tauri, as it reduces manual steps.\r\n\r\nMaybe some additional `afterBundleCommand ` would be helpful which targets the phase after the installer/package/bundle was created. This could be used for auto-uploading the result to some server via custom-tailored scripts.\n\n### Additional context\n\nMaybe I am totally missing some built-in cargo-magic, as I am new to the Rust ecosystem. Previous I used to built some application using React and Electron, so this is quite a fascinating way to get into Rust.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4879/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
