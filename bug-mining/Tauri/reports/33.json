Go to the [docs](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/usage/guides/cli/#positional-arguments)\r\n2. Copy the example\r\n3. Read the match on JavaScript (https://tauri.studio/en/docs/guides/cli/#javascript)\r\n4. See the console, there's an error\r\n\r\n### **Expected behavior**\r\nCLI works fine and I could able to create a VSCode's similar CLI.\r\n\r\n### **Screenshots**\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### **Platform and Versions (required):**\r\n<!-- Use `yarn tauri info` or `cargo tauri info` command to get this information, and paste it here: -->\r\n```\r\nOperating System - Windows, version 10.0.22000 X64\r\nWebview2 - 95.0.1020.30\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 16.0.0\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-beta.10\r\n  @tauri-apps/api - 1.0.0-beta.8\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 7.10.0\r\n  yarn - 1.22.11\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustc - 1.56.0\r\n  cargo - 1.56.0\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n/.git\r\n/.github\r\n/.husky\r\n/.vs\r\n/.vscode\r\n/build\r\n/coverage\r\n/dist\r\n/docs\r\n/node_modules\r\n/out\r\n/packages\r\n/patches\r\n/scripts\r\n/src\r\n/src-tauri\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  tauri.rs - 1.0.0-beta.8\r\n  build-type - bundle\r\n  CSP - default-src asset: blob: data: filesystem: ws: wss: http: https: tauri: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self' img-src: 'self'\r\n  distDir - ../out/src\r\n  devPath - http://localhost:8080\r\n  bundler - Webpack\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Additional context**\r\nMore info: https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/625037620996734986/903540306304196618\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2821/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
