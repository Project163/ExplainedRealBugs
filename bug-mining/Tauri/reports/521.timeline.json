PR adds support for `bundle.ios.frameworks` for mobile iOS apps. This should close https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9962.\r\n\r\n## Work\r\n\r\nFrom what I gathered, these were the necessary steps:\r\n\r\n - Add the`frameworks` field to `IosConfig`, just like it exists for `MacConfig`.\r\n - Copy the value over from `IosConfig` to the `MetaData` passed into `cargo_mobile2` that generates the Xcode project.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I found a bug in the `project.yml` handlebars file, where the frameworks weren't unrolled correctly.\r\n\r\n## Checks\r\n\r\nI've inspected the resulting `project.yml` and Xcode project and the framework is listed in the _Link Binary with Libraries_ step.\r\n\r\nI get a build error in the Xcode build phase running `cargo tauri ios xcode-script`, but I'm not sure how to figure out what's wrong. If any of the iOS devs could help me out, that would be sublime. :)\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n- I am not sure if the comment within for the `IosConfig::frameworks` field is entirely correct. I copy/pasted it from `MacConfig` and replaced MacOS with iOS. Can we use full paths here as well, like it states?\r\n- I'm reading the frameworks from `IosConfig`, but do we want to check for an environment variable first (just like the development team id)? What should its name be?\r\n- I have no idea if this PR requires a new version. 🤷 How do I decide that?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9992/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/2150973165","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9962#issuecomment-2150973165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9962","id":2150973165,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts86ANT7t","user":{"login":"stijnfrishert","id":7056711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTY3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7056711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert","html_url":"https://github.com/stijnfrishert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnfrishert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-05T21:14:00Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T21:14:24Z","body":"Thanks, @pewsheen, didn't know that was possible, so I learned something. 😄\r\n\r\nDecided to go the PR route and learn something about Tauri's internals.
