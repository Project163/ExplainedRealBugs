After that the app gets unresponsive.\r\n\r\n### **To Reproduce**\r\n1. On Windows launch a Tauri app with `\"decorations\": false` and a custom titlebar made with `data-tauri-drag-region` attribute.\r\n2. Click once on the titlebar's outer edge - expect resize animation.\r\n3. Double click in the same manner - expect weird window's position and size change.\r\n4. After step 3 you can try blurring the window and focusing it again - expect to see a weird split of the window into two separate parts.\r\n5. Minimizing and then maximizing through a task bar seems to restore the app's responsiveness.\r\n\r\n### **Screenshots**\r\nSteps 2 and 3 demonstration:\r\n\r\n![first](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46848997/131245867-13ccc6e0-26ac-447b-8ba4-c6e1af2ffd76.gif)\r\n\r\n### **Platform and Versions:**\r\n```\r\nOperating System - Windows, version 10.0.19043 X64\r\nWebview2 - 92.0.902.84\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 14.15.0\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-beta.10\r\n  @tauri-apps/api - 1.0.0-beta.8\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 6.14.8\r\n  yarn - 1.22.11\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustc - 1.54.0\r\n  cargo - 1.54.0\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n/.git\r\n/.vscode\r\n/dist\r\n/node_modules\r\n/src\r\n/src-tauri\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  tauri.rs - 1.0.0-beta.7\r\n  build-type - bundle\r\n  CSP - default-src blob: data: filesystem: ws: wss: http: https: tauri: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self' img-src: 'self'\r\n  distDir - ../dist\r\n  devPath - http://localhost:3000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Additional context**\r\nI couldn't reproduce the issue on Wry `custom_titlebar` example.
