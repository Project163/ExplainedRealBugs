Describe the problem\n\nHi,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have Tauri Application that I have automated tests to check it.\r\nWe have different branch that we want to check (Prod, Master, RC, private branches, feature  branches).\r\n\r\nWe want to work with the auto-update feature.\r\n\r\nIn tauri.conf.json we set the updater endpoint from where to look for update but I need to install the application from different location.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCan we control this endpoint dynamaclly ?\r\nIt come up that we need to create about 8 different MSI that have different updater endpoint\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso another problem while running automation is that I try to make silent install using msiexec but due to security issues it works also when run as Administrator so I cant do it from my code.\r\nDo you have solution for that ?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks \r\nIdan  \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to get solution on how it should work \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No

When resolving issues, they are referenced in the PR's title (e.g `fix: remove a typo, closes #___, #___`)\r\n- [ ] A change file is added if any packages will require a version bump due to this PR

possible. \r\nI'm aware that there is other work in this area in 2.x, but we need to use 1.x for the foreseeable future.
