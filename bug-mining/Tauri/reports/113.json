It works in the earlier version of tauri , but does NOT work any more after upgrading to the latest release. \r\n\r\nI think it's better to let the users decide whether or not to put `tauri.conf.json` to the .gitignore.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAllow the users to put `tauri.conf.json` to `.gitignore`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nthread 'main' panicked at 'Couldn't recognize the current folder as a Tauri project.
