follow the guide of window.WebviewWindow ( https://tauri.studio/en/docs/api/js/classes/window.WebviewWindow ), everything is OK.\r\nBut if I change the event from 'tauri://created' to 'tauri://close-requested' (or tauri://destroyed), the event handler won't be invoked.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is to save working data and close other hidden windows after user click 'close' button of the main window.\r\nI have tried listen 'tauri://close-requested' , ' tauri://destroyed' and set window.onbeforeunload, none of them works.\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2996/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
