Describe the problem\n\nI'm building a Tauri app. For oauth, I want to create a new window where I can listen to the navigation events.  After the user authentications, the code is passed to the return url. This workflow is implemented in this wry example:\r\nhttps://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/blob/dev/examples/navigation_event.rs\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like the same solution, but using the Tauri API. When I tried using that wry example with my Tauri app, I end up closing the entire application when I close the auth window. I'm a little lost at this lower level.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n`on_page_load` looks like it applies to just pages with Tauri JavaScript #4037.  I started looking at Tauri Plugins, but not sure what the right extension point is for integrating a custom wry window and getting Tauri to manage it.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8116321806,"node_id":"CE_lADOC7lts85JPtnLzwAAAAHjxT4O","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/8116321806","actor":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"3f35b452637ef1c794a423f1eda62a15d2ddaf42","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/commits/3f35b452637ef1c794a423f1eda62a15d2ddaf42","created_at":"2022-12-27T15:54:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8124843308,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC7lts85JPtnLzwAAAAHkR0Us","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/8124843308","actor":{"login":"luoffei","id":10286864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei","html_url":"https://github.com/luoffei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoffei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"896b736b04405afe90d047de463dd1fe18503eca","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luoffei/tauri/commits/896b736b04405afe90d047de463dd1fe18503eca","created_at":"2022-12-29T08:01:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15579787143,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC7lts85JPtnLzwAAAAOgoK-H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/15579787143","actor":{"login":"108518","id":12320184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzIwMTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12320184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518","html_url":"https://github.com/108518","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3f35b452637ef1c794a423f1eda62a15d2ddaf42","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/108518/tauri/commits/3f35b452637ef1c794a423f1eda62a15d2ddaf42","created_at":"2024-12-09T09:07:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
