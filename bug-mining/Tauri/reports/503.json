I am attempting to include those binaries with my application by specifying a resource map as such:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"resources\": {\r\n  \"../../target/release/my-other-bin.exe\": \"my-other-bin.exe\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever the bundler errors with:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo:rerun-if-changed=..\\..\\target\\release\\my-other-bin.exe\r\n  Cannot create a file when that file already exists. (os error 183)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like it attempts to copy file where source and destination are the same. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we could filter out attempts to copy files when files are already in-place, when source and destination paths match.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a problem on macOS (universal build), because workspace binaries there are built into `target/universal-apple-darwin/release` and so the copying works fine.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Full `tauri info` output\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.22631 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 124.0.2478.80\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.79.0-nightly (becebb315 2024-04-17)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.79.0-nightly (6f06fe908 2024-04-16)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.0 (bbb9276d2 2024-03-08)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)\r\n    - node: 22.1.0\r\n    - npm: 10.7.0\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.17 (no manifest)\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.13 (no manifest)\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.39.3 (no manifest)\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.27.1 (no manifest)\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.11\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.15\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - framework: React\r\n    - bundler: Vite\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9666/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
