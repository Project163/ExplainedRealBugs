The biggest issue is that this is confusing:\r\n\r\n- It offers to do something it cannot do.\r\n- It doesn't report the failure to the user.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA few options:\r\n\r\n- **unmanaged install, unmanaged updates** (msi, appimage, dmg): search & prompt to install (works today)\r\n- **managed install, unmanaged updates** (deb*, rpm*):\r\n  - search for updates & offer to open download link in browser (tauri.conf.json field?) or\r\n  - search for updates, download and launch the installer for the user, and let the user authenticate etc\r\n-  **managed install, managed updates** (mac app store & windows store?): don't search for updates (fully managed)\r\n- **N/A** (dev mode): don't search for updates at all?\r\n\r\n*: don't know if possible to tell the difference between \"deb repository url\" which IS managed or ad-hoc installed deb (most common today I assume). If it's not feasible, it could be best to not search at all.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nAn additional issue is that we only have one url per [target, arch] tuple, which is hard to extend. E.g. linux *infers* appimage. This would make it tricky to add support for e.g. automatic deb downloads.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
