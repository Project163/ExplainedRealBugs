Specifically targets of the kind `AnyLabel`, which is the default when just adding a string as target in both `emitTo` and `listen`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a listener is set with the target `\"main\"`, and `emitTo(\"main\", \"eventName\", \"payload\")` is run, the listener will not be triggered.\r\n\r\nI have tried to trace this behavior back to the source, and have stumbled upon this snippet from the implementation of the `emit_to` function in Rust.\r\n```rust\r\n// https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/12ffc19ce08eeafdedc65207f312432aa2cf9c84/crates/tauri/src/manager/mod.rs#L590-L606\r\nmatch target {\r\n  // if targeting all, emit to all using emit without filter\r\n  EventTarget::Any => self.emit(event, payload),\r\n\r\n  // if targeting any label, emit using emit_filter and filter labels\r\n  EventTarget::AnyLabel {\r\n    label: target_label,\r\n  } => self.emit_filter(event, payload, |t| match t {\r\n    EventTarget::Window { label }\r\n    | EventTarget::Webview { label }\r\n    | EventTarget::WebviewWindow { label } => label == &target_label,\r\n    _ => false,\r\n  }),\r\n\r\n  // otherwise match same target\r\n  _ => self.emit_filter(event, payload, |t| t == &target),\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere, `target` is the target set in `emit_to`. When this is of the kind `AnyLabel`, the code will enter the second `match`, where it checks for `t` which is the listener target. It checks if `t` is of kind `Window`, `Webview` or `WebviewWindow`, none of which apply to `AnyLabel` by which it will return false when the listener is initialized without a specific kind.\r\n\r\nIf a kind has been specified for `emit_to`, it will go to the bottom line, and only match the same targets. Again, if the listener is initialized without a specific kind, and therefore gets the kind `AnyLabel`, it will not trigger the listener.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAs far as I understand it, the expected behaviour would be to let `AnyLabel` serve as a \"wildcard\" for both `emitTo` and `listen`. So if any of the two are of the kind `AnyLabel`, any event with a label would be served between the two.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.22631 x86_64 (X64)\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 130.0.2849.56\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.82.0 (f6e511eec 2024-10-15)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.82.0 (8f40fc59f 2024-08-21)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)\r\n    - node: 20.15.1\r\n    - yarn: 4.5.1\r\n    - npm: 10.7.0\r\n    - deno: deno 2.0.4\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri 🦀: 2.0.6\r\n    - tauri-build 🦀: 2.0.2\r\n    - wry 🦀: 0.46.3\r\n    - tao 🦀: 0.30.5\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api : 2.0.3\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli : 2.0.5\r\n\r\n[-] Plugins\r\n    - tauri-plugin-dialog 🦀: 2.0.3\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-dialog : 2.0.1\r\n    - tauri-plugin-fs 🦀: 2.0.3\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-fs : 2.0.1\r\n    - tauri-plugin-process 🦀: 2.0.1\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-process : 2.0.0\r\n    - tauri-plugin-http 🦀: 2.0.3\r\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-http : 2.0.1\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:4321/\r\n    - framework: Svelte\r\n    - bundler: Rollup\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nI would be willing to work on a PR fixing this issue, but I would like to discuss the exact issue and expected behavior in depth before starting to change things in the event API.","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
