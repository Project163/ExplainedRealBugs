Currently I created 2 extra config files `tauri.conf.dev.json` and   `tauri.conf.stg.json`. These have a custom `identifier` set inside and currently I need to regenerate the XCode project to build these custom identifiers but the init command doesn't allow specifiying a different config. It only uses the default one.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe should be able to use the `--config tauri.conf.stg.json` the same as when we run the `dev` or `build` commands.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nMaybe a better setup for different flavors could be discussed where we don't have to regenerate the project files to change which flavor we are building. There could be different targets in the XCode project for each flavor? But for now just allowing `--config` in the `init` command will allow this to work.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/13284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/13284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
