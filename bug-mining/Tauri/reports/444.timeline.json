This will increase compatibility across Linux distros, especially with the v2 release coming. I would like to support all Snap cores (core18, core20, and core22), although due to Tauri's v2 release, we may only be able to use core22 (webkitgtk dependency). This is still in the air.\r\n\r\nOf course, any concerns etc. please drop them here. I plan on using serde_yaml crate to parse and generate the yaml files for Snapcraft.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I've opted to let Tauri handle compiling the project before bundling everything together in snapcraft. Typically, snapcraft will compile the project as well... although I've been having trouble with tauri-cli inside the Snap VM.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6532/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1490359942","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4402#issuecomment-1490359942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4402","id":1490359942,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85Y1RaG","user":{"login":"fetzsav","id":66761778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzYxNzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66761778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav","html_url":"https://github.com/fetzsav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fetzsav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-30T14:01:22Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T14:01:22Z","body":"> When I'm donating to Tauri, the money will just go for the security audit.

the time of writing, there are only two official ways for using the Modrinth App on Linux - AppImages and Debian packages. While this is fine for people on Debian-based distributions, and those who like using AppImages, some may prefer to use a package manager such as `flatpak` or `dnf` as it's easier to manage packages that way. According to [this comment](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus/issues/497#issuecomment-1666737825), the current compiled Debian packages aren't very great right now because they don't include proper dependency info and leave out some important stuff.\n\nAlong with AppImages and Debian packages, there are various packaging solutions to consider. If there's other packaging types that you think would be a good idea, suggest them in this thread. I personally think that the Flatpak should be maintained by Modrinth, and the rest could be maintained by members of the community if they wanted to do so. I think this is especially important as the Modrinth App is now in an [open beta](https://blog.modrinth.com/p/launcher).\n\nThis issue serves as a place to discuss packaging, and I'll also treat this as a sort of \"unofficial download page\" for Linux users with updated information on what packages to use and where to get them.\n\n## Indicators\n\n### ✅\n  1. a package exists and works properly\n  2. that package is considered ready for daily use\n  3. that package is available on commonly used repositories, such as a Flatpak being on Flathub for example\n\n### 🔃\n  1. same as 1 and 2 in the above\n  2. however, that package is not available on commonly used repositories, but is available on a developer's personal repository. this may not be applicable for some solutions and will use the checkmark icon instead, such as COPR\n\n## Unix/Unix-like packaging\n\n### ✅ <img alt=\"Flathub logo\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatpak/flatpak/main/flatpak.png\" height=\"18px\"> [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/)\n\nPackage is available and maintained on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.modrinth.ModrinthApp) - `com.modrinth.ModrinthApp` - thank you @getchoo and other contributors!\n\n<details>\n\nPackage that can be used on most common Linux distributions, and also good for security as Flatpaks are sandboxed unlike other types. This will be the package that most Linux users are looking for.\n\n###### Notable mentions/issues\n\n- https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3619 (@Hyphrio)\n- May be tricky to upload to Flathub, see [this comment](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus/issues/497#issuecomment-1666737825)\n\n###### Who's working on this?\n\n- @getchoo is currently working on a package https://github.com/modrinth/theseus/pull/559\n- @getchoo opened a PR for Flathub https://github.com/flathub/flathub/pull/4950\n\n</details>\n\n### ✅ <img src=\"https://wiki.installgentoo.com/images/f/f9/Arch-linux-logo.png\" height=\"18px\"> [Arch](https://archlinux.org/)\n\nPackages are available and maintained on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/modrinth-app) - `modrinth-app`, `modrinth-app-bin`, and `modrinth-app-appimage` - thank you [Antti](https://aur.archlinux.org/account/Antti)!\n\n<details>\n\n###### Any ideas on this?\n\n- @offbeat-stuff suggested making a PKGBUILD that extracts the `deb` package to be used as an Arch pacman package. [Here's an example](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=linux-xanmod-linux-bin-x64v3)\n\n###### Notable mentions/issues\n\n- https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3728 (@Hyphrio)\n- https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/4301 (@Hyphrio)\n\n###### Who's working on this?\n\n- [Antti](https://aur.archlinux.org/account/Antti) has made two AUR packages\n  - `modrinth-app`\n  - `modrinth-app-bin`\n- [Nixuge](https://aur.archlinux.org/account/Nixuge) has made two AUR packages, however they could be broken as they miss many dependencies\n  - `modrinth-app-git`\n  - `modrinth-cli-git`\n\n</details>\n\n### ✅ <img alt=\"Nix logo\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Nix_snowflake.svg\" height=\"16px\"> [Nix](https://nixos.org/)\n\nPackage is available and maintained on [Nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=modrinth-app) - `modrinth-app` - thank you @getchoo and other contributors!\n\n<details>\n\nNix can be used on both Linux and Darwin systems and is the package manager for NixOS.\n\n###### Who's working on this?\n\n- @getchoo has a PR in nixpkgs https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/289149\n- @getchoo is also working on a Nix flake https://github.com/modrinth/theseus/pull/561\n\n</details>\n\n### ✅ <img alt=\"Homebrew logo\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Homebrew_logo.svg\" width=\"22px\" height=\"22px\"> [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)\n\nPackage is available and maintained on [Homebrew Cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/modrinth) - `modrinth`.\n\n<details>\n\nHomebrew is a package manager for MacOS (and Linux). Idea from https://github.com/modrinth/theseus/issues/560. It would allow for easy installation on MacOS.\n\n</details>\n\n### ✅ <img alt=\"Gentoo logo\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Gentoo_Linux_logo_matte.svg\" height=\"18px\"> [Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU)\n\nPackage is available and maintained on [Gentoo GURU](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU) - `modrinth-app-bin` - thank you @Norbiros and other contributors!\n\n<details>\n\nUser-maintained package repository for Gentoo.\n\n</details>\n\n### <img alt=\"Fedora logo\" src=\"https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/fedora-1-logo-png-transparent.png\" height=\"18px\"> [Fedora Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/)\n\n<details>\n\nUser-maintained package repositories for Fedora, CentOS Stream, and RHEL. Can be enabled with `dnf copr enable <author>/<repo>`\n\n###### Notable mentions/issues\n\n- https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4402 (@Hyphrio)\n- May be difficult, see [this comment](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus/issues/497#issuecomment-1666737825)\n\n</details>\n\n## Windows packaging\n\n### 🔃 🍨 [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)\n\nPackage is available and maintained on [brawaru/bucket](https://github.com/brawaru/bucket) - thank you @brawaru!\n\n<details>\n\nScoop is a command-line installer for Windows. It has many benefits, such as installing packages in a portable way (by default, it installs packages to `~/scoop`). Package manifests are just simple JSON files - this shouldn't be too hard to set up.\n\n</details>\n\n### ✅ <img alt=\"WinGet logo\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/winget-cli/master/.github/images/WindowsPackageManager_Assets/ICO/PNG/_48.png\" height=\"18px\"> [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/)\n\nPackage is available on [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/m/Modrinth/ModrinthApp) - currently [looking for maintainers](https://github.com/modrinth/code/issues/497#issuecomment-2679735144)!\n\n<details>\n\nWinGet is Microsoft's own package manager.\n\n</details>\n\n## Other information\n\nTheseus is very complex to package and doing so for many different formats at a time would be a little chaotic. I think that the common package types like Flatpak, Arch and Nix packages should be done.\n\nLeave your thoughts below!\n\n###### For discussion, see the [thread](https://discord.com/channels/734077874708938864/1138510665947041876) in the `#development` channel of the [Modrinth Discord](https://discord.gg/modrinth).
