The `winres` crate returns a default path, `bin\\x64\\rc.exe` when it cannot determine a real location. In my case, a real location could not be determined because company IT security has restricted registry viewing. Said differently `winres` cannot read my registry key `HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows Kits\\Installed Roots` so it defaults to `bin/x64/rc.exe`. This is not the correct path. \r\n\r\n## The Solution\r\nIf I edit how I'm calling `winres` to below, then things start working:\r\n```\r\n  let mut res = winres::WindowsResource::new();\r\n  res.set_toolkit_path(\"C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/bin/10.0.19041.0/x64/\");\r\n```\r\nI verified this by running a hard-coded version of tauri-build that had this path in it.\r\n\r\nThe two fixes i propose are: \r\n1. `winres` probably needs a warning if the path isn't found and it is using defaults\r\n2. `tauri-build` needs a new config parameter to allow me to pass in the right rc path.\r\n\r\nI'll get to work on these PRs right away.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/969191116/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SyntaxRules","id":4117657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTc2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4117657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules","html_url":"https://github.com/SyntaxRules","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyntaxRules/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
