can reproduce this bug. Actually, the App is focused. So, for vanilla JS template, I performed the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Add `greet();` in JS file, inside the `window.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\")` like this, so that `greet()` is called as soon as DOM is loaded. Also, add `Escape` keypress event.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwindow.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", () => {\r\n  greetInputEl = document.querySelector(\"#greet-input\");\r\n  greetMsgEl = document.querySelector(\"#greet-msg\");\r\n  greet();\r\n});\r\n\r\ndocument.addEventListener('keypress', (event) =>  {\r\n  if (event.code === 'Escape'){\r\n    greet()\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Edit `greet()` in `main.rs` to print `is_focused()` for each `webview_window()`.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nfn greet(app: tauri::AppHandle ,name: &str) -> String {\r\n    for i in app.webview_windows() {\r\n        println!(\"{:?}\", i.1.is_focused());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    format!(\"Hello, {}! You've been greeted from Rust!\", name)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Result:** It printed `Ok(true)`, and App is indeed in focus. However, nothing happens on pressing `Escape`, till I click inside the window.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/2329782026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"naman-crabnebula","id":155433377,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUO5oQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155433377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula","html_url":"https://github.com/naman-crabnebula","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naman-crabnebula/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/2414865274","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10746#issuecomment-2414865274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10746","id":2414865274,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts86P7-t6","user":{"login":"vemonet","id":3778439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzg0Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3778439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet","html_url":"https://github.com/vemonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vemonet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-15T19:43:43Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T19:43:43Z","body":"Interesting, so using `app.webview_windows()` show that Tauri **thinks** the app is focus when it is actually not...

Describe the bug\n\nWhen I open Emoji Mart, either from the app launcher or by running `emojimart` in the terminal, the search box is not automatically focused. I have to manually click on it before typing, which is a bit annoying.  \n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Open Emoji Mart using the app launcher or by running `emojimart` in the terminal.  \n2. Try typing immediately – nothing happens because the search box is not focused.  \n3. Click on the search box manually to start searching.  \n\n### Operating System\n\nArch Linux Gnome on Wayland\n\n### Emoji Mart version\n\n0.3.0\n\n### Additional context\n\n## Expected Behavior  \nThe search box should be focused automatically when Emoji Mart launches, which allows users to start typing immediately to search for emojis without extra clicks.  \n\n\nThanks for looking into this! 😊  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vemonet/EmojiMart/issues/19/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vemonet/EmojiMart/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
