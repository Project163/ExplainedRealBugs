Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWhen I set a dylib file path in `tauri.conf.json: tauri.bundle.macOS.frameworks`:\r\n```json5\r\n{\r\n  \"tauri\": {\r\n    \"bundle\": {\r\n      \"macOS\": {\r\n        \"frameworks\": [\r\n          \"../libs/libmsodbcsql.18.dylib\"\r\n        ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn error occurs when packaging:\r\n```log\r\nError failed to bundle project: Failed to bundle frameworks: Failed to bundle frameworks: `Framework path should have .framework extension: ../libs/libmsodbcsql.18.dylib`\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAs Apple's official documentation (ref [this](), see table 2-5) states:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `Contents/Frameworks` directory is \r\n> Contains any private <ins>shared libraries</ins> and <ins>frameworks</ins> used by the executable.\r\n\r\n`dylib` files should also be a legal file type that can be copy to the `Contents/Frameworks` directory.\r\n\r\nI think we can support both `*.dylib` file and `*.framework` bundle in `tauri.bundle.macOS.frameworks`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nConsidering that developers usually need to customize the content in the app bundle.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use a <ins>post-script stage</ins> for users to use custom scripts to process the content in the app bundle, this stage should be after the tauri bundle is completed, and before the codesign.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No
