Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI'm using the application updater with a static JSON file. \r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  \"version\": \"v0.4.0\",\r\n  \"platforms\": { \r\n    \"darwin-x86_64\": {\r\n      \"signature\": \"something\", \r\n      \"url\": \"https://something.com/macos/AppName.app.tar.gz\" \r\n    }, \r\n    \"darwin-aarch64\": { \r\n      \"signature\": \"something\", \r\n      \"url\": \"https://something.com/macos/AppName.app.tar.gz\" \r\n    }\r\n  } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe app uses the built in dialog to prompt to install and restart the application. The updater status reaches \"DONE\" in dev mode:\r\n```\r\nDownloaded 16384 of Some(7682688)\r\nDownloaded 16384 of Some(7682688)\r\nDownloaded 14469 of Some(7682688)\r\nUpdate has been downloaded!\r\nApp has been updated\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this, if I confirm that I would like to restart the application, I get the following error in the terminal, and the update is never applied:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread ‘tokio-runtime-worker’ panicked at ‘application failed to start: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: “No such file or directory” }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich points to this function in the tauri api/process.rs:\r\n```\r\npub fn restart(env: &Env) {\r\n  use std::process::{exit, Command};\r\n  \r\n  if let Ok(path) = current_binary(env) {\r\n    Command::new(path)\r\n      .args(&env.args)\r\n      .spawn()\r\n      .expect(\"application failed to start\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  exit(0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to offload the updater functionality to the JavaScript side to see if I could get more information and built the app. Logging errors to the console, I also saw this error when built with an updater status of \"DOWNLOADED\" and then \"ERROR\":\r\n```\r\nTauri API error: Cross-device link (os error 18) \r\n```\r\n\r\nHow do I get the restart and update functionality to be applied?\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Set tauri.conf.json to have an active updater with appropriate endpoints; Build the app with appropriate environment variables as noted in the [documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/updater/#checking-for-updates).\r\n2. Run the application locally and it will get the static JSON file containing version and platform information for the update (at this point the app prompts to update).\r\n3. Confirm you would like to update.\r\n4. Confirm to restart the application (this triggers the error).\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the application to restart successfully and apply the update.\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```text\r\n\r\nMacOS Monterey\r\nversion 12.3\r\n\r\n> tauri info\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Mac OS 12.3.0 X64\r\n  › Node.js: 18.12.1\r\n  › npm: 8.19.2\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.19\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.1\r\n  › rustc: 1.65.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.65.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-aarch64-apple-darwin \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.2.3\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.2.0\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.2.1,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.2.1,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.15.6,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.22.5,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › framework: React\r\n  › bundler: Vite\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ ui\r\n  ├─ tauri\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ tests\r\n  ├─ .github\r\n  ├─ .git\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n```text\r\n__pthread_deallocate\r\nthread 'tokio-runtime-worker' panicked at 'application failed to start: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" }'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI saw this [issue here](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4500) regarding setting a tmp dir for Linux, so maybe it's related. However, I'm using Mac for now.\r\n\r\nAlso, the build process generates a tar.gz called <app_name>.app.tar.gz, detailed [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/updater/#update-artifacts)\r\n\r\nHowever this line of code in the core.rs indicates that the tar.gz MUST have the arch, even though tauri only generates the .dmg with the version and the arch, and not the tar.gz:\r\nhttps://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/076e1a81a50468e3dfb34ae9ca7e77c5e1758daa/core/tauri/src/updater/core.rs#L832\r\n```\r\n// MacOS\r\n// ### Expected structure:\r\n// ├── [AppName]_[version]_x64.app.tar.gz       # GZ generated by tauri-bundler\r\n// │   └──[AppName].app                         # Main application\r\n// │      └── Contents                          # Application contents...\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould this be related to by it's giving a Not Found error?\r\n\r\nThe logs show that it successfully got the tar.gz:\r\n```\r\n[2023-06-08][20:59:16][attohttpc][DEBUG] GET /<updater>.json HTTP/1.1\r\n[2023-06-08][20:59:16][attohttpc][DEBUG] creating a length body

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nCross-platform compilation does not work:  \r\n```bash\r\ncargo tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script keeps giving an error:\r\n```bash\r\nwarning 5202: -OUTPUTCHARSET is disabled for non Win32 platforms.\r\n    Error failed to bundle project:\r\n    - `Invalid cross-device link (os error 18)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n0. Linux debian:bookworm-slim\r\n\r\n1. Create a fresh project as discribed here https://v2.tauri.app/start/create-project/\r\n2. Install required packages as described here https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#1-system-dependencies and here https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/cross-platform#experimental-build-windows-apps-on-linux-and-macos\r\n3.

The Linux build runs correctly and works as expected, which is great\r\n2. I am using rust 1.80.1 and also checked manually, that `TMPDIR=/var/tmp` (as was discussed here - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4500).
