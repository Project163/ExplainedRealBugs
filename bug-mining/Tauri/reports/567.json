All subsequent windows do not receive any events.\r\n\r\nIn this video, the same Tauri app runs on Windows on the left and Linux on the right.\r\n\r\nEvery window ran `listen(\"reply\", (event) => {alert(event.payload})})`.\r\nWhen the button is pressed, a Rust Tauri command is invoked, which emits the `reply` event.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, the app behaves correctly and every window receives the `reply` event.\r\n\r\nOn Linux, only the first window ever receives any events.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c0fd72-d7b8-4764-a92d-f82a2dd9af7b\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe example shown in the video: https://github.com/Ynng/tauri-listen-test\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n- Clone the tauri repo on an Ubuntu 24 machine\r\n- Run `cargo run --example multiwindow`\r\n- Try to send a message to the second/third window\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll windows should receive events that are \"emitted to all targets\".\r\n\r\n### Full `tauri info` output\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Fedora 40.0.0 x86_64 (X64)\r\n    ✔ webkit2gtk-4.1: 2.44.3\r\n    ✔ rsvg2: 2.57.1\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.80.1 (3f5fd8dd4 2024-08-06)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.80.1 (376290515 2024-07-16)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (environment override by RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN)\r\n    - node: 21.7.2\r\n    - pnpm: 9.7.1\r\n    - npm: 10.5.0\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri 🦀: 2.0.0-rc.11\r\n    - tauri-build 🦀: 2.0.0-rc.13\r\n    - wry 🦀: 0.44.1\r\n    - tao 🦀: 0.30.2\r\n    - tauri-cli 🦀: 2.0.0-rc.10\r\n\r\n[-] Plugins\r\n    - tauri-plugin-shell 🦀: 2.0.0-rc.0\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nUndoing #11043 fixes this problem, but re-introduces #10981","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
