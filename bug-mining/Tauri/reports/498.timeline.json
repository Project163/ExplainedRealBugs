After making sure I could manually sign with `signtool.exe`, I modified the existing properties in `tauri.bundle.windows` of the config to match the certificate on my YubiKey. It initially failed the build because the `tsp` property was missing, so I set it to `true` and the build succeeded. There was one annoyance of being prompted for my pin multiple times, but I'm looking into a few solutions for that. One related suggestion was to provide the password with a [special syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17927895/automate-extended-validation-ev-code-signing-with-safenet-etoken/54439759#54439759) as a parameter passed to `signtool.exe`, but that is for SafeNet eTokens, not YubiKeys and I'm not sure what the correct parameters should be for the YubiKey (if it's even possible). There is also the risk of being forced to factory reset the YubiKey if invalid credentials are entered too many times in a row, so experimenting with that will require a BIOS update level of concentration. \r\n\r\nBut if something like that works, it may be helpful for `tauri.bundle.windows` to have some extra properties for `/k` and `/csp` if nothing else. Also, maybe `tauri.bundle.windows.tsp` should be set to true in the default config? I'm not sure why someone would want that set to false.\r\n\r\nI hope this info helps. I'm very interested in this feature and want to help as much as I can.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/2054066453/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FlippingBinary","id":35066367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDY2MzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35066367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary","html_url":"https://github.com/FlippingBinary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlippingBinary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12918101825,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC7lts85oi4cbzwAAAAMB-pdB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/12918101825","actor":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"88c0ae9ef855b9c282413430e491f10205d96e3a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/commits/88c0ae9ef855b9c282413430e491f10205d96e3a","created_at":"2024-05-24T03:30:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-24T03:31:14Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T03:31:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9865","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9865/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9865/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9865/events","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/9865","id":2314266426,"node_id":"PR_kwDOC7lts85wZ1bw","number":9865,"title":"feat(bundler):
