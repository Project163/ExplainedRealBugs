When code signing and then distributing the app, I get crash reports on boot regarding the Framework and it having discrepancies in the team id \r\n\r\n```\r\nNot valid for use in process: mapping process and mapped file (non-platform) have different Team IDs\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring my testing and research today, I found that Apple recommends signing included frameworks along with your app itself. So I tried this on the `.app` file, first signing the internal Framework and then signing the overall App itself and it cleared up the issue.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is something that needs to be added to the bundler?\n\n### Reproduction\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Mac OS 13.2.1 X64\r\n    ✔ Xcode Command Line Tools: installed\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.70.0 (90c541806 2023-05-31)\r\n    ✔ Cargo: 1.70.0 (ec8a8a0ca 2023-04-25)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-aarch64-apple-darwin (environment override by RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN)\r\n    - node: 18.15.0\r\n    - yarn: 1.22.19\r\n    - npm: 9.5.0\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 1.4.1 (no manifest)\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 1.4.0 (no manifest)\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.24.3 (no manifest)\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.16.2 (no manifest)\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.4.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.4.0\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: style-src 'unsafe-inline' 'self'; default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' asset: https://asset.localhost; connect-src 'self' asset: https://asset.localhost\r\n    - distDir: ../dist\r\n    - devPath: http://localhost:3010/\r\n    - framework: React\r\n    - bundler: Vite\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7690/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
