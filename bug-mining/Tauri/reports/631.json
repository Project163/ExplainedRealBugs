This could possibly be done through a global event that can be listened for, but there should also be a way to disable the default behavior for it. There could also be a way to register a handler while initializing Tauri.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThis could also be done by giving Tauri a way to manage the custom browser history, and telling the frontend or backend when the back/forward browser events are triggered. This could also be managed through the developer's frontend framework of choice, but it might require a refactor if the app framework isn't already using custom routing or separate browser pages.\n\n### Additional context\n\n[The Discord support thread that prompted this feature request](https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1167318179043868772)","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8142/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
