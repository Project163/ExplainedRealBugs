Unfortunately, I'm not sure what the proper method of creating a WindowConfig from a JSON file is; I could be overlooking it, but I don't think the docs tell you how, and I haven't dug through the Tauri source to see how it's being done for the default Tauri config file. Putting window definitions in the `app.windows` field in the main Tauri config file obviously isn't an option either, because Tauri will immediately launch every window defined in that field, with no way to delay that process until later.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine adding a boolean field to the window config definition, like `deferCreation`, which allows you to define a window without Tauri launching it until asked. This would also let you access the WindowConfig instances Tauri itself generates from the config file and stores in `app.config().app.windows`. Unfortunately, even if you could do this, the current API for launching a window from Tauri's own config isn't too desirable. From the WebviewWindowBuilder docs [example](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0-rc.11/tauri/webview/struct.WebviewWindowBuilder.html#method.from_config):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet webview_window = tauri::WebviewWindowBuilder::from_config(&app, &app.config().app.windows.get(0).unwrap().clone())\r\n    .unwrap()\r\n    .build()\r\n    .unwrap();\r\n```\r\nSetting aside the rather noisy call, relative to the simplicity of the task, the crucial part here that defines which window is created is `.get(0)`, which is not very suggestive of which window is being launched, and is fairly fragile in the case that the window array gets reordered in the config file. Additionally, this API doesn't *seem* to let you define a label for the window, unlike the `WebviewWindowBuilder::new()` function, [which does](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0-rc.11/tauri/webview/struct.WebviewWindowBuilder.html#method.new). I'm therefore uncertain how this interacts with the permission system, which I think is supposed to be defined per-window, according to the window label (though I might be misunderstanding this).\r\n\r\nTo pursue that point: `WindowConfig`'s docs indicate the presence of a `label` field, but I've never seen this used in a Tauri config file. The `WebviewWindowBuilder::from_config` docs state [the following](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0-rc.11/tauri/webview/struct.WebviewWindowBuilder.html#method.from_config):\r\n> Initializes a webview window builder from a [WindowConfig](https://docs.rs/tauri-utils/2.0.0-rc.11/tauri_utils/config/struct.WindowConfig.html) from tauri.conf.json. Keep in mind that you can’t create 2 windows with the same label so make sure that the initial window was closed or change the label of the new [WebviewWindowBuilder](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0-rc.11/tauri/webview/struct.WebviewWindowBuilder.html).\r\n\r\nIt's not clear how the \"initial window\" gets its label—I'm assuming Tauri just sets it to `\"main\"` by itself, but I don't know what happens to windows defined in the config beyond the first. Presumably if you tried to create a new window as in the code sample above, it would implicitly receive the label `\"main\"`, and all the permissions defined for it.\r\n\r\n(Is there a reason that the config file defines window definitions in an array, instead of a dict keyed to each window's label? That seems like it would be an improvement in a few regards.)\r\n\r\nOverall, there's a bit of a mess in store for anyone who wants to launch the initial window(s) from their own Rust code while still using a JSON file to define the window configuration. I just caved and redefined everything again in code, even though this isn't ideal.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/2342672232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ConnorKrammer","id":1044441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1044441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer","html_url":"https://github.com/ConnorKrammer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConnorKrammer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/2344932294","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10950#issuecomment-2344932294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10950","id":2344932294,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts86LxNPG","user":{"login":"martpie","id":1311607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTE2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1311607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie","html_url":"https://github.com/martpie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martpie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-11T23:19:34Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T23:19:34Z","body":"I think creating a window manually instead of defining it in the conf file.

Although I would not call the property `deferCreation` because that does not unambiguously express what the property is supposed to do.
