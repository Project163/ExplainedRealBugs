Describe the bug\n\nThis issue probably reopened this one (https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8519), also look at the recent comments for additional context.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1.  `pnpm create tauri-app`\r\n2. Duplicate code from [here](https://v2.tauri.app/learn/window-customization/#creating-a-custom-titlebar)  and update permissions\r\n3. Change `tauri.conf.json`\r\n```\r\n\"windows\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"title\": \"resize-bug\",\r\n        \"width\": 800,\r\n        \"height\": 600,\r\n        \"decorations\": false,\r\n        \"transparent\": true,\r\n        \"shadow\": false\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n```\r\n4. Now if you run `pnpm tauri dev` resize will work.\r\n5. Update `Cargo.toml`\r\n```\r\ntauri = { version = \"2\", features = [\"unstable\"] }\r\n```\r\n6. Now resize doesn't work.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe application is able to be resize when \"unstable\" feature is enabled and \"decorations\": false.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.19045 x86_64 (X64)\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 128.0.2739.67\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.79.0 (129f3b996 2024-06-10)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.79.0 (ffa9cf99a 2024-06-03)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)\r\n    - node: 20.15.0\r\n    - pnpm: 9.5.0\r\n    - npm: 10.7.0\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri 🦀: 2.2.0\r\n    - tauri-build 🦀: 2.0.4\r\n    - wry 🦀: 0.48.0\r\n    - tao 🦀: 0.31.1\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api : 2.2.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli : 2.2.2\r\n\r\n[-] Plugins\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - bundler: Vite\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
