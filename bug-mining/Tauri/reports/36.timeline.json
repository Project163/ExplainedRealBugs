Describe the bug\n\n#2901 was closed years ago, but I'm seeing it now.\r\n\r\nOn Mac OS, these listeners are never invoked:\r\n```rs\r\n        .on_page_load(|window, _payload| {\r\n            window.listen(\"tauri://file-drop-hover\", |event| { dbg!(event); });\r\n            window.listen(\"tauri://file-drop\", |event| { dbg!(event); });\r\n            window.listen(\"tauri://file-drop-cancelled\", |event| { dbg!(event); });\r\n            dbg!(\"Listening...\");\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n\r\n`dbg!()` is working correctly because I see on stderr:\r\n```\r\n[src/main.rs:10] \"Listening...\" = \"Listening...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut nothing gets printed to stderr when I drag files into the window.\r\n\r\nJavascript receives the events fine. \n\n### Reproduction\n\nMinimal sample code:\r\nhttps://github.com/surferjeff/scratch/tree/main/tauri-drop\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm ci\r\nnpm run tauri dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nDrag and drop a file into the application's main window.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen dragging files into the main window, I expect to see events printed to stderr in the console.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n%  npm run tauri info\r\n\r\n> tauri-drop@0.0.0 tauri\r\n> tauri info\r\n\r\n\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Mac OS 13.6.7 X64\r\n    ✔ Xcode Command Line Tools: installed\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.70.0
