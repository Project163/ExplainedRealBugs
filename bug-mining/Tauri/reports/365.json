We should use crate `image` for the transformation.\r\n\r\nOr just simply add a assert here, outputting some friendly information if the icon is not RGBA.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```text\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Debian 11 X64\r\n  › Node.js: 16.19.1\r\n  › npm: 8.19.3\r\n  › pnpm: 7.26.2\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.19\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.2\r\n  › rustc: 1.67.1\r\n  › cargo: 1.67.1\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.2.3\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"wusyong","id":8409985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8409985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong","html_url":"https://github.com/wusyong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wusyong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6706/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
