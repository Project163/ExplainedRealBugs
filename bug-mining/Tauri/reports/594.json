And it is recommended to use npm-scopes. But it seems that the only supported scope is `@tauri-apps`.\r\n\r\nI guess some good and often used community plugins are manually moved to `@tauri-apps` \r\nSo the default way is to perform manual steps for community plugins and calling `cargo add ...` and `npm install ...` instead of `npm run tauri add...`\r\n\r\nIs this correct (just asking)?\r\n\r\nEdit: \r\n\r\n**Reproduction**\r\nRun `npm run tauri add tauri-plugin-python` or another community plugin. It is always trying to use an npm package fro `@tauri-apps/...` \r\nTherefore, it is required to perform manual steps instead of just performing `tauri add` to add community plugins. This needs to be documented.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAdding additional parameter `--community` so that community plugins can also be added via `npm run tauri add ... --community` which performs the same steps for community plugins as for official ones.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
