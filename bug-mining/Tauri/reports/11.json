installed `tauri-cli` via cargo:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo install tauri-cli --version 1.0.0-beta.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last line of the install reads as follows:\r\n```\r\nInstalled package `tauri-cli v1.0.0-beta.5` (executable `cargo-tauri`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaturally, I tried this new executable, but was left scratching my head:\r\n```\r\n$ cargo-tauri --help\r\ncargo-tauri 1.0.0-beta.5\r\nLucas Nogueira <lucas@tauri.studio>\r\nThe Tauri command line interface.\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n    cargo <SUBCOMMAND>\r\n\r\nFLAGS:\r\n    -h, --help       Prints help information\r\n    -V, --version    Prints version information\r\n\r\nSUBCOMMANDS:\r\n    help     Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\r\n    tauri    Tauri CLI\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn't think `tauri` was the subcommand I was looking for, because I wanted to `init` a new project. lol.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think the `cargo-tauri` command should self-document that its intended usage is through `cargo tauri`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cargo tauri help\r\ncargo-tauri 1.0.0-beta.5\r\nTauri CLI\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n    cargo tauri [SUBCOMMAND]\r\n\r\nFLAGS:\r\n    -h, --help       Prints help information\r\n    -V, --version    Prints

information about Tauri dependencies\r\n    init     Initializes a Tauri project\r\n    sign     Tauri updates signer.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMuch better!
