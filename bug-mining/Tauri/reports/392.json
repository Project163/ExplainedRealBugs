Describe the bug\n\nI need to develop an application for Windows that ships with a fixed version of the WebView2 runtime.\r\nI followed the instructions provided in the [docs](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/windows#fixed-version): downloaded the latest version, unzipped it, and updated the tauri.conf.json file accordingly.\r\nThe production application (generated with `npm run tauri build`) works flawlessly.\r\nHowever, **in development (`npm run tauri dev`) the application crashes during bootstrap due to the following error:**\r\n```sh\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'error while running application: Runtime(CreateWebview(WebView2Error(WindowsError(Error { code: 0x80070002, message: The system cannot find the file specified. }))))'\r\n```\r\nThis is really strange. It looks like, during development, Tauri is unable to find the correct directory (maybe a working directory issue?) where the runtime is located.\r\nIf I change the configuration to not use a Fixed runtime, the application starts without any problem.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/carlocorradini/tauri-webview\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTauri should find the WebView runtime and start without any error.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.19045 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 114.0.1823.67\r\n    ✔ MSVC:\r\n        - Visual Studio Build Tools 2019\r\n        - Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.70.0 (90c541806 2023-05-31)\r\n    ✔ Cargo: 1.70.0 (ec8a8a0ca 2023-04-25)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)\r\n    - node: 18.16.0\r\n    - npm: 9.5.1\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 1.4.0 (no manifest)\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 1.4.0 (no manifest)\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.24.3 (no manifest)\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.16.2 (no manifest)\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.4.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.4.0\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - distDir: ../build\r\n    - devPath: http://localhost:5173/\r\n    - framework: Svelte\r\n    - bundler: Vite\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nMaybe: Windows only related","closed_by":{"login":"FabianLars","id":30730186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMwMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30730186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars","html_url":"https://github.com/FabianLars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
