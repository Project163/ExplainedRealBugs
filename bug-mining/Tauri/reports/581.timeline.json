Describe the problem\n\nCurrently, on Windows, all app windows created by tauri have the same class named \"Window Class\", it would be neet to allow for customization of the Windows' window class name.\r\n\r\nOne use case: some windows custom hotkey managers leverage window class names to select windows...\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to add a WindowConfig option called `window_classname`. Default should still be \"Window Class\" : it would be a non-breaking change :)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNo alternative, unless simply dumping those tools and find one using other characteristics of windows...\n\n### Additional context\n\nI have patched it on my side and want to contribute it to the upstream project.\r\nIt does depend on a new feature on Tao / winit side. Here are the correponding PRs:\r\n- winit : https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2978 \r\n  Status : All 55 checks passed, waiting for merge\r\n- tao : https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/pull/770\r\n  Status : waiting for merge\r\n\r\nThis issue is a mirror of #7498 but dedicate to the version 1 of

to customize it instead of current value hard coded \"Window Class\" for all Tauri windows...\r\n\r\nFrom #7498 : Currently, on Windows, all app windows created by tauri have the same class named \"Window Class\", it would be neet to allow for customization of the Windows' window class name.\r\n\r\nOne use case: some windows custom hotkey managers leverage window class names to select windows...\r\n\r\nNon breaking, since the default value passed corresponds to the previous value that was hard-coded.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nUpdate \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to

 Default should still be \"Window Class\" \r\n\r\nStrongly disagree; I was going to file a separate issue, but as someone who doesn't use Tauri or Rust, the mandatory template is oppressive.\r\n\r\nI make an app that interacts with windows from any app or framework; when I see \"Window Class\" in logs/issues, it tells me nothing - a window class of \"Window Class\" is meaningless in the context of the win32 `GetClassName()` function, or multiple win32 apps more broadly.\r\n\r\nIf you want a fixed window class string is necessary, perhaps \"Tauri Window\"?\r\n\r\nIf you're happy with a non-fixed
