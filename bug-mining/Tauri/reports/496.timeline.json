I use api.prevent_close() and window.hide() to prevent the app to exit. And then I want to show the window again by left-clicking the icon on the dock, but it does happen. The question is how to capture the left-click events?\r\n\r\nThis may not close the issue as it's not about capturing left click on dock events. So obviously this isn't the solution you've described as the one you'd like, but _I think_ I have implemented the behaviour you've described.\r\n\r\nI've got an app which needs to stay running when the window is closed as we have some long running processes. A bit like docker desktop. On MacOS we want the app to stay in the dock, and the window to reappear if the item in the dock is left clicked.\r\n\r\nOn Windows we don't want the application to be visible on the menu bar unless the window is open, as we have a system tray icon instead, so our logic differs slightly:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  tauri::Builder::default()\r\n    .on_window_event(|event| match event.event() {\r\n      tauri::WindowEvent::CloseRequested { api, .. } => {\r\n        #[cfg(not(target_os = \"macos\"))] {\r\n          event.window().hide().unwrap();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        #[cfg(target_os = \"macos\")] {\r\n          tauri::AppHandle::hide(&event.window().app_handle()).unwrap();\r\n        }\r\n        api.prevent_close();\r\n      }\r\n      _ => {}\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nExcuse the 'unwrap's - It's easier to show them here for brevity, but longer term I'd suggest doing something like mapping them and handling the errors.\r\n\r\nI've found that this hiding was enough, as the other events appear to be handled by default in a satisfactory manner. I don't try to manually 'show' the window (except if prompted via our system tray)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1477675840/reactions","total_count":45,"+1":27,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":8,"confused":0,"heart":8,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MGough","id":6558104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTgxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6558104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough","html_url":"https://github.com/MGough","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGough/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1525503281","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3084#issuecomment-1525503281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3084","id":1525503281,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85a7VUx","user":{"login":"ngalaiko","id":15010292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEwMjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15010292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko","html_url":"https://github.com/ngalaiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngalaiko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-27T11:11:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T11:11:27Z","body":"@MGough thanks!! for some reason, indeed if I use `tauri::AppHandle::hide` it works as expected on MacOS.

Describe the problem\n\nElectron supports an activate event (macOS-specific), triggered for example when calling the app from the doc or spotlight.\r\n\r\n> Emitted when the application is activated. Various actions can trigger this event, such as launching the application for the first time, attempting to re-launch the application when it's already running, or clicking on the application's dock or taskbar icon.\r\n\r\nThis event is really useful when, instead of destroying the window when user want to close it, we hide instead. In my case, I have an `<audio />` playing in the background I need to keep playing. So destroying the window is not a good solution, and minimizing the app instead of maximizing is slow and does not feel native.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAn app or window \"activate\" event that can be listened to (from the back-end at least).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
