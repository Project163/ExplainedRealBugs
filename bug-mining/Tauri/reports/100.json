Describe the bug\n\nWhen using the sidecar to execute long running sub commands, I try to receive new stdout events.\r\n\r\nFor that I wrote this code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet (mut rx, mut child) = cmd.spawn().expect(\"Failed to spawn sidecar\");\r\n\r\ntauri::async_runtime::spawn(async move {\r\n    // read events such as stdout\r\n    while let Some(event) = rx.recv().await {\r\n        if let CommandEvent::Stdout(line) = event {\r\n            debug!(\"{}\", line);\r\n            window.emit(\"upload-progress\", Payload {\r\n                message: line,\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    debug!(\"upload complete\");\r\n    window.emit(\"upload-complete\", {});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the future of `rx.recv()` is never resolved when spawning a command that clears its output before writing to it again (i.e. human readable progress in a terminal). It only resolves after the child process exited and then it dumps out all the lines at once.\r\n\r\nUsing a command that doesn't clear out before updating works fine and it _seems_ like, that it also works fine when the command clears out and writes multiple lines.\r\n\r\nI encountered that using the `rclone sync source:path target:path --progress --progress-terminal-title --stats-one-line` command.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Create an app\r\n2. Using sidecar, spawn a long running command that always clears stdout before writing to it\r\n3. Try to receive events from command\r\n4. `rx.recv().await` doesn't resolve\r\n5. Wait until command finsihed\r\n6. `rx.recv().await` resolved with the complete output\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`rx.recv().await` should resolve for every event during running command\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nOperating System - Mac OS, version 11.6.0 X64\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 16.13.0\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-rc.4\r\n  @tauri-apps/api - 1.0.0-rc.1\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 8.1.0\r\n  pnpm - Not installed\r\n  yarn - 1.22.10\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustup - 1.24.3\r\n  rustc - 1.58.1\r\n  cargo - 1.58.0\r\n  toolchain - stable-x86_64-apple-darwin \r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n/test\r\n/dist\r\n/node_modules\r\n/src-tauri\r\n/.git\r\n/.idea\r\n/src\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  tauri - 1.0.0-rc.2\r\n  tauri-build - 1.0.0-rc.2\r\n  tao - 0.6.2\r\n  wry - 0.13.1\r\n  build-type - bundle\r\n  CSP - default-src blob: data: filesystem: ws: wss: http: https: tauri: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self' img-src: 'self'\r\n  distDir - ../dist\r\n  devPath - http://local-desktop.syra.live:3000/\r\n  framework - React\r\n✨  Done in 9.42s.\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nDiscussion with @FabianLars about that here in discord: https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/731495047962558564/944267064175132732","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
