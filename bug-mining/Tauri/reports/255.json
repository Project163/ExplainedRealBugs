However, when attempting to pass command line arguments to `yarn tauri dev`, `cargo build` captures the arguments and terminates the environment launch.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. `yarn tauri dev -- test123` or `cargo-tauri dev -- test123` or `cargo tauri dev -- test123`\r\n2. `cargo build` incorrectly captures the arguments\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe arguments should be passed to the Tauri application and not captured by cargo.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n### OS\r\n- Windows\r\n- Linux-based distros\r\n\r\n### Command line environments\r\n- PowerShell\r\n- cmd.exe\r\n- git-bash\r\n- bash\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n- `yarn tauri dev -- test123`\r\n- `cargo-tauri dev -- test123`\r\n- `cargo tauri dev -- test123`\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nyarn 1.22.19\r\nyarn-run-tauri 1.0.5\r\ntauri-cli 1.0.5\r\ncargo-tauri 1.0.5\r\nrustc 1.63.0 (4b91a6ea7 2022-08-08)\n\n### Stack trace\n\n```shell\nPS C:\\Users\\sergix\\dev\\cps310\\cps310-simulator-Sergix> yarn tauri dev -- test123\r\nyarn run v1.22.19\r\n$ [redacted]\\node_modules\\.bin\\tauri dev test123\r\n     Running BeforeDevCommand (`yarn start`)\r\n        Info Watching [redacted]\\src-tauri for changes...\r\nerror: Found argument 'test123' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n    cargo.exe build [OPTIONS]  \r\n\r\nFor more information try --help\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\r\ninfo Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt would be helpful for the Tauri docs to be more clear on this behavior since nothing about passing arguments is listed on [the CLI docs page.](https://tauri.app/v1/api/cli#dev)","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5079/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
