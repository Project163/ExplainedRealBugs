So we know it is only an issue when supplying a byte array as `file`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe file should have mime type of `image/png`\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nLinux (Ubuntu 20.04, Centos 7, Windows 10)\r\n\r\n[build-dependencies]\r\ntauri-build = { version = \"1.0.0-rc.12\", features = [] }\r\n\r\n[dependencies]\r\ntauri = { version = \"1.0.0-rc.14\", features = [\"fs-read-file\", \"fs-write-file\", \"http-all\", \"http-multipart\", \"shell-open\"] }\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nI tried adding `reqwest-client` but that resulted in it completely not uploading at all with my server rejecting:\r\n\r\n> org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUploadException: the request was rejected because no multipart boundary was found","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
