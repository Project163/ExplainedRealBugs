Something like\r\n```\r\nyarn tauri icon target-icon.png --ouput icons --config icons/config.json\r\n```\r\nThe configuration for generating icons is currently hardcoded. So, a json format is needed, as I was suggested above:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"folder\": \"../frontend/src/assets/icons\",\r\n    \"name\": \"icon-{}.png\", // would be icon-72x72.png for example.\r\n    \"sizes\": [72, 96, 128, 144, 152, 192, 384, 512]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nAnd of course, there'll be default configs if user don't want to customize anything.

Here again, all these sizes need to stay, and the order is important too (32 must be before 16 and 24 so it's the first layer)\r\n\r\n> Is @2x necessary?\r\n\r\nYes, because it's the 128px icon for high dpi mode.

Otherwise the general approach (that i like) seems to be to first try to explore the basics of the topic in the issue, and then if you have some kind of PoC implementation, create a draft PR and move the discussion about specifics over there and only report back major things in the issue to not annoy issue subscribers 😅\r\nBut in the end it really doesn't matter too much, it's more about what
