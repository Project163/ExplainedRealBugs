I get the following error from cargo\r\n```\r\n    Updating crates.io index\r\n  Installing tauri-cli v1.1.1\r\nerror: failed to compile `tauri-cli v1.1.1`, intermediate artifacts can be found at `/Users/toasty/.cargo-target`\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  failed to select a version for the requirement `serde_with = \"^2.0\"`\r\n  candidate versions found which didn't match: 1.14.0, 1.13.0, 1.12.1, ...\r\n  location searched: crates.io index\r\n  required by package `tauri-cli v1.1.1`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same command works fine on linux. Also serde_with has a version 2.0.1 published on crates.io so this may be a cargo bug. https://crates.io/crates/serde_with\r\nI have tried removing the index directory manually but that did not help.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Have rust 1.59\r\n2. run `cargo install tauri-cli`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCargo installs tauri-cli\n\n### Platform and versions\n\nmacOS Monterey 12.6\r\nrustc 1.59.0 (9d1b2106e 2022-02-23)\r\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n```shell\nNone\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nupdating to 1.64 fixed the issue\r\n\r\nWe should update rust version for cli to 1.60 as this is what serde_with uses.
