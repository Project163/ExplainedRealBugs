Describe the problem\n\nI'm new to Tauri and was attempting to run the template (yarn + react).\r\nBecause I was running an older version of Cargo, the build failed, but because the rust build output gets replaced by the yarn build, the issue wasn't easy to work out.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIdeally, if the 'edition' in Cargo.toml is too new, the yarn build wouldn't get run, so that you could see the error in the output.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No
