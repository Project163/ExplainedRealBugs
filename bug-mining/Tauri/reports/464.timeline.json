don't think that is a requirement it's just I have a separate library)\r\n3) In that same crate I added the build script and things to build up permissions automatically.\r\nMore specific:\r\n\r\nI have a file in my cy3 crate, in cy3/back/tauri_plugin_scada.rs containing plugin interface, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n... some more use for me ...\r\nuse tauri::{\r\n    plugin::{Builder, TauriPlugin},\r\n    Runtime,\r\n};\r\n... some use from my crate...\r\n\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nfn initialize() {}\r\n\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn add_alias(\r\n    state: tauri::State<'_, ScadaManager>,\r\n    alias: String,\r\n    path: String,\r\n) -> Result<(), Error> {\r\n    state.add_alias(alias, path).await\r\n}\r\n\r\n... some more command functions defined ...\r\n\r\npub fn init<R: Runtime>() -> TauriPlugin<R> {\r\n    Builder::new(\"scada\")\r\n        .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![\r\n            initialize,\r\n            add_alias,\r\n... some more command functions listed...\r\n        ])\r\n        .build()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the name of plugin is \"scada\" as you see in init function.\r\n\r\nThen I added a \"build.rs\" file in cy3/build.rs containing:\r\n\r\n```\r\npub fn main() {\r\n    tauri_plugin::Builder::new(&[\r\n        \"add_alias\",\r\n... some more command names listed (named exactly as the functions of previous file)...\r\n    ])\r\n    .build();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen some important bits are in cy3/Cargo.toml:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[package]\r\nname    = \"cy3\"\r\n... some more usual version / edition things ...\r\n# This gives name to tauri plugin, don't know how\r\nlinks   = \"scada\"\r\n\r\n[dependencies]\r\n... my own dependencies not related to tauri ...\r\ntauri               = \"2.0.0-beta\"\r\n\r\n[build-dependencies]\r\ntauri-plugin        = { version = \"2.0.0-beta\", features = [\"build\"] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere you see you need to add the build dependency (that is required in build.rs) and that bit of black magic: the \"links\" keyword.\r\nActually the supposed use for this key (see rust book) is related to linking libraries to your project, but tauri use that keyword to pass the plugin name information here and there (if I understood well, it's for the build script pass).\r\n\r\nSo that's all you need on your plugin side.\r\nWhen you build it, you'll see the permission directory (cy3/permissions) being created magically (actually the build.rs file does it, dig tauri source a bit to see); \r\n\r\nThen, in the application you want to use the plugin:\r\n1) You import your crate as a dependency in Cargo.toml\r\n2) You add permission to use your commands in the \"capabilities\" directory\r\n\r\nSpecifically in my case, my app is named usv5, so in usv5/src-tauri/Cargo.toml:\r\n\r\n```\r\n... various things ...\r\n\r\n[build-dependencies]\r\ntauri-build = { version = \"2.0.0-beta\", features = [] }\r\n\r\n[dependencies]\r\ntauri = { version = \"2.0.0-beta\", features = [] }\r\n... more dependencies ...\r\ncy3 = { path = \"../../cy3\" }\r\n\r\n[features]\r\n# this feature is used for production builds or when `devPath` points to the filesystem\r\n# DO NOT REMOVE!!\r\ncustom-protocol = [\"tauri/custom-protocol\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn usv5/package.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"usv5\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"type\": \"module\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"dev\": \"vite\",\r\n    \"build\": \"tsc && vite build\",\r\n    \"preview\": \"vite preview\",\r\n    \"tauri\": \"tauri\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@tauri-apps/api\": \"^2.0.0-beta.0\",\r\n    \"@tauri-apps/plugin-fs\": \"^2.0.0-beta.0\",\r\n    \"handlebars\": \"^4.7.8\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@tauri-apps/cli\": \"^2.0.0-beta.1\",\r\n    \"@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin\": \"^6.4.0\",\r\n    \"eslint\": \"^8.56.0\",\r\n    \"eslint-config-standard-with-typescript\": \"^43.0.1\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-import\": \"^2.25.2\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-n\": \"^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0 \",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-promise\": \"^6.0.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.0.2\",\r\n    \"vite\": \"^5.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(nothing exactly related to plugin there, only tauri deps)\r\n\r\nIn usv5/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"beforeBuildCommand\": \"pnpm build\",\r\n    \"beforeDevCommand\": \"pnpm dev\",\r\n    \"devUrl\": \"http://localhost:1420\",\r\n    \"frontendDist\": \"../dist\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"productName\": \"usv5\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"plugins\": {\r\n    \"shell\": {\r\n      \"open\": true\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"app\": {\r\n    \"security\": {\r\n      \"csp\": null\r\n    },\r\n    \"windows\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"fullscreen\": false,\r\n        \"height\": 600,\r\n        \"resizable\": true,\r\n        \"title\": \"usv5\",\r\n        \"width\": 800\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"identifier\": \"com.unioncontrolli.usv5\",\r\n  \"bundle\": {\r\n    \"active\": true,\r\n    \"icon\": [\r\n      \"icons/32x32.png\",\r\n      \"icons/128x128.png\",\r\n      \"icons/128x128@2x.png\",\r\n      \"icons/icon.icns\",\r\n      \"icons/icon.ico\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"targets\": \"all\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(nothing related to plugin there, but I had to manually edit that thing because things changed in-between alpha and beta)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the usv5/capabilities/main.json file I added all of my plugin capabilities in the \"permissions\" array, as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    \"scada:allow-add-alias\",\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to debug capabilities names, a simple way is to add in that main.json some wrong capabilities, like\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"this:does-not-exist\",\r\n```\r\nand in build you'll get a debug where all existent capabilities are listed. That may help to get the exact name you have.\r\n\r\nNote that my plugin name is \"scada\", not \"cy3\", so is not related to my library crate name.\r\n\r\nTo call your plugin then you use in your js/ts scripts:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { invoke } from \"@tauri-apps/api/core\";\r\n\r\n... whatever ...\r\n\r\n\t\treturn await invoke('plugin:scada|add_alias',\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\talias: alias,\r\n\t\t\t\tpath: path\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps!
