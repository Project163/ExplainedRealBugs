The problem here is that if you built you app on an older version than 2204 (which you should), it won't run correctly on distros/distro-versions with openssl@v3.\r\nThis is only an issue if you use tauri's http apis (as in: you have it on your allowlist) or if you have the updater enabled.\r\n\r\nWe basically have 2 ways to go here:\r\n1) Switch to rustls, this should be a problem audit wise and it doesn't cover all of openssl, so this may introduce new problems.\r\n2) vendor openssl (=include it with the app), problems with that are:\r\n    1) attohttpc doesn't have that option yet (the alternative reqwest client does)\r\n    2) bigger bundle size\r\n    3) it needs more build dependencies (namingly `perl`, the rest of the deps should be covered by tauri's deps)\r\n    4) **The app's

which is just a slight variation of the one in the usage example.\r\n\r\nAfter the action runs for all platforms, the artifacts can be downloaded from the repository \"releases\" page, but:\r\n\r\n1- The downloadable for Ubuntu ( ollama-grid-search_0.0.0_amd64.deb ) installs, but nothing happens when you run it, like it quits immediately... the appimage version runs fine, though.\r\n\r\nMore info:\r\n- The app runs if I manually build it on my local machine (Ubuntu 22.04)\r\n- The appimage file size is 72 Mb (and pretty close to the runable binary), but the deb file is only 4.5Mb (not sure if that matters)\r\n- Haven't tested the windows or mac installs yet.\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate any help and instructions in case I am missing something here.
