I'm on an ARM Mac (M1 Air).\r\nI've created a repo with info and easy reproduction steps in the readme: https://github.com/SamLewis0602/tauri-repro\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n### To reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/SamLewis0602/tauri-repro\r\n1. Use pyinstaller to build `simple.py` (`pyinstaller -F simple.py`)\r\n1. Place binary in src-tauri/bin\r\n1. Append target triple (I'm on ARM mac so left my binary in there)\r\n1. Run `yarn tauri dev`, see app for command output\r\n1. Make any change to `simple.py` (change printed text or whatever)\r\n1. Repeat steps 3-5\r\n1. See that sidecar fails with signal 9\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTo be able to change the sidecar binary itself and still have it run in `yarn tauri dev`\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ tauri info\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Mac OS 12.3.0 X64\r\n  › Node.js: 16.13.1\r\n  › npm: 8.1.2\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.18\r\n  › rustup: 1.24.3\r\n  › rustc: 1.60.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.60.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-aarch64-apple-darwin \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.10\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.5\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.10,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.8,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.8.4,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.16.2,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../dist\r\n  › devPath: ../dist\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ dist\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ src-tauri\r\n  └─ .git\r\n✨  Done in 6.68s.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n- The binary still works normally when called from the terminal\r\n- The sidecar works in the prod build `yarn tauri build`\r\n- The sidecar only fails in dev `yarn tauri dev`\r\n\r\nIf I reboot my computer the binary will work again without changing the binary at all. It makes me wonder if it's somehow related to signing the binary?
