differ on different computers. I tried on another Win11 and it can handle a few more capabilities than the first Win11 I experimented with. \r\n\r\nFor example, doing any of the following will get rid of the stackoverflow error for me, but on your computer you may or may not need to remove a few more capabilities.\r\n\r\n### 1. Remove remote urls from `capabilities/ext.json`\r\n```json\r\n    \"remote\": {\r\n        \"urls\": [\r\n            \"http://localhost:1566/*\",\r\n            \"http://localhost:*\"\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Remove all fs permissions in  `capabilities/ext.json`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"fs:allow-exists\",\r\n\"fs:allow-stat\",\r\n\"fs:read-all\",\r\n\"fs:allow-mkdir\",\r\n\"fs:allow-app-write\",\r\n\"fs:allow-app-write-recursive\",\r\n\"fs:allow-appcache-write\",\r\n\"fs:allow-appcache-write-recursive\",\r\n\"fs:allow-appconfig-write\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Remove all permissions in `capabilities/main.json`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried to remove capabilities and plugins line by line to narrow down the cause but couldn't find a specific plugin causing this. They all work by themselves, but will stackoverflow when combined.\r\n\r\nI think this is simply because the stack is full. \r\nI am not familiar with very low level system programming, but from what I know Windows has a default 1MB stack size, Mac and Linux have 8MB stack size. I guess this is why.\r\n\r\nI have tried to increase stack size with env var and some other options but still couldn't get it working.\r\n\r\n```ps\r\nset RUSTFLAGS=-C link-args=/STACK:16777216\r\ncargo run\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/2132041864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HuakunShen","id":33727687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzI3Njg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33727687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen","html_url":"https://github.com/HuakunShen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuakunShen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12934737331,"node_id":"MEE_lADOC7lts86KHvqNzwAAAAMC-G2z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/12934737331","actor":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-26T03:00:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12934737334,"node_id":"SE_lADOC7lts86KHvqNzwAAAAMC-G22","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/12934737334","actor":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-26T03:00:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/2132088470","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9882#issuecomment-2132088470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9882","id":2132088470,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85_FRaW","user":{"login":"reyamir","id":123083837,"node_id":"U_kgDOB1YcPQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123083837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir","html_url":"https://github.com/reyamir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reyamir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-26T06:34:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-26T06:34:12Z","body"
