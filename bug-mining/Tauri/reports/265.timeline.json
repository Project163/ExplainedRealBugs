Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI'm trying to copy a file stored inside the app, but I couldn't find a way to achieve. I'm simply using Vite on a project, it basically imports any file into assets directory when I import a file with `?url` suffix.\r\n\r\nFor example, I can import the file like this:\r\n```ts\r\nimport fileZip from 'the/original/path/file.zip?url';\r\n// fileZip: \"/assets/file.b9be33fa.zip\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assumed that this path would be enough to use it with resolveResource and copy the file as I needed with the following code\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { copyFile, BaseDirectory } from '@tauri-apps/api/fs';\r\nimport { resolveResource } from '@tauri-apps/api/path';\r\nimport fileZip from 'the/original/path/file.zip?url';\r\n// fileZip: \"/assets/file.b9be33fa.zip\"\r\n\r\nconst resourcePath = await resolveResource(fileZip);\r\n// resourcePath: \"/Applications/Tempest.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/_root_/assets/file.b9be33fa.zip\"\r\n\r\nawait copyFile(resourcePath, 'file.zip', {\r\n  dir: BaseDirectory.Desktop,\r\n});\r\n// throws: \"cannot traverse directory, rewrite the path without the use of `../`\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nTo be honest, the easiest solution would be, a new or an existing API which could allow me to access the file like accessing a file on a host and run FS-related actions on it (i.e. copy).\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAs suggested in the help channel on [Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/625037620996734986/1020789104859947050), I have peeked at `app.asset_resolver().get(\"/abs/path/to/file\")` suggestion however, the solution that I need is in the JS environment.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No
