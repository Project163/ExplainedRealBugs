Please describe.**\r\nThe `App.create_window()` function takes a label as its first argument. This currently needs to be a `String` so I need to use `.into()` on every call to this function.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to be able to pass a `&str` label to the function without having to add `.into()`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI've [implemented this change on my fork](https://github.com/woubuc/tauri/commit/00aad69c8515496b031e829f423848a1fb8d0d41) to see how complicated it would be. All internal functions seem to already use `impl Into<String>` for labels, it's only the main public-facing function that is fixed on a `String`.\r\n\r\nChanging the type to `impl Into<String>` will cause `.into()` to stop working, so since this is the public-facing API this would constitute a breaking change and developers would need to update their uses of `app.create_window()` when updating their Tauri version. I reckon now is the time to make a usability change like this, since Tauri is still in beta.","closed_by":{"login":"lemarier","id":22237916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjM3OTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22237916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier","html_url":"https://github.com/lemarier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
