iOS and Android CLI commands leverage an android_studio_script/xcode_script that is executed by the native IDE or build tool. This script reads the Tauri configuration to find the app identifier used to communicate with the parent Tauri CLI process to read CLI options.\r\n\r\nThe communication is broken when the `--config` arg is used, since the IDE script does not have access to that value before reaching the parent process, which is impossible without knowing the actual identifier used.\r\n\r\nTo bypass this we'll agree on using the original identifier. This obviously won't work if the original tauri.conf.json do not have an identifier, so we error out in this case\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBefore submitting a PR, please read https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n\r\n1.
