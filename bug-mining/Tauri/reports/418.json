When launching, I get the notification for an update, pressing yes, a cmd terminal window appears and then the entire program closes.\r\n\r\nI've tried using msi instead and the problem disappeared. I'm also making appimage builds and that's working fine too. I don't know how to get any debug info why it's failing. I've tried different physical machines too all on windows 11. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/assets/8362329/6baeb760-07b2-441c-9db5-d4eaf29b2f41\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.22621 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 117.0.2045.43\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.72.1 (d5c2e9c34 2023-09-13)\r\n    ✔ Cargo: 1.72.1 (103a7ff2e 2023-08-15)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)\r\n    - node: 18.18.0\r\n    - yarn: 1.22.19\r\n    - npm: 9.8.1\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 1.5.0\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 1.5.0\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.24.4\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.16.3\r\n    - tauri-cli [RUST]: not installed!\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.5.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.5.0\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - distDir: ../dist\r\n    - devPath: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - framework: React\r\n    - bundler: Vite\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
