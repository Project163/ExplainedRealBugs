This results in the following error output when trying to build a signed bundle: \r\n```\r\ninfo: trying to sign app\r\ninfo: signing <binary>\r\ninfo: running signtool \"E:\\\\Windows Kits\\\\10\\\\bin\\\\10.0.19041.0\\\\x64\\\\signtool.exe\"\r\nError running CLI: failed to bundle project: failed to sign app: SignTool Error: The specified timestamp server either could not be reached or\r\nreturned an invalid response.\r\nSignTool Error: An error occurred while attempting to sign: <binary>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis functionality is possible in SignTool by using `/tr <timestamp URL>` and `/td <timestamp digest algorithm>` instead of `/t <timestamp URL>`. See an example of a SignTool command with `/tr` and `/td` [here](https://www.ssl.com/how-to/using-your-code-signing-certificate/#ftoc-heading-10). Tip: see SignTool's command options [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool).\r\n\r\nI suggest adding another configuration field called `tsp` or something along those lines under `Tauri > Bundle > Windows`, with the default value being `false` and with the option of `true`. The `true` value of the `tsp`-field would then result in the SignTool command including `/tr` and `/td` instead of `/t` to be compatible with a TSP (RFC 3161) timestamp server.\r\n\r\nAlso, as I read this it sounds a bit like a feature request rather than a bug so feel free to change it. However, I file this as a bug since the code-signing functionality doesn't work as expected from the documentation.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Have a code signing certificate (or not...?)\r\n2. Set timestamp server to `http://ts.ssl.com` or any other TSP server\r\n3. Try to build with `yarn tauri build` (or whatever build system you use)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nA successful, signed build of my app.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nOperating System - Windows, version 10.0.19044 X64\r\nWebview2 - 98.0.1108.62\r\nVisual Studio Build Tools:\r\n   - Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n   - Visual Studio Build Tools 2019\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 16.14.0\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-rc.4\r\n  @tauri-apps/api - 1.0.0-rc.1\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 8.3.1\r\n  pnpm - Not installed\r\n  yarn - 1.22.17\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustup - 1.24.3\r\n  rustc - 1.58.1\r\n  cargo - 1.58.0\r\n  toolchain - stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n/.git\r\n/.github\r\n/.idea\r\n/build\r\n/node_modules\r\n/public\r\n/src\r\n/src-tauri\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  tauri - 1.0.0-rc.2\r\n  tauri-build - 1.0.0-rc.2\r\n  tao - 0.6.1\r\n  wry - 0.13.1\r\n  build-type - bundle\r\n  CSP - default-src blob: data: filesystem: ws: wss: http: https: tauri: 'unsafe\r\n-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self' img-src: 'self'\r\n  distDir - ../build\r\n  devPath - http://localhost:6969/\r\n  framework - React\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
