However, Tauri doesn't respect this. Clicking on external links with `<base target=\"_blank\">` enabled just does nothing at all.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Mac OS 13.4.0 X64\r\n    ✔ Xcode Command Line Tools: installed\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.70.0 (90c541806 2023-05-31)\r\n    ✔ Cargo: 1.70.0 (ec8a8a0ca 2023-04-25)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-aarch64-apple-darwin (default)\r\n    - node: 16.18.0\r\n    - pnpm: 7.0.1\r\n    - yarn: 1.22.19\r\n    - npm: 8.19.2\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 1.2.4\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 1.2.1\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.23.4\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.15.8\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: not installed!\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.4.0\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - distDir: ../web-tauri\r\n    - devPath: http://localhost:3000/\r\n    - framework: React (Next.js)\r\n    - bundler: Webpack\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
