This issue has been upstreamed from https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6567 \n\n### Describe the problem\n\nMy application uses cookies/localStorage on the javascript side for various purposes.\r\n\r\nI don't see a clear way to clear all the stuff stored by the Webview engine. I could have the javascript side clear these, but there are things that this side can't clear like disk cache, etc\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI want to put a native button like 'Logout' that clears all this data. \r\n\r\nAn API on app/app_handle that clears this data might make sense. Maybe it needs to be part of exit or relaunch?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nI considered manually deleting some of the path_resolver() directories, but directories like `/Users/pttamkin/Library/HTTPStorage/{pkg}` and `/Users/pttamkin/Library/WebKit/{pkg}` aren't captured here. Also not sure I can delete these while my app is running?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No
