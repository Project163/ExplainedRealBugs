#11614\n\nRemove UNC manually, instead of `dunce::simplified` because `path` could have `*` in it and that's not allowed on Windows and `dunce::simplified` will check that and return `path` as is without simplification resulting in a missing pattern in scope\n\nfor the scope pattern `\\\\?\\C:\\path\\to\\dir\\**`, we expect the scope to have:\n- `\\\\?\\C:\\path\\to\\dir\\**`\n- `C:\\path\\to\\dir\\**`\n\nbut if we use `dunce::simplified`, it will see `**` as invalid path component on Windows and will not simplify the path resulting in a scope that only has `\\\\?\\C:\\path\\to\\dir\\**`\n\n<!--\nBefore submitting a PR, please read https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\n\n1.

Describe the bug\n\nCalling `exists()` with a path results in \"Uncaught (in promise) forbidden path\".
