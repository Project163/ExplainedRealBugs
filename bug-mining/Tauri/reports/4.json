They call an incorrect command from the JS side which causes an error.\r\n\r\n### **To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. In a project with the JS API enabled, use any of the above functions.\r\n2. See an error in the Javascript console:\r\n  > unknown variant `primaryMonitor`, expected `createWebview` or `manage`\r\n\r\n### **Additional context**\r\nThese three functions are standalone functions and call a top-level Tauri command, which is expected to be a variant of [the `Cmd` enum](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/70a1941468f55f0dc09ac2e13802945891d766f4/core/tauri/src/endpoints/window.rs#L88-L96). But these commands are actually [in the `WindowManagerCmd` enum](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/70a1941468f55f0dc09ac2e13802945891d766f4/core/tauri/src/endpoints/window.rs#L52-L54) and should be invoked with a window label. \r\n\r\nSo I think a fix would be to move all three of these functions into the `WebviewWindow` class and call them with the current window label as a window command. Unless the `availableMonitors()` and `primaryMonitor()` functions should be standalone commands, in which case the Rust side will need to be updated to accept these as a top-level command.\r\n\r\n### **Platform and Versions (required):**\r\n```\r\nOperating System - Windows, version 10.0.19042 X64\r\nWebview2 - 92.0.902.55\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 14.16.0\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-beta.6\r\n  @tauri-apps/api - 1.0.0-beta.5\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 6.14.11\r\n  yarn - 1.22.4\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustc - 1.53.0\r\n  cargo - 1.53.0\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n/.idea\r\n/.nuxt\r\n/assets\r\n/components\r\n/i18n\r\n/layouts\r\n/mixins\r\n/node_modules\r\n/pages\r\n/plugins\r\n/src-tauri\r\n/static\r\n/types\r\n/utils\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  tauri.rs - 1.0.0-beta.5\r\n  build-type - bundle\r\n  CSP - default-src blob: data: filesystem: ws: wss: http: https: tauri:\r\n'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self' img-src: 'self'\r\n  distDir - ../dist\r\n  devPath - http://localhost:3000\r\n  framework - Vue.js (Nuxt)\r\n  bundler - Webpack\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
