It does so by automatically [rewriting](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/1d3f51e100b0efc0e4ce164796460e9acdc458da/crates/tauri-driver/src/server.rs#L33-L55) a neutral WebDriver capability (`tauri:options.application`) to engine-specific one (e.g., `webkitgtk:browserOptions.binary`). However, this does not completely abstract away platform differences because you still need to include a file extension (`.exe`) on Windows and not on other platforms.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\ntauri-driver could automatically append a platform-specific executable file extension.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nManual edit is possible but has the following downsides:\r\n\r\n- If you forget to do this, diagnosing the problem can be hard (some test tools don't print the error, so you need `tcpdump` to check the error message)\r\n- You need to be careful not to accidentally commit the change to a version control system\r\n\r\nSome test tools (e.g., Selenium, WebdriverIO) allow you to programmatically generate WebDriver capabilities. This is not possible on others (e.g., wasm-bindgen-test-runner).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
