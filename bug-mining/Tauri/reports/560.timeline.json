https://stackoverflow.com/questions/500703/how-to-get-wix-to-update-a-previously-installed-version-of-a-program\r\n\r\nAnother interesting one from ( https://github.com/oleg-shilo/wixsharp/wiki/Deployment-scenarios#identities-and-naming )\r\n\r\n> Many of the MSI concepts are not very intuitive and over complicated. One of the the biggest MSI blunder is the deployment identities. For example, one would think that MSI identity ProductId uniquely identifies a product. And when you hear 'product' you may immediately think of Notepad++, Visual Studio 2015 or Windows 10... However in MSI domain ProductId is a unique identifier of a single msi file. Thus two msi for Notepad++ v6.7.4 and v6.7.5 have different ProductIds even if they are deploying the same product Notepad++.\r\n\r\nWhat wixsharp does is:\r\n```csharp\r\nProductId = CalculateProductId(guid.Value, Version);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere guid.Value is a static string on their project setup, but Version changes on each build.\r\n\r\nSo maybe Tauri should do the same and generate the GUID based on ProductName+Version instead of just ProductName?
