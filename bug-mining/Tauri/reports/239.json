Add a sidecar app\r\n\r\nRelevant sections of my tauri.conf.json\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"tauri\": {\r\n        \"allowlist\": {\r\n            \"shell\": {\r\n                \"sidecar\": true,\r\n                \"scope\": [\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"name\": \"bin/app\",\r\n                        \"sidecar\": true\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            },\r\n            ...\r\n        },\r\n        \"bundle\": {\r\n            \"externalBin\": [\r\n                \"bin/app\"\r\n            ],\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd of the JavaScript...\r\n```javascript\r\nconst command = Command.sidecar( 'bin/app' );\r\nconsole.log( await command.execute() );\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Use tauri dev\r\n3. See \"No such file or directory (os error 2)\" error in console when running command\r\n4. See that it works with tauri build\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nDev and build should behave the same.\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\nmacOS 12.4 (21F79), M1 chip\r\n\r\ntauri = { version = \"1.0.5\", features = [\"api-all\"] }\r\n\r\ntauri-build = { version = \"1.0.4\", features = [] }\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe example sidecar app only has one line, logging a string to the console.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4780/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
