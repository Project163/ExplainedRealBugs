I'm using Tauri v2 and have a window with an external URL. This worked fine with injecting scripts and calling to rust when I was previously on v1, but I recently switched to v2. Now, I get content security policy errors like the following when using any window.__TAURI__ API; for example:\r\n```\r\nRefused to connect to 'http://ipc.localhost/test' because it violates the document's Content Security Policy.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if I'm overlooking something. Thank you!\n\n### Reproduction\n\n- Create a new Tauri v2 project\r\n- Add the following code to `main.rs`:\r\n```rust\r\n// Prevents additional console window on Windows in release, DO NOT REMOVE!!\r\n#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem = \"windows\")]\r\n\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nfn test() {\r\n    println!(\"Called from Rust!\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    tauri::Builder::default()\r\n        .setup(|app| {\r\n            let window = tauri::WindowBuilder::new(app, \"main\", tauri::WindowUrl::External(\"https://twitter.com/TauriApps\".parse().unwrap()))\r\n                .initialization_script(r#\"\r\n                document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\r\n                    window.__TAURI__.core.invoke('test');\r\n                });\r\n                \"#)\r\n                .build()\r\n                .expect(\"failed to create window\");\r\n            window.open_devtools();\r\n            Ok(())\r\n        })\r\n        .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![test])\r\n        .run(tauri::generate_context!())\r\n        .expect(\"error while running tauri application\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- In the console, you should see `Refused to connect to 'http://ipc.localhost/test' because it violates the document's Content Security Policy.`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe Tauri APIs should ideally work regardless of the site's content security policy, but I understand that's likely not an option. This setup worked in Tauri v1, so something is different. From what I can tell, Tauri used `window.ipc.postMessage` but now uses these custom protocols on Windows and MacOS; I assume it's not as easy as overriding `ipc_custom_protocol` to false, but doing that along with overriding the check in `ipc-protocol.js` seems to work in most situations.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.19045 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 120.0.2210.91\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.73.0-nightly (ad963232d 2023-07-14)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.73.0-nightly (694a57956 2023-07-11)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (environment override by RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN)\r\n    - node: 20.8.1\r\n    - pnpm: 8.10.0\r\n    - npm: 10.1.0\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-alpha.20\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: no manifest (2.0.0-alpha.13, 2.0.0-alpha.13)\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.35.1\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.24.0\r\n    - tauri-cli [RUST]: 2.0.0-alpha.20\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api : not installed!\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-alpha.20\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - distDir: ../src\r\n    - devPath: ../src\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8476/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
