The icon will always display correctly for the Start Menu shortcut but takes a couple of days to show correctly in the install location (irrelevant as this is based on my memory not hard proof). **FYI, the icon in the taskbar was pinned from the start menu and not the app install location.**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298211/202012019-c4fc41e9-4e77-4a24-9a09-0ab8791c8c68.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298211/202012130-0ce7accd-a299-40c0-ac3b-3726f210707d.png)\r\n\r\nAfter a couple days, the icon in the install location shows properly (irrelevant):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298211/202012178-3af3d7cf-45ae-498f-9e77-4412e6eaf603.png)\r\n\r\nBut the icon of the app pinned to the taskbar remains blank:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298211/202012261-671c0636-e01a-4aca-ae12-d370333a547e.png)\r\n\r\nIf I downgrade my app, the icon shows up fine in the taskbar:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298211/202012753-6f5c1651-7624-4f9a-a309-dfe70e8fce15.png)\r\n\r\nAfter unpinning the app, and pinning it from the app source, the issue is not present\r\n\r\nI did some digging; I looked at the icon path for the Start Menu shortcut and the GUID changed after the update!\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nShortcut icon path should not change between installs which necessitates that the GUID should not change between installs which necessitates that the GUID should not be changed for each installer or version of the app built.\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Windows 10.0.19044 X64\r\n  › Webview2: 107.0.1418.42\r\n  › MSVC: \r\n      - Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n  › Node.js: 18.12.1\r\n  › npm: 8.19.2\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.11       \r\n  › rustup: 1.24.3\r\n  › rustc: 1.61.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.61.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.2.0\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.2.0\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.2.0,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.2.0,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.15.3,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.22.0,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › framework: React   \r\n  › bundler: Rollup    \r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .git        \r\n  ├─ .github     \r\n  ├─ .idea       \r\n  ├─ assets      \r\n  ├─ build       \r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ public      \r\n  ├─ src\r\n  ├─ src-tauri   \r\n  └─ utils   \r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThis is a double issue. The top level issue is that the shortcut icon pinned to the taskbar is different after installing an update. The root problem is the GUID is changing for each installer built. This is not mentioned under https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/cross-platform nor is it mentioned at the top of https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/windows nor does it show up under search \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298211/202014317-a18f862f-20f9-4629-8a97-882167407b74.png)\r\n\r\nUnder https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1405100/change-my-component-guid-in-wix/1422121,\r\n\r\n> Your updated MSI delivers a new version of MyFile.exe.
