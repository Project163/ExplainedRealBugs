My use case is, I have an app that has a canvas and a manager. I want to have devtools in the canvas window in the release build so that users can inspect the elements, but not for the manager window.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI noticed that `WebviewBuilder` in `wry` has the [`with_devtools`](https://docs.rs/wry/latest/wry/struct.WebViewBuilder.html#method.with_devtools) method. Is it possible to have the same on `WebviewWindowBuilder` in `tauri`?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10849/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
