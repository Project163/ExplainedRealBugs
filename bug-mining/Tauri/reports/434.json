I've used `\"dialog\": true` option to rely on the build-in UI for updates, so I did not build any event handling. I didn't even know that's a thing. As a result, I had no way of knowing why my updates aren't working. The built-in UI failed silently without reporting any errors anywhere.\r\n\r\nI had to modify tauri itself to sprinkle `eprintln!` all over updater's code to discover the problem.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd expect it to print errors to stderr. Possibly if launched with `--verbose` or via `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run`.\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nHaving to build a custom error-reporting UI based on JS events is more work than I expected, especially given that no-code `dialog:true` option exists.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n\r\nBTW, my problem with the update JSON was \r\n\r\n```text\r\nSerdeJson(Error(\"invalid value for `pub_date`: a character literal was not valid\", line: 0, column: 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich didn't like: `\"pub_date\": \"2022-09-15T23:54:33+0100\"`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5204/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
