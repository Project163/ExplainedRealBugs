The gist of it is:\r\n\r\n1. Have a tauri app running on a remote origin that is whitelisted\r\n2. Navigate to a custom protocol. It doesn't even need to be a real one/registered\r\n3. Notice that you get an error and you are still on your intended origin.\r\n4. Now invoke a tauri command and notice you get the IPC error. The URL in the error is the custom-protocol from above.\r\n\r\nI've attached a screenshot showing me performing this repro in the dev tools. I understand it's kind of incomplete but I think the description above should be enough to understand what's going on. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect tauri commands to continue to work when i'm on my origin and for custom procotols to not break this.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.19045 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 112.0.1722.68\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Build Tools 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.68.0 (2c8cc3432 2023-03-06)\r\n    ✔ Cargo: 1.68.0 (115f34552 2023-02-26)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.25.2 (17db695f1 2023-02-01)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (environment override by RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN)\r\n    - node: 18.15.0\r\n    - npm: 9.5.0\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 1.3.0\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 1.3.0\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.24.1\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.16.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.2.0 (outdated, latest: 1.3.0)\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.3.0\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - distDir: ../dist\r\n    - devPath: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - framework: React\r\n    - bundler: Vite\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6889/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6889/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
