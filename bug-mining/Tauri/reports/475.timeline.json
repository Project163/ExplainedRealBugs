Describe the bug\r\n\r\n`cargo tauri android init` fails when the path is linked.\r\nI am not sure what is the correct way to describe it, but basically it is a `dir` under path `A` but actually linked to path `B`, just like a symlink created by the command `ln -s B A/dir` on linux.\r\n\r\nI found a working way but the problem is still there.\r\n\r\nI have my repos in `E:\\para\\Repos`, and linked it to `C:\\Users\\para\\Repos`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ls -l C:\\Users\\para\\Repos\r\nlrwxrwxrwx    8 para     para            14 Nov 06 21:17 C:\\Users\\para\\Repos -> E:/para/Repos/\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, I cd into `C:\\Users\\para\\Repos\\tapp`, and executing `tauri android init` gives me such error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at C:\\Users\\para\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f\\tauri-cli-2.0.0-alpha.21\\src\\mobile\\mod.rs:317:6:\r\ncalled `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: AssetDirOutsideOfAppRoot { asset_dir: \"assets\", root_dir: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\para\\\\Repos\\\\tapp\\\\src-tauri\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI looked into the mentioned file, and found a function takes the linked path `C:\\Users\\para\\Repos\\tapp` correctly at start, but translates it to the original path `E:\\para\\Repos\\tapp` when actually comparing, which introduces inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThen I tried to execute `tauri android init` from `E:\\para\\Repos`, which is the original path with no symlink, but got a different error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at C:\\Users\\para\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f\\cargo-mobile2-0.8.0\\src\\util\\path.rs:136:13:\r\ninternal error: entered unreachable code: `abs_src` and `abs_dest` have no common root\r\n```\r\nLooked into the code again, I guess it is using `C:\\` as `abs_src` and `E:\\` as `abs_dest` (or vice versa, they are different anyway), results in the `no common root` error.\r\n\r\nFinally, I moved the project folder to a directory under  `C:\\`, and it works.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nAs described above.\r\n\r\nIssue 1:\r\n1. On windows, create a symlink and use it as the parent folder.\r\n2. `cd` into the symlinked path, and create a tauri 2.0 app `cargo create-tauri-app --alpha` here, run `cargo tauri android init`\r\n\r\nIssue 2:\r\n1. On windows, create a tauri 2.0 app `cargo create-tauri-app --alpha` on non-C drive (I am not very sure about this, maybe system drive? or the drive rust/cargo is installed?)\r\n2. run `cargo tauri android init`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```log\r\n        Info \"C:\\\\Users\\\\para\\\\.cargo\\\\bin\\\\cargo-tauri.exe\" relative to \"C:\\\\Users\\\\para\\\\Documents\\\\tapp\\\\src-tauri\" is \"..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\.cargo\\\\bin\\\\cargo-tauri.exe\"\r\nGenerating Android Studio project...\r\n        Info \"C:\\\\Users\\\\para\\\\Documents\\\\tapp\\\\src-tauri\" relative to \"C:\\\\Users\\\\para\\\\Documents\\\\tapp\\\\src-tauri\\\\gen/android\\\\app\" is \"..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\\"\r\nvictory: Project generated successfully!\r\n    Make cool apps! 🌻 🐕 🎉\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Full `tauri info` output\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.19045 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 120.0.2210.144\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.77.0-nightly (5518eaa94 2024-01-29)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.77.0-nightly (7bb7b5395 2024-01-20)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (environment override by RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN)\r\n    - node: 18.19.0\r\n    - npm: 10.2.3\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-alpha.21\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 2.0.0-alpha.14\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.35.2\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.24.1\r\n    - tauri-cli [RUST]: 2.0.0-alpha.21\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api : not installed!\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-alpha.21\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - distDir: ../dist\r\n    - devPath: http://localhost:3000/\r\n    - framework: React (Next.js)\r\n    - bundler: Webpack\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nthread 'main' panicked at C:\\Users\\para\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f\\tauri-cli-2.0.0-alpha.21\\src\\mobile\\mod.rs:317:6:\r\ncalled `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: AssetDirOutsideOfAppRoot { asset_dir: \"assets\", root_dir: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\para\\\\Repos\\\\tapp\\\\src-tauri\" }\r\nstack backtrace:\r\n   0:     0x7ff648ffeae2 - <unknown>\r\n   1:     0x7ff649028f4d - <unknown>\r\n   2:     0x7ff648ff7ea1 - <unknown>\r\n   3:     0x7ff648ffe90a - <unknown>\r\n   4:     0x7ff649001ac9 - <unknown>\r\n   5:     0x7ff649001785 - <unknown>\r\n   6:     0x7ff649001fe4 - <unknown>\r\n   7:     0x7ff649001eb9 - <unknown>\r\n   8:     0x7ff648fff3e9 - <unknown>\r\n   9:     0x7ff649001b86 - <unknown>\r\n  10:     0x7ff64908a3c7 - <unknown>\r\n  11:     0x7ff64908a903 - <unknown>\r\n  12:     0x7ff6480f8af1 - <unknown>\r\n  13:     0x7ff6482ab710 - <unknown>\r\n  14:     0x7ff6480f17b4 - <unknown>\r\n  15:     0x7ff6480baf90 - <unknown>\r\n  16:     0x7ff6480b7827 - <unknown>\r\n  17:     0x7ff6480bc6f6 - <unknown>\r\n  18:     0x7ff6480b703c - <unknown>\r\n  19:     0x7ff648fee8a2 - <unknown>\r\n  20:     0x7ff6480b79ec - <unknown>\r\n  21:     0x7ff64903c1b0 - <unknown>\r\n  22:     0x7fff8f5e7344 - BaseThreadInitThunk\r\n  23:     0x7fff911a26b1 - RtlUserThreadStart\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nthread 'main' panicked at C:\\Users\\para\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f\\cargo-mobile2-0.8.0\\src\\util\\path.rs:136:13:\r\ninternal error: entered unreachable code: `abs_src` and `abs_dest` have no common root\r\nstack backtrace:\r\n   0:     0x7ff648ffeae2 - <unknown>\r\n   1:     0x7ff649028f4d - <unknown>\r\n   2:     0x7ff648ff7ea1 - <unknown>\r\n   3:     0x7ff648ffe90a - <unknown>\r\n   4:     0x7ff649001ac9 - <unknown>\r\n   5:     0x7ff649001785 - <unknown>\r\n   6:     0x7ff649001fe4 - <unknown>\r\n   7:     0x7ff649001e7b - <unknown>\r\n   8:     0x7ff648fff3e9 - <unknown>\r\n   9:     0x7ff649001b86 - <unknown>\r\n  10:     0x7ff64908a3c7 - <unknown>\r\n  11:     0x7ff64876de65 - <unknown>\r\n  12:     0x7ff64832b855 - <unknown>\r\n  13:     0x7ff6482ac520 - <unknown>\r\n  14:     0x7ff6480f17b4 - <unknown>\r\n  15:     0x7ff6480baf90 - <unknown>\r\n  16:     0x7ff6480b7827 - <unknown>\r\n  17:     0x7ff6480bc6f6 - <unknown>\r\n  18:     0x7ff6480b703c - <unknown>\r\n  19:     0x7ff648fee8a2 - <unknown>\r\n  20:     0x7ff6480b79ec - <unknown>\r\n  21:     0x7ff64903c1b0 - <unknown>\r\n  22:     0x7fff8f5e7344 - BaseThreadInitThunk\r\n  23:     0x7fff911a26b1 - RtlUserThreadStart\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I should combine these together or create two separate issues.\r\nPlease let me know if I did anything wrong.
