But when i try this command:\r\n\r\n`tauri build --bundles appimage deb --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`\r\n\r\nIt fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n`error: Found argument 'deb' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context`\r\n\r\nAlso tried with:\r\n\r\n`tauri build --bundles appimage --bundles deb --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`\r\n\r\nThis time it worked, but it only generated an `appimage` bundle, the second occurrence of the `--bundles` option was apparently silently ignored.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the source code, it seems that the error originates from the Clap arguments parser.\r\n\r\nThe `bundles` member of the Clap derived struct apparently has a correct type (`Option<Vec<String>>`) but Clap does not want to parse more than one value and consider it as an error.\r\n\r\nNOTE: this problem might affect other options when using the CLI, not only this one.\r\n\r\nThanks !\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nLaunch the `tauri build` command with multiple values for the `--bundles` option.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should generate bundles based on each value provided with the `--bundles` option.\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nUsing CLI version 1.0.0-rc.10 on Linux.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
