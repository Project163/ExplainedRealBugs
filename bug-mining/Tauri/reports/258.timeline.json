Describe the bug\r\nWhen serving html files through `web_dev_server` by using `cargo tauri dev`, any `template` element contents in the served HTML are removed.\r\n\r\nWhile looking further into this issue, the culprit seem to be this:\r\nhttps://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/db7765edad14e8fb860c436a0de4fe5cd1e86992/tooling/cli/src/helpers/web_dev_server.rs#L129\r\n\r\nFMPOV, this should be changed to:\r\n```rust\r\nf = tauri_utils::html::serialize_node(&document);\r\n```\r\n(I've actually tried this change out and it solves the issue)\r\n\r\nA similar issue has already been fixed for the assets compilation process / asset csp modification, see https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5247 (and also https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4410) but the `web_dev_server` hasn't catched up with this change.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n1. `cargo create-tauri-app`\r\n2. Select plain `vanilla` HTML/CSS/JavaScript\r\n\r\n3. Add the following `template` element before the closing `body` tag in `src/index.html`:\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>[ID]</td>\r\n        <td>[Name]</td>\r\n    <tr>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n4. `cargo tauri dev`\r\n5. Inspect the DOM and observe that the `template` element is empty\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nHTML `template` element contents should be served properly.\r\n\r\nFor the example above, I would expect to see the following children when inspecting the DOM:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n    #document-fragment\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>[ID]</td>\r\n            <td>[Name]</td>\r\n        <tr>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n```\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Windows 10.0.19045 X64\r\n  › Webview2: 109.0.1518.69\r\n  › MSVC:\r\n      - Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n      - Visual Studio Community 2019\r\n  › Node.js: 19.1.0\r\n  › npm: 8.19.3\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: Not installed!\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.1\r\n  › rustc: 1.66.1\r\n  › cargo: 1.66.1\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nPackages                                       \r\nWARNING: no lock files found, defaulting to npm\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.2.3\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: Not installed!\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.2.4,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.2.1,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.15.8,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.23.4,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: default-src 'self'\r\n  › distDir: ../src\r\n  › devPath: ../src\r\npackage.json not found\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  ├─ src\r\n  └─ src-tauri\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n*No response*\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n*No response*","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1407691939","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4410#issuecomment-1407691939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4410","id":1407691939,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85T56yj","user":{"login":"AlainSchneble","id":8554970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTQ5NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8554970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble","html_url":"https://github.com/AlainSchneble","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlainSchneble/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-29T15:21:40Z","updated_at":"2023-01-29T15:21:40Z","body":"> Seems like webkit2gtk custom URI doesn't support templates :/ you'll need to use https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-localhost/\r\n\r\nNot sure if webkit2gtk was the culprit here, unless I'm missing something.
