There is a [workaround](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-localhost/commit/4126a4346b07f273b330e44bfe00af434d3f2cb2#diff-07aba1df28891af8108090f8fb0b27dd253b2601454d76e14c00e15307f0e879) if you have a static external URL you want to load, but it does not work if you need to inject in arbitrary URLs.\r\n\r\nIn our case, we have a first window where the user can manage their connection. They can then connect to a remote server which provides the UI. That UI needs to communicate with tauri to store credentials on the user machine, access notifications, etc.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nBasically I would like a setting in the `WindowBuilder` to allow injection of the `window.__TAURI__` in any website loaded in that window. I do understand that it can be security risk if people are not careful so that could be gated with a feature flag or a general configuration option that needs to be enabled (in the context for example) before the setting has any effect.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nWe are currently investigating our options:\r\n- Create a local server so the remote url can talk to it and in turn execute stuff in the rust context\r\n- Use a static wrapper page with an iframe that loads the remote URL so that the static page can relay the messages from the iframe to tauri\r\n\r\nNeither are very elegant solutions and I would prefer to be able to communicate directly with tauri.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5088/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
