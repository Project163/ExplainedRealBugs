Run this https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/next/examples/helloworld/src-tauri/src/main.rs\r\n2. But instead of running it in the main thread, run it like something like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    std::thread::spawn(|| {\r\n        tauri::Builder::default()\r\n        .run(tauri::generate_context!(\r\n          \"../../examples/helloworld/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json\"\r\n        ))\r\n        .expect(\"error while running tauri application\");\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    std::thread::park();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBe able to run it in a different thread, rather than the main one.\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nOperating System - Windows, version 10.0.19043 X64\r\nWebview2 - 96.0.1054.62\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 17.1.0\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-beta.10\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 7.5.4\r\n  yarn - 1.22.17\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustc - 1.59.0-nightly\r\n  cargo - 1.58.0-nightly\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nthread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'Initializing the event loop outside of the main thread is a significant cross-platform compatibility hazard.

I thought that maybe there could be some kind of flag / feature, so `with_user_event()` doesn't call `EventLoop::new()` but instead, it calls `EventLoop::new_any_thread()` .\r\n\r\nI can open this issue in `tao`'s repository if you prefer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tao/issues/272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tao/issues/272/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1005861440","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3172#issuecomment-1005861440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3172","id":1005861440,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts8479DpA","user":{"login":"tauri-apps[bot]","id":92124706,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBX22Ig","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/143371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/tauri-apps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauri-apps%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-05T16:09:21Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T16:09:21Z","body":"I

[tauric](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/tauric/blob/main/c-api/src/lib.rs)\r\nI have a function called `on_ready` that accept function pointer and it's being called after `run` is called and ready.\r\nI register it in [bindings/node/index.ts#L25](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/tauric/blob/main/bindings/node/index.ts#L25).\r\nIn nodejs it desn't being called.\r\nIn bun.js when register it I get error:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nbun run index.js  \r\nthread '<unnamed>' panicked at src/utils/dataprocess.rs:246:54:\r\ncalled `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { status: Unknown, reason: \"Get field \\\"needFree\\\" received Boolean(false) but params type only supported number or object \", maybe_raw: 0x0 }\r\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\r\nfatal runtime error: failed to initiate panic, error 5\r\n[1]    2267 abort      bun run index.js\r\n```\r\nYou can see that with python bindings it works:\r\n[bindings/python/main.py](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/tauric/blob/main/bindings/python/main.py)\r\n\r\n## What's your expect result\r\nThe callback that passed should being called few moments after run is called.\r\n\r\n## The reproduction repo
