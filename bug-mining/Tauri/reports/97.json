E.g. developer tooling. Or, the URIs are validated somewhere else, like a backend server.\r\n\r\n \n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Add required attributes to the allowlist in `tauri.conf.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"http\": {\r\n        \"all\": true,\r\n        \"request\": true,\r\n        \"scope\": [\"https://*\", \"http://*\"]\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Try to perform any HTTP request via the Tauri API\r\n3. Should get this error `url not allowed on the configured scope`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt would be expected that such scopes would allow all URIs to pass through the scope validation:\r\n\r\n- `http://*`\r\n- `https://*`\r\n- Or perhaps work like shell scopes and allow either `true` or `^https?://` RegEx.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nOperating System - Mac OS, version 12.0.1 X64\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 16.6.2\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-rc.4\r\n  @tauri-apps/api - 1.0.0-rc.1\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 8.3.0\r\n  pnpm - Not installed\r\n  yarn - 1.22.11\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustup - 1.24.3\r\n  rustc - 1.58.1\r\n  cargo - 1.58.0\r\n  toolchain - stable-x86_64-apple-darwin \r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n/dist\r\n/node_modules\r\n/public\r\n/src-tauri\r\n/.git\r\n/.vscode\r\n/src\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  tauri - 1.0.0-rc.2\r\n  tauri-build - 1.0.0-rc.1\r\n  tao - 0.6.2\r\n  wry - 0.13.1\r\n  build-type - bundle\r\n  CSP - default-src 'self'\r\n  distDir - ../dist\r\n  devPath - http://localhost:8080/\r\n  framework - Vue.js\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3507/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
