According to the [doc](https://docs.rs/tauri/1.2.2/tauri/window/struct.WindowBuilder.html#method.theme), it should only be the behavior is the `theme` field is `None`.\r\n\r\nThere is [a similar issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/22084) in Electron, and they managed to [fix it](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/22900) by \"propagate preferred color scheme to the renderer\".\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Set Windows color mode in Personalization to \"Dark\".\r\n2. In tauri.conf.json, set `windows[0].theme` to \"Light\".\r\n3. In Rust `main()`, call main window's `theme()` to make sure it is `tauri::Theme::Light`.\r\n4. In CSS, have different style for of both `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.\r\n5. Observe that the section in `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` is used.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf `theme()` returns `Light`, styles in `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` should be used.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Windows 10.0.22621 X64\r\n  › Webview2: 108.0.1462.44\r\n  › MSVC: \r\n      - Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n  › Node.js: 18.12.1\r\n  › npm: 8.19.2\r\n  › pnpm: 7.18.1\r\n  › yarn: Not installed!\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.1\r\n  › rustc: 1.65.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.65.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.2.2\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.2.0\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.2.2,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.2.1,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.15.6,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.23.2,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: build\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../dist\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:1420/\r\n  › framework: Svelte\r\n  › bundler: Vite\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .git\r\n  ├─ dist\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ src\r\n  └─ src-tauri\r\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
