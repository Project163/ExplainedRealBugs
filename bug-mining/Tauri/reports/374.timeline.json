my opinion, I think a call to checkUpdate should respond regardless of whether the dialog switch is present. The dialog switch only controls whether a call is automatically completed and related events are emitted during system initialization.

is:\r\n1. first check latest.json,if exists, upgrade any current version to the latest version\r\n2. if not exist latest.json, check currentVersion.json\r\n\r\nif only check currentVersion, the developer have to keep all version.json updated when there is a new
