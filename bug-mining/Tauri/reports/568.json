Like so:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8c4b4f8-b537-4066-96d8-4c0252e0a7cf)\r\n_`Show Bluetooth Devices` is the default item_\r\n\r\nThis requires the `HMENU` handle to the menu, which is currently inaccessible through the Tauri system tray API. It is, however, accessible through `hpopupmenu()` in the `tray_icon` crate.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nEither:\r\n1. Expose `hpopupmenu()` to get the `HMENU` handle as done in the `tray_icon` crate. Devs can then call `SetMenuDefaultItem` themselves.\r\n2. Be able to pass a flag via the `MenuBuilder` API to mark an item as default.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11339/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
