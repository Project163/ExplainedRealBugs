Describe the bug\r\n\r\nFollowing the commands on the RC blog post, I ran `npm run tauri migrate` after installing `@tauri-apps/cli@next`.\r\n\r\nNPM deps were upgraded to ^2.0.0-rc.0 including `@tauri-apps/plugins-*`\r\n\r\nEncountered the error:\r\n\r\n> the package `webkit2gtk-sys` links to the native library `web_kit2`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `web_kit2` as well:\r\n> package `webkit2gtk-sys v2.0.1`\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nFrom a 1.6.0 app using the following cargo deps:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\ntauri = { version = \"2.0.0-rc\", features = [] }\r\ntauri-plugin-dialog = \"2.0.0-rc.0\"\r\ntauri-plugin-shell = \"2.0.0-rc.0\"\r\ntauri-plugin-store = { branch = \"v1\", git = \"https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace\" }\r\ntauri-plugin-window-state = { branch = \"v1\", git = \"https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install @tauri-apps/cli@next\r\nnpm run tauri migrate\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nmigrate without encountering errors.
