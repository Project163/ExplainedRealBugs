Even 9b7c5d4ebd44 from Jan 11th doesn't work. I last ran a test in the VM on Jan 12th, so that should have worked.\r\n\r\nf2f8464f0  starts, prints the GIT_VERSION log, doesn't elevate, then exits. It does show the systray icon, so maybe it's already elevated? It does unpack wintun.dll, too.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nhttps://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/d999c4b8b1f9c72d988649ae22eb4a96fed05aef/rust/windows-client/docs/vm_testing.md\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nExpected the exe to run on a clean Windows system even if it's not installed by the MSI.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots / Logs**\r\nGetting this from a debug build of f2f8464f027d. Even 9b7c5d4ebd (Jan 11) shows it, too. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/assets/13400041/ffe679ec-0727-4459-8daa-2e5a81484653)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"time\":\"2024-01-30T22:54:40.2929351Z\",\"target\":\"firezone_windows_client::client::gui\",\"logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation\":{\"file\":\"windows-client\\\\src-tauri\\\\src\\\\client\\\\gui.rs\",\"line\":\"68\"},\"severity\":\"INFO\",\"message\":\"started log\"}\r\n{\"time\":\"2024-01-30T22:54:40.3483883Z\",\"target\":\"firezone_windows_client::client::gui\",\"logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation\":{\"file\":\"windows-client\\\\src-tauri\\\\src\\\\client\\\\gui.rs\",\"line\":\"69\"},\"severity\":\"INFO\",\"message\":\"GIT_VERSION = 1.0.0-pre.8-55-gf2f8464f0\"}\r\n{\"time\":\"2024-01-30T22:54:40.4640929Z\",\"target\":\"firezone_windows_client::client::deep_link\",\"logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation\":{\"file\":\"windows-client\\\\src-tauri\\\\src\\\\client\\\\deep_link.rs\",\"line\":\"136\"},\"severity\":\"DEBUG\",\"message\":\"server is bound\"}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"time\":\"2024-01-30T22:53:01.265373Z\",\"target\":\"firezone_windows_client::client::gui\",\"logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation\":{\"file\":\"windows-client\\\\src-tauri\\\\src\\\\client\\\\gui.rs\",\"line\":\"68\"},\"severity\":\"INFO\",\"message\":\"started log\"}\r\n{\"time\":\"2024-01-30T22:53:01.2658625Z\",\"target\":\"firezone_windows_client::client::gui\",\"logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation\":{\"file\":\"windows-client\\\\src-tauri\\\\src\\\\client\\\\gui.rs\",\"line\":\"69\"},\"severity\":\"INFO\",\"message\":\"GIT_VERSION = 1.0.0-pre.8-55-gf2f8464f0\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Firezone Version f2f8464f0 \r\n - OS: Windows Server 2022\r\n - Deployment method: `pnpm build`\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/firezone/firezone/issues/3451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/firezone/firezone/issues/3451/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
