Should there be a new config option or do we consider the need for audio/video support common enough to always bundle it?\r\nAlso, we most likely don't need all of these files, but we can cut down on them later since the bundler always pulls the latest git versions of the linuxdeploy plugins (I'm not focusing on doing that beforehand to not further delay v1 btw). We obviously can't remove that many of them because we don't know which of them will be needed by the app 🤷 \r\n\r\nOn the topic of the certificate thing, i think i got it _or_ at least got closer, but i was bound to windows the whole day so couldn't actually test it out. But seriously, this certificate stuff is the worst thing ever.\n\nEdit: in all honesty I don't see us providing built-in support for building appimages in later tauri releases at this point...

else.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1124388372/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FabianLars","id":30730186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMwMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30730186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars","html_url":"https://github.com/FabianLars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6594220681,"node_id":"MEE_lADOC7lts85JVuhKzwAAAAGJC9KJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/6594220681","actor":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-11T23:44:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6594220684,"node_id":"SE_lADOC7lts85JVuhKzwAAAAGJC9KM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/6594220684","actor":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-11T23:44:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1124411620","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4092#issuecomment-1124411620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4092","id":1124411620,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85DBSjk","user":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":fa
