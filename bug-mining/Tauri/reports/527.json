Describe the problem\n\n### Problems\r\n\r\nFor running android TV, i found that the Application is fully running without error but wont show up on Android TV os/Google TV os. it turns out android has some more setting to do in their `AndroidManifest.xml`\r\n\r\n\r\ni think this will nice if tauri generate it for example\r\n\r\n`npx tauri android init --with-tv`\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n### Soultions\r\n\r\nbased on [Android TV Getting Started](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/get-started/create), there some settings need to be added `Tauri does not generate this things`\r\n\r\n\r\non `AndroidManifest.xml`\r\n\r\nFirst :\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\r\n\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\r\n    ...other permission...\r\n    <!-- add below setup, after permission before application -->\r\n    <uses-feature android:name=\"android.software.leanback\"\r\n        android:required=\"false\" />\r\n\r\n    <application\r\n       ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecondly:\r\n```xml\r\n<activity\r\n    android:name=\".TvActivity\"\r\n      ...other setup...\r\n    android:exported=\"true\"\r\n    android:label=\"@string/your_label\">\r\n    <intent-filter>\r\n        <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\r\n        ...i dont set LEANBACK so i comment it...\r\n        <!-- <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LEANBACK_LAUNCHER\" /> -->\r\n    </intent-filter>\r\n</activity>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### To be notes\r\n\r\nthere is this warning, before upgrade please make sure to check tauri capability.\r\n```\r\nWARNING: We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdk = 34\r\n\r\nThis Android Gradle plugin (8.0.0) was tested up to compileSdk = 33.\r\n\r\nYou are strongly encouraged to update your project to use a newer\r\nAndroid Gradle plugin that has been tested with compileSdk = 34.\r\n\r\nIf you are already using the latest version of the Android Gradle plugin,\r\nyou may need to wait until a newer version with support for compileSdk = 34 is available.\r\n\r\nTo suppress this warning, add/update\r\n    android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=34\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n### Other consideration\r\n\r\nthou i can run my app now, I still didn't explore hardware api for TV os fully but at least `tauri command` / `invoke` working properly.\n\n### Additional context\n\n### Tested on Android TV (api 33)\r\n\r\n![ezgif-6-1dfe8a0c68](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51778c89-d712-46c6-bca8-dae978007d17)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10534/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
