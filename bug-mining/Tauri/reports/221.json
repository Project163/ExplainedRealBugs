Describe the bug\n\nWhen running `CoInitializeEx` with a different thread mode than the one used by tao (for ex : `COINIT_MULTITHREADED`), the application panics, \n\n### Reproduction\n\nJust call `CoInitializeEx` with `COINIT_MULTITHREADED` before everything as mentioned in the docs : \r\nhttps://docs.rs/tao/latest/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/tao/platform/windows/trait.WindowBuilderExtWindows.html#tymethod.with_drag_and_drop\r\n\r\nCode example : \r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n  unsafe{\r\n    match CoInitializeEx(std::ptr::null(), COINIT_MULTITHREADED){\r\n      Err(e) => {\r\n          println!(\"Couldn't CoInitializeEx: {}\", e);\r\n        }\r\n        Ok(_) => println!(\"CoInitializeEx done\"),\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n  tauri::Builder::default()\r\n    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![get_directory,get_selected_files,say_hello])\r\n    .run(tauri::generate_context!())\r\n    .expect(\"error while running tauri application\");\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nWindows 10\r\ntauri = { version = \"1.0.2\", features = [\"api-all\"] }\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n```shell\nCoInitializeEx done\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'OleInitialize failed!
