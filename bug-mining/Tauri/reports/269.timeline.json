your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nShipping a modern desktop app, it's frustrating not having the option for native window controls on a window without the window titlebar. E.g. on macOS, a window that is filled with the app's content but still has the traffic light controls intact. \r\nThis results in frameless Tauri applications having to include their own window controls, which doesn't follow the native window interaction design and can lead to poor UX. \r\nElectron has this options as explained in its docs [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/window-customization#apply-custom-title-bar-styles-macos-windows). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like a solution resembling Electron's, where you can set title bar style to `hidden` which will still show the native window controls without a titlebar.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIncluding the native window controls on a frameless window, and then having the configuration option to remove the window controls.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![Screenshot 2021-11-24 at 15 24

\r\nBTW,  how to apply this feature on Windows platform?  @JonasKruckenberg \r\n\r\n> Alright, here goes my issue-only knowledge dump 😂:\r\n> \r\n> I'm struggling a bit with implementing this in tauri+tao directly, but here is how you can implement this yourself using the `ns_window()` handle and the `cocoa` crate:\r\n> \r\n> ```rust\r\n> use cocoa::appkit::{NSWindow, NSWindowStyleMask};\r\n> use tauri::{Runtime, Window};\r\n> \r\n> pub trait WindowExt {\r\n>   #[cfg(target_os = \"macos\")]\r\n>   fn set_transparent_titlebar(&self, transparent: bool);\r\n> }\r\n> \r\n> impl<R: Runtime> WindowExt for Window<R> {\r\n>   #[cfg(target_os = \"macos\")]\r\n>   fn set_transparent_titlebar(&self, transparent: bool) {\r\n>     use cocoa::appkit::NSWindowTitleVisibility;\r\n> \r\n>     unsafe {\r\n>       let id = self.ns_window().unwrap() as cocoa::base::id;\r\n> \r\n>       let mut style_mask = id.styleMask();\r\n>       style_mask.set(\r\n>         NSWindowStyleMask::NSFullSizeContentViewWindowMask,\r\n>         transparent,\r\n>       );\r\n>       id.setStyleMask_(style_mask);\r\n> \r\n>       id.setTitleVisibility_(if transparent {\r\n>         NSWindowTitleVisibility::NSWindowTitleHidden\r\n>       } else {\r\n>         NSWindowTitleVisibility::NSWindowTitleVisible\r\n>       });\r\n>       id.setTitlebarAppearsTransparent_(if transparent {\r\n>         cocoa::base::YES\r\n>       } else {\r\n>         cocoa::base::NO\r\n>       });\r\n>     }\r\n>   }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This is how you would use the defined function in your app to make a window have a transparent titlebar.\r\n> \r\n> ```rust\r\n> fn main() {\r\n>    tauri::Builder::default()\r\n>       .setup(|app| {\r\n>          let win = app.get_window(\"main\").unwrap();\r\n>          win.set_transparent_titlebar(true);\r\n> \r\n>          Ok(())\r\n>       })\r\n>       .run(tauri::generate_context!())\r\n>       .expect(\"error while running tauri application\");\r\n> }\r\n>
