Describe the bug\r\n\r\nIn a multi-window Tauri app on Linux, only the first window ever created can receive events and have its `listen` callbacks triggered. All subsequent windows do not receive any events.\r\n\r\nIn this video, the same Tauri app runs on Windows on the left and Linux on the right.\r\n\r\nEvery window ran `listen(\"reply\", (event) => {alert(event.payload})})`.\r\nWhen the button is pressed, a Rust Tauri command is invoked, which emits the `reply` event.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, the app behaves correctly and every window receives the `reply` event.\r\n\r\nOn Linux, only the first window ever receives any events.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c0fd72-d7b8-4764-a92d-f82a2dd9af7b\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe example shown in the video: https://github.com/Ynng/tauri-listen-test\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n- Clone the tauri repo on an Ubuntu 24 machine\r\n- Run `cargo run --example multiwindow`\r\n- Try to send a message to the second/third window\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll windows should receive events that are \"emitted to all targets\".\r\n\r\n### Full `tauri

Describe the bug\n\n`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, etc. is not synced between two instances of an app, even if the window labels are the same. This is a large problem on apps that can have multiple windows open and rely on `localStorage` for data.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n- Create a new Tauri project using the latest Tauri versions\n- Make a simple button to update a key in `localStorage` and one to print the current value of the key\n- Run `npm run tauri build` and start two instances of the compiled binary (`./src-tauri/target/release/(app-binary)` in two terminal windows)\n- Click the buttons in both windows and observe how `localStorage` is not synchronized across both instances. It doesn't sync until you close and reopen an instance.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, etc. should be synchronized across all instances of an app, especially when the windows have the same label!\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\n    - OS: EndeavourOS Rolling Release x86_64 (X64) (KDE on wayland)\n    ✔ webkit2gtk-4.1: 2.50.1\n    ✔ rsvg2: 2.61.1\n    ✔ rustc: 1.90.0 (1159e78c4 2025-09-14)\n    ✔ cargo: 1.90.0 (840b83a10 2025-07-30)\n    ✔ rustup: 1.28.2 (e4f3ad6f8 2025-04-28)\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)\n    - node: 22.19.0\n    - pnpm: 10.19.0\n    - yarn: 1.22.22\n    - npm: 11.6.2\n    - bun: 1.3.1\n\n[-] Packages\n    - tauri 🦀: 2.9.1\n    - tauri-build 🦀: 2.5.1\n    - wry 🦀: 0.53.5\n    - tao 🦀: 0.34.5\n    - @tauri-apps/api  ⱼₛ: 2.9.0\n    - @tauri-apps/cli  ⱼₛ: 2.9.1\n\n[-] Plugins\n    - tauri-plugin-sql 🦀: 2.3.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-sql  ⱼₛ: 2.3.0\n    - tauri-plugin-shell 🦀: 2.3.1\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-shell  ⱼₛ: 2.3.1\n    - tauri-plugin-log 🦀: 2.7.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-log  ⱼₛ: 2.7.0\n    - tauri-plugin-clipboard-manager 🦀: 2.3.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-clipboard-manager  ⱼₛ: 2.3.0\n    - tauri-plugin-fs 🦀: 2.4.2\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-fs  ⱼₛ: 2.4.2\n    - tauri-plugin-dialog 🦀: 2.4.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-dialog  ⱼₛ: 2.4.0\n    - tauri-plugin-opener 🦀: 2.5.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-opener  ⱼₛ: 2.5.0\n\n[-] App\n    - build-type: bundle\n    - CSP: unset\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\n    - framework: React\n    - bundler: Rollup\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'd like to draw attention back to #10981.
