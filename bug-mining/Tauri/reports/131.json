Please search open issues before duplicating a new one.\r\n1. Make sure you are using the latest version of everything including:\r\n  - rustc\r\n  - ALL relevant Tauri Libs\r\n2. You must attach the results of cargo tauri info or yarn tauri info to your issue.\r\n3. Make sure it is an issue with Tauri, and not something to do with your side of the stack.\r\n4. Consider starting a discussion. Speaking of which, have you looked there? Maybe your question has been answered.\r\n5. Remember to follow our community guidelines and be friendly.\r\n6.

If the latter, please use the other template.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### **Describe the bug**\r\nClosing the `tauri dev` app window doesn't close the dev server started with `beforeDevCommand` (confirmed using the `create-react-app` template for `create-tauri-app`)\r\n\r\n### **To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create an app using `create-react-app` template\r\n2. Run `tauri dev`\r\n3. Close the app window using the `x` button or alt + f4\r\n4. Run `tauri dev` again. \r\n\r\n### **Expected behavior**\r\nThe dev server should be gracefully shut down when the app is closed.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2794/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2794/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
