That means `cargo build` doesn't get that flag, and it means my application crashes because `clap` isn't expecting the `--no-default-features` flag in my application.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be due to this code: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/4036e15f5af933bdc0d0913508b5103958afc143/tooling/cli/src/interface/rust.rs#L303\r\n\r\nAfter that line the rest of the function splits up `args` into `args` and `run_args` by looking for `--`.  Since `--no-default-features` is `push`ed onto `args` beforehand, it will incorrectly end up in `run_args`.\r\n\r\nLikely the code that pushes `--no-default-features` should either use an insert to put the flag at the beginning of `args`, or the push needs to occur _after_ `run_args` has been split off.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Mac OS 12.6.0 X64\r\n  › Node.js: 18.10.0\r\n  › npm: 8.19.2\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: Not installed!\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.1\r\n  › rustc: 1.64.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.64.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-aarch64-apple-darwin \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.1.1\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.1.0\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.1.1,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.1.1,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.14.0,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.21.1,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../dist\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:1420/\r\n  › framework: React\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ dist\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ public\r\n  ├─ src-tauri\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  └─ src\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
