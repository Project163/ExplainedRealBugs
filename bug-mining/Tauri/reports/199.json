But the development server didn't stop and continuously running on background until I manually kill the process.\r\n\r\nConfirm that it exists on official cli `create-react-app` template.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Create a testing repo with `create-tauri-app` [select `create-react-app` template]\r\n2. Run `yarn tauri dev`\r\n3. Close the window\r\n4. Repeat step 2 or check ports with `netstat -nlpn`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\n$ tauri info\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Linux Soaring X64\r\n  › Node.js: 16.15.0\r\n  › npm: 8.5.5\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.18\r\n  › rustup: 1.24.3\r\n  › rustc: 1.61.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.61.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.13\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.6\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.14,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.12,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.9.1,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.17.0,\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4262/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
