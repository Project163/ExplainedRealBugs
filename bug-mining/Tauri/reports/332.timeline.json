This works because the `is_local` variable was true at the time of window creation but is not checked again on direct so the ipc handler is not changed. This is problematic if the application has an open redirect as the attacker could talk with tauri directly.

We are completely open to this change but will prioritize the security of all users.\r\n\r\nAs you suggested to help out with contributions on this issue and to keep your application working in a similar fashion, it would be great if you could contribute a (draft) PR for this added functionality. If you have questions, comments, remarks etc. you can always ask in the contributor channels in discord.\r\n\r\nFor your use case would it be sufficient to have your 'trusted' external URLs in an `allowlist` addition in the `security` configuration and then toggle a configuration flag like `dangerousExternalCommandAccess` to enable this access for the configured sites in the scope? Obviously this requires changes in several places in the core functionality.\r\n\r\nExample of the addition:\r\n```json\r\n\"dangerousExternalCommandAccess\": {\r\n         \"scope\": [\r\n             {\r\n               \"name\": \"mytrustedcompany\",\r\n               \"url\": \"https://www.mytrustedcompany.com\",\r\n              },\r\n         ]\r\n }\r\n```\r\nThis could be used to determine if the current  host of the webview window is allowed to interact with the API.\r\n\r\nOn another note: Would you mind sharing how you currently workaround this?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1236517900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tweidinger","id":28728469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzI4NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28728469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tweidinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweidinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1236787013","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5088#issuecomment-1236787013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5088","id":1236787013,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85Jt99F","user":{"login":"FabianLars","id":30730186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMwMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30730186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars","html_url":"https://github.com/FabianLars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-05T09:54:29Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T09:54:29Z","body":">

for the reply. Currently we didn't ship the feature yet so this fix won't impact us but  it will prevent us from moving forward. I also think security is more important.\n\nWe do not know the urls at build time as they are entered by the user at runtime. So I don't think the proposal laid out will work for us. I think the idea of a flag in the configuration is good, but the whitelist need to be configurable per window at runtime and must allow a wildcard ideally. I will draft a PR for what we would need and we can discuss from there I think.\n\nNote that must injecting the core.js script wont be enough once the patch for IPC will be released.

The actual fix for this would be to disable the ipc for external sites _without an opt-in config_. But because quite a few people depend on this (even though we said again and again that it \"doesn't work\"), the scope @tweidinger prooposed is already quite generous (sounds super entitled but i don't know a better word) in the context of a v1 feature release, and i think we can't completely open it up (via wildcards) in a non-major release because this really looks like something that needs a large external audit (as it was planned all along).\r\nBtw v2 is not _that_ far in the future, we're not talking about years of waiting for the wildcard.\r\n\r\nI guess this is more of a question for @tweidinger, @lucasfernog and @chippers, but i wanted to voice my point of view anyway 🤷\r\n\r\np.s. sorry for the triple ping, didn't want to talk about you guys without giving you a chance to

The only drawback would be that the user wouldn't receive nicer custom errors but only whatever the webview would give them.\r\nAlso i don't have the everything about the ipc in my head right now, so maybeee this is not even compatible with it. Also there will be an ipc rewrite in v2 which won't rely much on the message ipc anymore so we'd have to extend that anyway 🤔

Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWe have the use case where we have an app store in our tauri app from which apps can be installed by the user. The assets of those apps are then installed to dedicated folders and the user should be able to open the installed app in a tauri window.\r\nWe specifically want to use tauri windows because they provide a secure channel for messages sent by those apps and the tauri backend because we can ensure in this way that messages sent by the \"external\" applications to tauri core cannot be intercepted/tampered with along the way (the main application is connected to a keystore protected by a password and messages from those \"external\" apps need to be signed by private keys stored in the keystore). Obviously we ensure that those windows can only call a very limited set of commands to tauri core (currently one single command).\r\n\r\nCurrently this doesn't seem to be natively possible without what seems like a workaround. Any window built with either `WindowUrl::External(\"http://localhost:[port]\")` or `WindowUrl::App([path to assets not known at build time])` does not offer IPC calls, i.e. it will raise `window.__TAURI__IPC__` is not a function.\r\n\r\nWe found a workaround with which we can still achieve the above described goal (and hope this workaround remains supported as long there is no other alternative!) but it is does seem quite unnatural. They way we solve it is that we call the window builder with `WindowUrl(\"index.html\")` and then use the `on_web_resource_request()` method to redirect requests to the corresponding folderpaths where the assets are installed, including having to guess the MIME type of the response based on the filename of the requested resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like to have the possibility to explicitly allow IPC calls by windows accessing assets unknown at build time. This could for example be implemented as a method `allow_external_IPC_calls()` of the `WindowBuilder` struct or to follow the tauri conf terminology `dangerous_allow_external_IPC_calls()`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nSee workaround described above.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5302/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
