To achieve this, I need to use the WiX Util extension, which includes the ServiceInstall element necessary for setting up Windows services.\r\n\r\nHere’s the code I am trying to use:\r\n```\r\n<DirectoryRef Id=\"INSTALLDIR\">\r\n...\r\n <Component Id=\"Path\" Guid=\"{{path_component_guid}}\" Win64=\"$(var.Win64)\">\r\n                <File Id=\"Path\" Source=\"{{app_exe_source}}\" KeyPath=\"yes\" Checksum=\"yes\"/>\r\n                 <ServiceInstall Id=\"AgentUiServiceInstaller\" Type=\"ownProcess\" Vital=\"yes\" Name=\"GetAppAgentUIService\" DisplayName=\"GetAppAgentUIService\" Description=\"GetApp's Agent UI is running here\" Start=\"demand\" Account=\"LocalSystem\" ErrorControl=\"ignore\" Interactive=\"no\">\r\n                    <util:ServiceConfig FirstFailureActionType='restart' SecondFailureActionType='restart' ThirdFailureActionType='restart' RestartServiceDelayInSeconds='60' ResetPeriodInDays='1'/>\r\n                </ServiceInstall>\r\n\r\n                <ServiceControl Id=\"AgentUiServiceControl\" Name=\"GetAppAgentUIService\" Stop=\"both\" Remove=\"uninstall\" Start=\"install\" Wait=\"yes\" />\r\n            </Component>\r\n...\r\n</DirectoryRef>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\nThe current Tauri template does not support adding the WiX Util extension in the main template, so I am attempting to use a custom fragment to include it. However, this workaround has significant limitations:\r\n\r\n### 1. Installing the Full Component via Custom Fragment:\r\nThe ```.exe``` file cannot be installed directly through the custom fragment because there is no way to reference the ```app_exe_source``` variable within the fragment. The custom fragment does not support accessing bundler variables like ```{{app_exe_source}}```, which limits its usability.\r\n\r\n### 2. Installing the Service Without the File Element:\r\nIf I attempt to install the service without specifying the file element, there is no way to link the service to the executable file. As a result, the service configuration cannot specify which file to execute when starting the service.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIdeally, there would be two potential solutions, both of which seem to be quite simple to implement::\r\n\r\n1. Enable support for the WiX Util extension directly in the main Tauri template, like you doing with the custom fragment.\r\n2. Allow custom fragments to access bundler variables like ```{{app_exe_source}}```, enabling the fragment to correctly reference the ```.exe``` file and establish a link between the service and the executable.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11520/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
