Description\r\n\r\nOn JS api, child windows created with `new Window()` are not being returned in the `getAll` of the parent window.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI have a list of all the current opened windows in my application and a button \"Create new Window\" that opens up a new one. If I click the button I want my list to be mapped with the `getAll` returned updated values (both parent and childs).\r\n\r\n## How to\r\n\r\n- Create a new window with the js API of tauri-plugin-window:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Window, getAll } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-window';\r\n\r\n// all inside an async function\r\nconst webview = new Window('window_1', {\r\n    url: '/',\r\n    resizable: true,\r\n    focus: true,\r\n    title: `Test`,\r\n  });\r\nawait webview.once('tauri://created', () => {\r\n  console.info('New window created.');\r\n  console.log(getAll()) // show parent and child windows\r\n  return webview;\r\n});\r\nawait webview.once('tauri://error', (e: any) => {\r\n  console.info(e);\r\n});\r\n\r\nconsole.log(getAll()) // show only parent window.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I log `getAll()` inside the `webview.once('tauri://created', () => {})` event, it will return me both parent and child windows. However, if I log `getAll()` anywhere outside the event, it will return only the parent window.\r\n\r\nIs there some async thing that I'm missing?\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n@tauri-apps/cli: 2.0.0-alpha.14\r\n@tauri-apps/api: 2.0.0-alpha.8\r\n@tauri-apps/plugin-clipboard-manager: 2.0.0-alpha.1\r\n@tauri-apps/plugin-window: 2.0.0-alpha.1\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8144/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8144/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
