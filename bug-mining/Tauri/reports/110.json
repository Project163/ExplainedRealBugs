Describe the problem\n\nI am writing an application, and I would like to add the `#[instrument]` macro from the [`tracing`](url) crate (as well as Sentry) to some of my `tauri::command`s.\r\n\r\nHowever in order to do that, for some of my commands which access state, I am receiving the following error, which states that `tauri::State` does not implement `Debug`\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0277]: `tauri::State<'_, state::InfraState>` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Debug`\r\n   --> src/ssh/port_forward.rs:722:1\r\n    |\r\n722 | #[instrument]\r\n    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `tauri::State<'_, state::InfraState>` cannot be formatted using `{:?}` because it doesn't implement `std::fmt::Debug`\r\n    |\r\n    = help: the trait `std::fmt::Debug` is not implemented for `tauri::State<'_, state::InfraState>`\r\n    = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::fmt::Debug` for `&tauri::State<'_, state::InfraState>`\r\nnote: required by a bound in `tracing::field::debug\r\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nImplement `Debug` for `tauri::State`\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what method works the best, I was thinking that you could utilize the `inner` method of `State`\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<T: Send + Sync + Debug + 'static> Debug for State<'_, T> {\r\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {\r\n        write!(\"tauri::State \\{ {} \\}\", self.inner().fmt())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No
