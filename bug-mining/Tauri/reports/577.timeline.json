will definitely be doing so! But before I start, I would like to ensure that my implementation is going to align with the intended behaviour.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, there are two main scenarios to consider:\r\n\r\n1. Emitter emitting an event to an AnyLabel target\r\n2. Listener listening to an AnyLabel target\r\n\r\nThere are currently four target kinds that support a label: `Window`, `Webview`, `WebviewWindow` and `AnyLabel`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFor the first scenario, I expect that an event emitted to a target of kind `AnyLabel` should invoke listeners associated with any of the specified kinds. For example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nemitTo({kind: \"AnyLabel\", label: \"main\"}, \"event\", \"payload\");\r\n\r\n// The following listeners should be invoked by this event:\r\nlisten(\"event\", () => {}, {target: {kind: \"Window\", label: \"main\"}});\r\nlisten(\"event\", () => {}, {target: {kind: \"Webview\", label: \"main\"}});\r\nlisten(\"event\", () => {}, {target: {kind: \"WebviewWindow\", label: \"main\"}});\r\nlisten(\"event\", () => {}, {target: {kind: \"AnyLabel\", label: \"main\"}});\r\nlisten(\"event\", () => {}, {target: \"main\"}); // Default is AnyLabel\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the second scenario, I believe that a listener initialized with a target of kind `AnyLabel` should be invoked when receiving an event from any of the specified kinds:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlisten(\"event\", () => {}, {target: {kind: \"AnyLabel\", label: \"main\"}});\r\n\r\n// The following events should invoke this listener:\r\nemitTo({kind: \"Window\", label: \"main\"}, \"event\", \"payload\");\r\nemitTo({kind: \"Webview\", label: \"main\"}, \"event\", \"payload\");\r\nemitTo({kind: \"WebviewWindow\", label: \"main\"}, \"event\", \"payload\");\r\nemitTo({kind: \"AnyLabel\", label: \"main\"}, \"event\", \"payload\");\r\nemitTo(\"main\", \"event\", \"payload\"); // Default is AnyLabel\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould you please confirm if my understanding is correct?
