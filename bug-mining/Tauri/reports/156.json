For example:\r\n\r\n`\"/path/to/my file.ext\" => \"path/to/my%20file.ext\"`\r\n\r\nI'm printing both from js and from the rust/tauri event loop, and the issues appears in both places. It does not appear on other platforms.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Drop a file with spaces on Ubuntu (possibly all of linux).\r\n2. Check it's path.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFile paths have their original name.\r\n\r\nTo be pedantic, I think there's a long tail of non well-formed file paths, since some platforms allow all kinds of stuff (including 0x00 null bytes). I think as long as most common special chars are working, it's ok.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Ubuntu 20.04 X64\r\n  › Node.js: 16.15.0\r\n  › npm: 8.5.5\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.10\r\n  › rustup: 1.24.3\r\n  › rustc: 1.60.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.60.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.9\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.4\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: git+https://github.com/betamos/tauri?branch=betamos-head#9ef128453b35812c6a92d880826901e3055e9ac7 (1.0.0-rc.8),\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: git+https://github.com/betamos/tauri?branch=betamos-head#9ef128453b35812c6a92d880826901e3055e9ac7 (1.0.0-rc.7),\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.8.3,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.15.1,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: default-src blob: data: filesystem: ws: wss: http: https: tauri: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' 'self' img-src: 'self'\r\n  › distDir: ../ui/public\r\n  › devPath: ../ui/public\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ bin\r\n  ├─ agent\r\n  ├─ app\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  ├─ src-svelte\r\n  ├─ scripts\r\n  ├─ ui\r\n  └─ .git\r\n```\r\n\r\nYes, tauri core is my own fork, which has a couple of unrelated changes.
