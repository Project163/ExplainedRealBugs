The `Promise` returned from `Menu.new()` never resolves. It just hangs forever.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create the sample app with `--beta`.\r\n2. In the `greet()` function of main.ts, add this line at beginning:\r\n```\r\n    const item = await MenuItem.new({\r\n        text: 'Hello',\r\n        action: () => { console.log('World') },\r\n    })\r\n    Menu.new().then(menu => { menu.append(item) })\r\n```\r\n3. Add import `import { Menu, MenuItem } from '@tauri-apps/api/menu'`.\r\n4. Add capacity \"menu:allow-new\" and \"menu:allow-append\".\r\n5. Run the app. Click the greet button. The app hangs. Nothing shows up in the console.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nUsing context menu should not hang the app. It was working before today's update.\r\n\r\n### Full `tauri info` output\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.22631 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 123.0.2420.65\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Build Tools 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.77.1 (7cf61ebde 2024-03-27)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.77.1 (e52e36006 2024-03-26)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.0 (bbb9276d2 2024-03-08)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (environment override by RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN)\r\n    - node: 20.11.1\r\n    - npm: 10.2.4\r\n    - bun: 1.1.0\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.14\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.11\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.39.0\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.27.0\r\n    - tauri-cli [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.12\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.7\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.12\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - bundler: Vite\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAnother thing seemingly happens after today's update. Whenever I launch the app in dev mode, a new directory with gibberish name is created in the same directory of the executable (`src-tauri\\out\\debug`), which houses the EBWebView subdirectory. That directory should be located at `$LOCALAPPDATA/<app_identifier>/`.","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9369/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
