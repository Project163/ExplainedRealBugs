Describe the bug\r\n\r\nAfter building the application, an error occurs: `Error failed to build bundler settings: failed to get updater configuration: plugins > updater doesn't exist`.\r\nWhen I removed `\"createUpdaterArtifacts\":  \"v1Compatible\"` from `tauri.conf.json`, the bundle was created properly.\r\nI guess `\"createUpdaterArtifacts\":  \"v1Compatible\"` config is unnecessary unless
