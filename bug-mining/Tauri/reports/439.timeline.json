am the one who noticed the app crashing.\r\n\r\nThe `download-throttled-events` branch has yet to crash the app, which is a good sign, but i imagine, that the crash possibility isnt eliminated, just postponed.\r\n\r\nThis crashing behavior happened on my Win10 installation, that was, admitably, corrupt. After changing out the ssd (for good measure) and installing Win11, the crashing still happened, though not on this project (https://github.com/i-c-b/tauri-download-test), where the possibility of a crash was 1/30 download calls, where usually it was 1/2 download calls inside a react or vue test project.\r\n\r\nIdk why the error only happend for me. My machine doesnt seem to be broken or worn out, as the pc itself is only 6-8 months old. After eliminating the ssd and or OS issue, the crashing still happened, which lead us to believe the issue is with the actual plugins code. For now, that is our best guess.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask to save and not delete the `download-throttled-events` plugins branch, since otherwise i cant run the download code at all. If the crashing is deemed to occur extremely rarely, then please add a flag that can be added, so as to lower the number of emit calls.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1794361887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JJeris","id":60788469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzg4NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60788469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris","html_url":"https://github.com/JJeris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10872117737,"node_id":"LE_lADOC7lts8517Hq2zwAAAAKIB1np","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/10872117737","actor":{"login":"FabianLars","id":30730186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMwMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30730186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars","html_url":"https://github.com/FabianLars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-06T12:23:15Z","label":{"name":"priority: 1 high","color":"E844A1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1803843738","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8177#issuecomment-1803843738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8177","id":1803843738,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85rhHia","user":{"login":"kul-sudo","id":95244851,"node_id":"U_kgDOBa1SMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95244851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo","html_url":"https://github.com/kul-sudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kul-sudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-09T13:34:38Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T13:41:08Z","body":"I'd also like to mention that there's a chance the bug occurs on the OS level: when the frequency of the events is too high, the process of the app becomes very heavy, so the OS terminates it.\nAlso, here's some evidence for that: when I run the app in development, it manages to survive the heavy task of frequent emits and not get terminated, because in development it's a bit slower than in production, so the OS doesn't think it qualifies as harmful.

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nIn our application we make use of tauris async commands (https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/command/#async-commands). \r\n\r\nThis works well most of the time, but if we push the rate in which we create these commands our application crashes. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis can easily be reproduced by:\r\n\r\n1. Check out the tauri dev branch with the tauri-v1.5.0 tag. \r\n2. Change the following in the index.html found in the commands example: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/tauri-v1.5.0/examples/commands/.\r\n\r\n```\r\n      function runCommand(commandName, args, optional) {\r\n\t  for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) { // CHANGE A\r\n              const id = optional ?

\r\n\r\n> What did the clipboard and globalShortcut do in respect that removing them make the crashing not happen?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/0rvar/tauri-sigabort-reproduction README.md I have included the output of running thread sanitizer on the reproduction. The output implies that more than one thread is poking around in Rc internals (the reference count) in some Rc inside DispatcherMainThreadContext at the same time. This is Bad News and it means that the single-threaded assumptions in the runtime are invalid.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/327c7aec302cef64ee7b84dc43e2154907adf5df/core/tauri-runtime-wry/src/lib.rs#L273-L286\r\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\r\npub struct DispatcherMainThreadContext<T: UserEvent> {\r\n  pub window_target: EventLoopWindowTarget<Message<T>>,\r\n  pub web_context: WebContextStore,\r\n  #[cfg(all(desktop, feature = \"global-shortcut\"))]\r\n  pub global_shortcut_manager: Rc<Mutex<WryShortcutManager>>,\r\n  #[cfg(feature = \"clipboard\")]\r\n  pub clipboard_manager: Arc<Mutex<Clipboard>>,\r\n  pub windows: Rc<RefCell<HashMap<WebviewId, WindowWrapper>>>,\r\n  #[cfg(all(desktop, feature = \"system-tray\"))]\r\n  system_tray_manager: SystemTrayManager,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, `pub global_shortcut_manager: Rc<Mutex<WryShortcutManager>>,` and `pub clipboard_manager: Arc<Mutex<Clipboard>>,` are both included in that struct only when their corresponding feature is active. When you change `allowlist` items, Tauri cli updates your Cargo.toml to add or remove features. So, compiling with those items turned off in allowlist causes the struct above to not have `global_shortcut_manager` and `clipboard_manager`.\r\n\r\nI am very curious whether this workaround works for others as well.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1847209451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"0rvar","id":1098408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTg0MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1098408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar","html_url":"https://github.com/0rvar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0rvar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11193816269,"node_id":"MEE_lADOC7lts8517Hq2zwAAAAKbNBTN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/11193816269","actor":{"login":"JJeris","id":60788469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzg4NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60788469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris","html_url":"https://github.com/JJeris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-08T14:01:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11193816290,"node_id":"SE_lADOC7lts8517Hq2zwAAAAKbNBTi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/11193816290","actor":{"login":"JJeris","id":60788469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzg4NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60788469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris","html_url":"https://github.com/JJeris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JJeris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-08T14:01:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
