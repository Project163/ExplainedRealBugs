I think all non-English versions of window may have that problem.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. `import { Command } from '@tauri-apps/api/shell';`\r\n2. `new Command('cmd', ['/C','echo 你好，世界']).execute();`\r\n\r\nAfter that, you will get the error.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo string parsing errors.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Windows 10.0.19044 X64\r\n  › Webview2: 103.0.1264.49\r\n  › MSVC: \r\n      - Visual Studio ���ɹ��� 2019\r\n  › Node.js: 16.15.1\r\n  › npm: 8.11.0\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: Not installed!\r\n  › rustup: 1.24.3\r\n  › rustc: 1.62.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.62.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.0 (outdated, latest: 1.0.3)\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.1 (outdated, latest: 1.0.2)\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.0.0,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.0.0,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.11.2,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.18.3,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../build\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:3000/\r\n  › framework: React\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .git\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  ├─ build\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ public\r\n  ├─ rumqtt\r\n  ├─ scripts\r\n  ├─ src\r\n  └─ src-tauri\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nIn fact, I think the error comes from [this line](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/core/tauri/src/api/process/command.rs#L395)，and I'd be happy to submit a PR in a few days to allow the user to specify the encoding (default utf-8) if you agree.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
