minimum code(repository: [mikoto2000/TauriMigrationExample](https://github.com/mikoto2000/TauriMigrationExample)).\r\n\r\nApp.tsx:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { dialog } from '@tauri-apps/api'\r\n\r\nimport './App.css';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n\r\n  async function selectChannelBaseDirectory() {\r\n    const _ = await dialog.open({\r\n      title: \"Select channel base

);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom [Migrate to Dialog Plugin - Upgrade from Tauri 1.0 | Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/start/migrate/from-tauri-1/#migrate-to-dialog-plugin),\r\n`dialog` is need migrate to `plugin-dialog`.\r\n\r\nSo, expected result is this(But I didn't change the migration tool):\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { open } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog';\r\n\r\nimport './App.css';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n\r\n  async function selectChannelBaseDirectory() {\r\n    await
