[`MacOS only`] tao should expose a `MenuBarBuilder` that is dependant on event  loop rather than window and only one instance should be allowed.\n2. [`Linux and Windows only`] `window.set_menu()` should replace or remove current menu.\n\nChanges in tauri:\n1. Remove `menu` hook on `tauri::Builder` and tauri by default will ship a default menu bar that includes default menus `File`, `Edit`, `View`, `Window` and `Help` for all platforms, on MacOS it is shown as the application menu in MacOS' menu bar and on Linux and Windows it is shown as each window's top menu. Ofc it can be overridden, see number 2 and 4.\n2. `App` and `AppHandle` should expose a method `set_app_menu()`, calling this will override the default menu or remove it if `None` is passed.\n3. `App` and `AppHandle` should expose a method `get_app_menu()` so users can extend default or current menu, if they wish.\n4. [`Linux and Windows only`] `Window` should expose a method `set_menu()` that overrides the window's menu or remove it if `None` is passed.\n5. [`Linux and Windows only`] `Window` should expose a method `get_menu()`, `hide_menu()`, and `show_menu()`\n6. [`Linux and Windows only`] Frameless/Borderless/Undecorated window will hide/remove the menu bar.\n\nExample:\n```rs\ntauri::Builder::default()\n  .setup(|app|{\n    // get default menu or current one\n    let app_menu = app.get_app_menu();\n    // extend the menu\n    app_menu.add_submenu(\"MyMenu\");\n    // set the updated app menu, or pass None to remove it\n    app.set_app_menu(Some(app_menu));\n  })\n  .on_page_load(|win, _|{\n    // get default menu or current one that is attached to the window, only linux and windows\n    let menu = win.get_menu();\n    // extend the menu\n    menu.add_submenu(\"MyMenu\");\n    // set the updated menu, or pass None to remove it, only for linux and windows \n    win.set_menu(Some(menu));\n  })\n  .run(tauri.generate_context!())\n  .expect(\"Error while running tauri application\")\n\n```","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/897211670/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":3,"eyes":2},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5145448991,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE0NTQ0ODk5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/5145448991","actor":{"login":"lemarier","id":22237916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjM3OTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22237916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier","html_url":"https://github.com/lemarier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T22:50:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5145448994,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNDU0NDg5OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/5145448994","actor":{"login":"lemarier","id":22237916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjM3OTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22237916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier","html_url":"https://github.com/lemarier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemarier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T22:50:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5145456672,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NTE0NTQ1NjY3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/5145456672","actor":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T22:52:50Z","rename":{"from":"Default

don't think the changes needed in Tao are considered over engineering since they are minimal changes and tbh are necessary.\n1. macOS should have their menus set on the event loop level not window.\n2. `window.set_menu()` and macOS `MenuBar::set_menu()` (needs to be added to tao first) should be able to remove or replace the current
