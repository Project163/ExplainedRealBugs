Looking at https://tauri.app/v1/api/config/#windowsconfig and https://tauri.app/v1/api/config/#wixconfig it does not seem it's possible. I'm specifically looking for doing that for MSI, so that the app's homepage shows up in Windows' uninstall dialog.</div>\r\n\r\nThe goal would be to make configuring the app's homepage easy and independent of the installer backend used (MSI or NSIS) without the user needing to deals with implementation-specific concepts [like WiX fragments](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/windows/#customizing-the-wix-installer-template).","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
