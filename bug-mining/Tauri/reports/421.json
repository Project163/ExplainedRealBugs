It makes use of the `build.devPath` property from your `tauri.conf.json` file.\r\n> If you have entered a command to the `build.beforeDevCommand` property, this one will be executed before the dev command.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add this (or similar) to help for `info`:\r\n> `tauri info` shows a concise list of information about the environment, Rust, Node.js and their versions as well as a few relevant project configurations.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add better copy for `completions` command: \r\n> The Tauri CLI can generate shell completions for Bash, Zsh, PowerShell and Fish.\r\n\r\nAre there any instructions after running this command on how to actually make it kick into place? If so could we include those in either the help comments or log them out so the user isn't confused on why things aren't working? @FabianLars wrote some amazing things [here](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs/blob/25b086ed5523c2e1ac6e3d1e6a86a62e654151a0/src/content/docs/2/reference/cli.mdx#L292-L424) that I think belongs in the CLI instead. \r\n\r\n- [x] Switch `tauri plugin add` to `tauri add` - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7744\r\n\r\nWe've talked about this on a few places and I've not heard anything against this, but open to discussion if needed. Basically let's simplify this stuff as much as possible. End users don't care so much about if it's a plugin, they care about the functionality.
