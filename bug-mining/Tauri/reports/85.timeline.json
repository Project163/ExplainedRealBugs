Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI was recently trying to upgrade from 1.0.0-beta.8 to 1.0.0-rc.0. However, I was running into lots of errors. I've narrowed down a reproducible error with using styled-components and typescript in a React project. I tried my best to diagnose through styled-components, but the app works in the browser, just not a local Tauri app. The app was working in its entirety with 1.0.0-beta.8, but I'm not sure in which update this breaking change happened.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Tauri app using create-react-app\r\n- `yarn create tauri-app`\r\n- Press any key to continue\r\n- Pick any app name, or leave default (tauri-app)\r\n- Pick any window title, or leave default (Tauri App)\r\n- UI Recipe: choose `create-react-app`\r\n- Add `\"@tauri-apps/api\"` npm package\r\n- Use __Typescript__ create-react-app template\r\n- Choose version `1.0.0-rc.0` for \"@tauri-apps/cli`\r\n\r\n2. Install styled-components for typescript\r\n- `yarn add styled-components @types/styled-components`\r\n\r\n3. Create a styled component in App.tsx\r\n```\r\n...\r\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\r\n\r\nconst Title = styled.h1`\r\n  color: green;\r\n`;\r\n...\r\n        <p>\r\n          Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <Title>Styled h1</Title>\r\n      </header>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Run app `yarn tauri dev`\r\n5. App is blank screen, but you can see it in a browser at `http://localhost:3000`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTauri app window is not a blank screen. Should look like the browser view if you navigate to `http://localhost:3000`\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ tauri info\r\n\r\nOperating System - Windows, version 10.0.19042

using `npm run dev` it is working just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate an empty application using Svelte template\r\n```\r\nnpx create-tauri-app\r\n```\r\nInstall pixi.js \r\n```\r\nnpm i pixi.js\r\n```\r\nDisable `preferBuiltins` in the rollup config\r\n```json\r\nresolve({\r\n    browser: true,\r\n    dedupe: [\"svelte\"],\r\n    preferBuiltins: false,\r\n}),\r\n```\r\nAdd the following code to `App.svelte`\r\n```svelte\r\n<script lang=\"ts\">\r\n    import { Application } from \"pixi.js\";\r\n    import { onMount } from \"svelte\";\r\n\r\n    onMount(() => {\r\n        const container = document.querySelector(\r\n            \"#pixi-viewport\"\r\n        ) as HTMLElement;\r\n        const application = new Application({\r\n            autoStart: true,\r\n            resizeTo: container,\r\n            backgroundColor: 0x556677,\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        container.appendChild(application.view);\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<main>\r\n    <div id=\"pixi-viewport\" />\r\n</main>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n    #pixi-viewport {\r\n        width: 80vw;\r\n        height: 50vh;\r\n

to replicate:\r\n\r\n1. `import { z } from \"zod\";` into a web app running in [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)\r\n2. Run application using `npm run tauri dev`\r\n\r\nExpected: Application runs as usual.\r\nObserved: Application fails with `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property` logged to console.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be because Tauri by default freezes `Object.prototype` for security. [This Tauri issue](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3416) describes the same issue occurring with different libraries.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround of disabling the freezing of `Object.prototype`, but ideally it would be better to leave this enabled and still have the ability to use zod with Tauri.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code that causes the issue, it seems to be [errorUtil.ts](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/blob/master/src/helpers/errorUtil.ts#L5). This ends up as something like this in js:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar errorUtil;\r\n(function (errorUtil) {\r\n    errorUtil.errToObj = (message) => typeof message === \"string\" ? { message } : message || {};\r\n    errorUtil.toString = (message) => typeof message === \"string\" ? message : message === null || message === void 0 ? void 0 : message.message;\r\n})(errorUtil = exports.errorUtil || (exports.errorUtil = {}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifically it seems to be the `errorUtil.toString = ...` assignment that causes the error - renaming the const avoids the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/colinhacks/zod/issues/3046/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/colinhacks/zod/issues/3046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
