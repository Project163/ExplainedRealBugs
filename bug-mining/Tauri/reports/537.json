(Also tried on Mac and Linux and there is no problem)\r\n\r\nI was developing an app on Mac. When I try to migrate to Windows, I got this error.  \r\n\r\nI have seen the same error message in other github issues, but I don't think it's the same problem.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\nI made a minimum reproduction project here https://github.com/HuakunShen/tauri-win-stackoverflow\r\n\r\nSome explanation in repo README as well.\r\n\r\nI simply added a few official plugins, and 2 capability files.\r\n\r\nFor me the reproduction project won't run with `npm run tauri dev`. But if I run rust code with release mode it will run.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npnpm dev # start frontend dev server\r\n\r\n# in another terminal\r\ncd src-tauri\r\ncargo run # this still gives stack overflow error\r\ncargo run --release # this will run\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I simply remove 3 unused plugins from Cargo.toml it will run.\r\n\r\nIf I remove some capabilities it will run.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should run.\r\n\r\n### Full `tauri info` output\r\n\r\n```text\r\n❯ npm run tauri info\r\n\r\n> tauri-win-stackoverflow@0.0.0 tauri\r\n> tauri info\r\n\r\n\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.22631 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 125.0.2535.67\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Community 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.77.2 (25ef9e3d8 2024-04-09)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.77.2 (e52e36006 2024-03-26)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.0 (bbb9276d2 2024-03-08)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)\r\n    - node: 20.9.0\r\n    - pnpm: 9.1.2\r\n    - yarn: 1.22.22\r\n    - npm: 10.5.2\r\n    - bun: 1.1.4\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.20\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.16\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.40.0\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.28.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.12\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.18\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - framework: React\r\n    - bundler: Vite\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n```text\r\n❯ pnpm tauri dev\r\n\r\n> tauri-win-stackoverflow@0.0.0 tauri C:\\Users\\shenh\\Desktop\\tauri-win-stackoverflow\r\n> tauri \"dev\"\r\n\r\n    Running BeforeDevCommand (`pnpm dev`)\r\n\r\n> tauri-win-stackoverflow@0.0.0 dev C:\\Users\\shenh\\Desktop\\tauri-win-stackoverflow\r\n> vite\r\n\r\n\r\n  VITE v5.2.11  ready in 130 ms\r\n\r\n  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:1420/\r\n  ➜  Network: use --host to expose\r\n    Info Watching C:\\Users\\shenh\\Desktop\\tauri-win-stackoverflow\\src-tauri for changes...\r\n   Compiling tauri-win-stackoverflow v0.0.0 (C:\\Users\\shenh\\Desktop\\tauri-win-stackoverflow\\src-tauri)\r\nerror: failed to remove file `C:\\Users\\shenh\\Desktop\\tauri-win-stackoverflow\\src-tauri\\target\\debug\\tauri-win-stackoverflow.exe`\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  Access is denied.
