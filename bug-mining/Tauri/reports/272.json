In my case, it is invoking `/usr/bin/node17` provided by package `nodejs17`.\r\n\r\nProbably the motivation for this little .c is that it respects env var `NODE_VERSION` before using `libalternatives`.\r\n\r\nAs a quick hack, this change worksaround the problem for me:\r\n```diff\r\n-if (binStem === 'node' || binStem === 'nodejs') {\r\n+if (binStem === 'node' || binStem === 'nodejs' || binStem === 'node17') {\r\n``` \n\n### Reproduction\n\n1.
