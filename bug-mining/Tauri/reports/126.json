I just upgraded to 1.0.0-rc.4 and here the event seems not being emitted.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/UserVeryUnknown/test-tauri-2win\r\n\r\nThe application consists of a main window with a button to open a second window. Once it is open there are 2 ways closing the 2nd window, either by the button on the 1st window or clicking the X on the 2nd window. Both do not trigger the event handler. But e.g. moving the windows does (so the event handler is working).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen closing the window the WindowEvent::Destroyed should be emitted.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nH:\\Source\\Rust\\test-tauri-2win>npm run tauri info\r\n\r\n> test-tauri-2win@0.0.0 tauri\r\n> tauri \"info\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating System - Windows, version 10.0.19044 X64\r\nWebview2 - 99.0.1150.36\r\nVisual Studio Build Tools:\r\n   - Visual Studio Community 2019\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 16.13.1\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-rc.6 (outdated, latest: 1.0.0-rc.7)\r\n  @tauri-apps/api - 1.0.0-rc.2\r\n\r\nGlobal packages\r\n  npm - 8.1.2\r\n  pnpm - Not installed\r\n  yarn - Not installed\r\n\r\nRust environment\r\n  rustup - 1.24.3\r\n  rustc - 1.59.0\r\n  cargo - 1.59.0\r\n  toolchain - stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n/.git\r\n/.vscode\r\n/dist\r\n/node_modules\r\n/public\r\n/src\r\n/src-tauri\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  tauri - 1.0.0-rc.4\r\n  tauri-build - 1.0.0-rc.4\r\n  tao - 0.6.4\r\n  wry - 0.13.3\r\n  build-type - bundle\r\n  CSP - unset\r\n  distDir - ../dist\r\n  devPath - http://localhost:3000/\r\n  framework - Vue.js\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3688/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
