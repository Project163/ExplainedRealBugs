I don't see any configurable option in [NsisConfig](https://beta.tauri.app/references/v2/config/#nsisconfig) either.\r\n\r\nIn our case we don't want to show the End-user license agreement (EULA) screen as it's a German software product and showing the user the agreement after he bought the product has no legal effect, see [Endbenutzer-Lizenzvertrag](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endbenutzer-Lizenzvertrag).\r\n\r\nTranslated quote:\r\n> License terms that are only made available to the buyer after purchase (for example **during installation** or as a printed insert in the packaging) are ineffective for the buyer.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nCreate a new Tauri v2-beta app and configure a NSIS bundle to be built. Execute the resulting NSIS installer and advance to second screen. License agreement screen is shown with empty license text.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf no license and/or license file is set, don't show the license agreement screen. Or give an option in NsisConfig to omit the screen explicitly.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n$ yarn tauri info\r\nyarn run v1.22.21\r\n$ tauri info\r\n\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.17763 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 121.0.2277.128\r\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Build Tools 2022\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.76.0 (07dca489a 2024-02-04)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.76.0 (c84b36747 2024-01-18)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-i686-pc-windows-msvc (default)\r\n    - node: 20.10.0\r\n    - pnpm: 8.15.2\r\n    - yarn: 1.22.21\r\n    - npm: 10.2.3\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.2\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.1\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.35.2\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.25.0\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.2\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.1\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - framework: Vue.js\r\n    - bundler: Vite\r\nDone in 10.53s.\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8944/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
