PR adds support for `files` for NSIS installer, similar setting can be found under `macOS` configuration. The rationale for adding this is the following:\r\n\r\n- Other platforms already support bundling additional platform-dependent files.\r\n- Using `files` section makes it possible to bundle external binaries _and_ their resources under individual folders. External binaries setting does not provide such flexibility.\r\n\r\n## Further thoughts\r\n\r\nMaking custom `installer.nsi` is difficult. It would be better to provide a way to have a pre and post install hooks. Maybe we could include custom `.nsh` files that would augment the behavior of `templates/installer.nsi`.\r\n\r\nThis is still work in progress and I am not able to test it. Somehow I keep stumbling upon the following error which is a dead end given that it does mention the source of this error:\r\n\r\n> Error [tauri_cli] failed to bundle project: `The system cannot find the file specified. (os error 2)`\r\n\r\nCloses
