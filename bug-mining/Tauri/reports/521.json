For this work work on macOS/iOS, I need to link against the CoreAudio framework.\r\n\r\nI'm building for iOS (using the v2 beta) and the linker tells me it's missing core audio symbols.\r\n\r\nI've tried setting `bundle > iOS > frameworks` to `[ \"CoreAudio\" ]` in `tauri.conf.json`, but I get an error that the `\"frameworks\"` property is not allowed.\r\n\r\nI've also tried setting the same on `bundle > macOS > frameworks`, but that doesn't help. Neither do I see `--framework CoreAudio` show up in the linker command.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect `bundle > iOS > framework` to be valid and insert the frameworks into the linker command\r\n\r\n### Full `tauri info` output\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Mac OS 14.5.0 X64\r\n    ✔ Xcode Command Line Tools: installed\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.78.0 (9b00956e5 2024-04-29)\r\n    ✔ cargo: 1.78.0 (54d8815d0 2024-03-26)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-apple-darwin (default)\r\n    - node: 20.12.2\r\n    - pnpm: 9.1.2\r\n    - npm: 10.5.0\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.20\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.16\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.40.0\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.28.0\r\n    - tauri-cli [RUST]: 2.0.0-beta.17\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.12\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-beta.18\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\r\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\r\n    - framework: React\r\n    - bundler: Vite\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
