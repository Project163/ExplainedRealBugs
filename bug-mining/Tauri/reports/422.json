I used vitest\r\n2) Call function from my own code that contains `convertFileSrc` and test is inside the unit test\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that this still works as it did `v1.3.0` and `v1.4.0`\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```text\r\npnpm tauri info\r\n\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    -
