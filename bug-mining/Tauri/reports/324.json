Consider the following code:\r\n```rs\r\napp.run(move |app_handle, e| {\r\n    match e {\r\n        RunEvent::WindowEvent { event, .. } => {\r\n            match event {\r\n                WindowEvent::Focused(focused) => {\r\n                    println!(\"Focused: {}\", focused);\r\n                }\r\n                _ => (),\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        _ => (),\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n2. Start the program\r\n3. Try to change the focus state of the window\r\n4. Observe\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe event should fire printing \"Focused: true\" or \"Focused: false\" to the console depending on the focused state of the window.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```text\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Windows 10.0.22621 X64\r\n  › Webview2: 110.0.1587.69\r\n  › MSVC: \r\n      - Visual Studio Community 2019\r\n  › Node.js: 18.14.0\r\n  › npm: 9.3.1\r\n  › pnpm: 7.23.0\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.19\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.2\r\n  › rustc: 1.69.0-nightly\r\n  › cargo: 1.69.0-nightly\r\n  › Rust toolchain: nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.2.3\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.2.0\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.2.4,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.2.1,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.15.8,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.23.4,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../dist\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:1420/\r\n  › framework: React\r\n  › bundler: Vite\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .git\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  ├─ dist\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ public\r\n  ├─ src\r\n  └─ src-tauri\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nAdding a handler for it via `on_window_event` works fine","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6460/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
