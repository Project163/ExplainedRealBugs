There's not an issue with the desktop application in dev mode, just the android one. I haven't tracked down where the issue was coming from, but figured I would write up the issue now in case someone has a quick idea on what the issue could be and where to look before I have a chance to finish running down this bug.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis can be easily reproduced with the sample app with a mobile dev environment already setup.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsh <(curl https://create.tauri.app/sh) --alpha --mobile --manager cargo --template sycamore test\r\ncd test\r\ncargo tauri android init\r\ntee -a Cargo.toml <<EOF\r\n[patch.crates-io]\r\ntauri = { git = \"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri.git\", branch = \"next\" }\r\nEOF\r\ncargo tauri android dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[✔] Environment\r\n    - OS: Mac OS 12.6.3 X64\r\n    ✔ Xcode Command Line Tools: installed\r\n    ✔ rustc: 1.69.0 (84c898d65 2023-04-16)\r\n    ✔ Cargo: 1.69.0 (6e9a83356 2023-04-12)\r\n    ✔ rustup: 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)\r\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-apple-darwin (environment override by RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN)\r\n    - node: 19.9.0\r\n    - pnpm: 7.27.0\r\n    - yarn: 1.22.19\r\n    - npm: 9.6.3\r\n\r\n[-] Packages\r\n    - tauri [RUST]: 2.0.0-alpha.9\r\n    - tauri-build [RUST]: no manifest (2.0.0-alpha.5, 2.0.0-alpha.5)\r\n    - wry [RUST]: 0.28.3\r\n    - tao [RUST]: 0.19.1\r\n    - @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: not installed!\r\n    - @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 2.0.0-alpha.9\r\n\r\n[-] App\r\n    - build-type: bundle\r\n    - CSP: unset\r\n    - distDir: ../dist\r\n    - devPath: http://localhost:1420/\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"amrbashir","id":48618675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjE4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48618675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir","html_url":"https://github.com/amrbashir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrbashir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
