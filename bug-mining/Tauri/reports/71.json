I see that we can supply a wix template, however I'd like to change strings, and it seems like this step must be done when running light. \r\nSee the wix doc here: https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/howtos/ui_and_localization/build_a_localized_version.html\r\n\r\nI was able to find a sample .wxl file that contains some of the strings I'd like to change: \r\n```xml\r\n<WixLocalization Culture=\"en-us\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2006/localization\">\r\n\r\n  <!-- customize the text appearing in WixUI_en-us.wxl\r\n\r\n       for example:\r\n       http://www.tramontana.co.hu/wix/loc/wixui_en-us.wxl\r\n    -->\r\n\r\n  <String Id=\"WelcomeDlgTitle\">{\\WixUI_Font_Bigger}Welcome to the Setup Wizard for&#13;&#10;[ProductName] </String>\r\n  <String Id=\"PrepareDlgTitle\">{\\WixUI_Font_Bigger}Welcome to the Setup Wizard for&#13;&#10;[ProductName]</String>\r\n  <String Id=\"MaintenanceWelcomeDlgTitle\">{\\WixUI_Font_Bigger}Welcome to the Setup Wizard for&#13;&#10;[ProductName]</String>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <String Id=\"WelcomeDlgDescription\">The Setup Wizard will install the [ProductName], the assemblies required for running applications that manipulate ZIP archive files, on your computer.&#13;&#10;The version to be installed is [ProductVersion].&#13;&#10;Click Next to continue or Cancel to exit the Setup Wizard.</String>\r\n\r\n  <String Id=\"UserExitTitle\">{\\WixUI_Font_Bigger}The Setup Wizard for DotNetZip was interrupted</String>\r\n\r\n  <String Id=\"ProgressDlgTitleInstalling\">{\\WixUI_Font_Title}You are now installing DotNetZip...</String>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <String Id=\"ExitDialogTitle\">{\\WixUI_Font_Bigger}You&#39;ve Completed the Setup Wizard for [ProductName]</String>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <String Id=\"VerifyReadyDlgInstallTitle\">{\\WixUI_Font_Title}Ready to install DotNetZip Tools 1.9</String>\r\n\r\n  <!-- The following text will be placed into the control table, using\r\n       Dialog=VerifyReadyDlg and Control=InstallText.

The main issue here is that when I go to customize the installer images as provided by tauri, the text clashes with my images. I'd like to be able to completely remove the text at the top, and it seems like editing the strings would be the best way to do this. I'd be happy to discuss alternative solutions as well. Thanks.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
