To add some info on my system so it may help figure out what's different, it's Arch Linux, x64, I'm running tauri from `cargo`(i.e. `cargo tauri dev`), and I started a bunch of small projects using Tauri to test different combinations, which means I've had a lot (And I mean A LOT) of stuff on `beforeDevCommand`, never had any problem, all of the commands closed properly when I exited the Tauri app, some of the commands I can recall were `vite` for running VueJS, `mint`, `elm`... There were so many things I don't even remember it all. I'll check React later and report here just for completeness.\r\n\r\nAnd as this points to something specific being necessary to trigger this failure in terminating the child process, I believe some `tauri info` would be nice here, or at least the OS and what the `beforeDevCommand` actually

Describe the bug\n\nIt appears that the port does not close if the tauri app is closed form the window close button rather than the command line.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Start tauri in dev mode, e.g. `yarn tauri dev`\r\n2. Close the app window with the close button rather than terminating the process in the command line. The command line process  terminates as well\r\n3. Start tauri in dev mode again, it now asks to use a different port because the original one is in use.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nPort should close when process terminates, regardless of how it terminates.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nOperating System - Ubuntu, version 21.04 X64\r\n\r\nNode.js environment\r\n  Node.js - 17.1.0\r\n  @tauri-apps/cli - 1.0.0-beta.10\r\n

Describe the bug\n\nWhen running the development command for tauri, the node react-scripts server never terminates and is orphaned.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n* `npm run tauri dev`\r\n* Exit the window or sigint\r\n* `lsof -n -i :3000 | grep LISTEN`\r\n* `node    188304 USER   20u  IPv4 2590799      0t0  TCP *:hbci (LISTEN)`\r\n* `npm run tauri dev` again\r\n```\r\n?
