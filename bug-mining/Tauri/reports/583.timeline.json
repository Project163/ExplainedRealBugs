I actually wrote that patch. Basically the issue is that `/usr` does not exist and packages are built into and later run from an immutable directory like `/nix/store/[hash]-name` with exe installed to `/nix/store/[hash]-name/bin/exe` and resources installed to `/nix/store/[hash]-name/lib/cargo_name`\r\n\r\nThe assumptions in this code snippet do not hold for that layout because it assumes either `/usr` exists, `$APPDIR` is set in the environment, or that the path ends in `/data/usr/bin`: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/d70470f868511adb551afcd17acade6dd08b14da/core/tauri-utils/src/platform.rs#L253-L275\r\n\r\nThe [patch linked above](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/728e957b03d9194b7d277907cb1bc154081cf35a/pkgs/by-name/do/dorion/tauri-env-resource-dir.patch) basically adds an escape hatch so that any downstream which conforms to a filesystem hierarchy that is not one of those 3 options can use to override the resource directory (which that need is not Nix-specific and would occur elsewhere as well, like with AppImages which already had to be hardcoded)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the code path could try to use `exe_dir.join(format!(\"../lib/{}\", package_info.package_name()))` regardless of the path ending in `/data/usr/bin` or the existence of `/usr` (either as a fallback or as an initial check), that would also work for our and I imagine most any other downstreams\r\n\r\nThank you for the prompt response!\r\n\r\n> Are you saying that rust's target/ folder is read-only in nixos?

Describe the bug\n\nRelative paths to resources in Linux should resolve to the `../lib/<name>/` directory relative to the executable location, instead of assuming the executable is always in `/usr/lib/<name>/`.\r\n\r\nThis was fixed for AppImage bundle (#1308) by [looking for `$APPDIR` env var](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/1.x/core/tauri-utils/src/platform.rs#L179), and there's a \"trick\" to make it work when running from the deb bundle directory, by [checking whether it's running from `/data/usr/bin`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/1.x/core/tauri-utils/src/platform.rs#L173). Otherwise, it is simply assumed that the application was installed in `/usr`, which is not necessarily true.\r\n\r\nThat trick of making it work from the bundle directory causes confusion, because if we try to run it from there after we build it, it appears that the application works from anywhere, but when it is actually placed somewhere else (like `/usr/local/` or `/opt`), resources are not found anymore.\r\n\r\nIt is work noting that, both for Windows and MacOS, the resource directory is resolved to a path relative to the executable. So, doing the same for Linux would be a simple change, and it could also work for the AppImage case without needing to special-case it, and of course, it would continue to work just as fine for standard bundle installations.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n* Create an application that accesses a resource file.\r\n* Build the deb bundle.\r\n* Copy the contents of the bundle data directory to somewhere else or unpack the deb file in a non-standard root.\r\n* Run the application from the new location.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe application should find the resource file.\n\n### Full `tauri info`

Description of changes\r\n\r\nWith Tauri apps getting more popular and added to nixpkgs, I believe it's time we share the tedious setup required to build them. This PR introduces a new hook in `cargo-tauri.hook` that builds on top of `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` (or more acurately, its hooks) to leverage Tauri's bundling feature in creating packages. It is compatible with the two primary targets we share with Tauri -- Linux and macOS -- and meant to be used alongside pre-existing tools for package managers such as npm, pnpm, and yarn\r\n\r\nSupersedes #318117\r\n\r\nCC @doronbehar for changes made to `yarnConfigHook`\r\n\r\n## Things done\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check what applies.
