I finally got around to updating, and this panic is fixed, but now there's a deadlock 😅 It's around the same place, right [here](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/core/tauri-runtime-wry/src/lib.rs#L2690) when it receives a WindowEvent:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    Event::WindowEvent {\r\n      event, window_id, ..\r\n    } => {\r\n      let window_id = webview_id_map.get(&window_id); // <<< hangs here\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe event it's hanging on is `Moved`, and I imagine that both the parent and my child window are getting the `Moved` event and then both try to lock the `webview_id_map`. Does this mean I'm creating the window on the wrong thread or something? Do I need to give it its own event loop?\r\n\r\nI've put in a bunch of `println`'s in my code to narrow it down and it seems like it's able to at least create the window and send + finish a couple resize events, so it's not *immediately* broken, but from a user standpoint it looks like the app hangs immediately on startup. My code that creates the window looks like\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn add_overlay(app_handle: &AppHandle) -> impl OverlayView {\r\n    let window = app_handle\r\n        .get_window(\"main\")\r\n        .expect(\"failed to get main window\");\r\n\r\n    let hwnd = window.hwnd().expect(\"failed to get HWND\");\r\n    let overlay = app_handle\r\n        .create_tao_window(move || {\r\n            let window_builder = tao::window::WindowBuilder::new()\r\n                .with_always_on_top(false)\r\n                .with_decorations(false)\r\n                .with_resizable(false)\r\n                .with_visible(false)\r\n                .with_position(tao::dpi::LogicalPosition::<u32>::new(30, 30))\r\n                .with_owner_window(hwnd) \r\n                .with_inner_size(tao::dpi::LogicalSize::<u32>::new(200, 200));\r\n\r\n            (\"WGPU Target\".to_string(), window_builder)\r\n        })\r\n        .expect(\"failed to create overlay window\");\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI put this as a reply here since there's already some context, but I can create a separate issue if that makes more sense.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1125641228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dceddia","id":505704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTcwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/505704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia","html_url":"https://github.com/dceddia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6602756651,"node_id":"MEE_lADOC7lts85HfCymzwAAAAGJjhIr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/6602756651","actor":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-13T04:18:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6602756655,"node_id":"SE_lADOC7lts85HfCymzwAAAAGJjhIv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/6602756655","actor":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-13T04:18:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6603976485,"node_id":"REE_lADOC7lts85HfCymzwAAAAGJoK8l","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/6603976485","actor":{"login":"FabianLars","id":30730186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMwMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30730186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars","html_url":"https://github.com/FabianLars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabianLars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-13T08:48:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-

Making the command `async` fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nThis is the command that hangs:\r\n```rust\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\npub fn open_activation_window(app: tauri::AppHandle) {\r\n    if let Some(window) = app.get_window(ACTIVATION_WINDOW_LABEL) {\r\n        let _ = window.set_focus();\r\n        let _ = window.center();\r\n    } else {\r\n        let window = tauri::window::WindowBuilder::new(\r\n            &app,\r\n            ACTIVATION_WINDOW_LABEL,\r\n            tauri::WindowUrl::App(\"activation.html\".into()),\r\n        )\r\n        .title(\"Activate Recut\")\r\n        .center()\r\n        .focus()\r\n        .inner_size(500.0, 300.0)\r\n        .resizable(false)\r\n        .build()\r\n        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;\r\n\r\n        // hide the menu\r\n        let _ = window.menu_handle().toggle();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis version of it works:\r\n```rust\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\npub async fn open_activation_window(app: tauri::AppHandle) -> Result<(), String> {\r\n    if let Some(window) = app.get_window(ACTIVATION_WINDOW_LABEL) {\r\n        let _ = window.set_focus();\r\n        let _ = window.center();\r\n    } else {\r\n        let window = tauri::window::WindowBuilder::new(\r\n            &app,\r\n            ACTIVATION_WINDOW_LABEL,\r\n            tauri::WindowUrl::App(\"activation.html\".into()),\r\n        )\r\n        .title(\"Activate Recut\")\r\n        .center()\r\n        .focus()\r\n        .inner_size(500.0, 300.0)\r\n        .resizable(false)\r\n        .build()\r\n        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;\r\n\r\n        // hide the menu\r\n        let _ = window.menu_handle().toggle();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\n- Create a Tauri app that includes that includes the non-async `open_activation_window` command.\r\n- Invoke that command from JS\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt should open the window. And according to Lucas, it should be able to do this on the main thread.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n```shell\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Windows 10.0.19044 X64\r\n  › Webview2: 101.0.1210.39\r\n  › MSVC:\r\n      - Visual Studio Build Tools 2019\r\n      - Visual Studio Community 2019\r\n  › Node.js: 16.9.0\r\n  › npm: 7.22.0\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.17\r\n  › rustup: 1.24.3\r\n  › rustc: 1.60.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.60.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.10\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.3\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.10,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.8,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.8.4,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.16.2,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../build\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:3000/\r\n  › framework: Svelte\r\n  › bundler: Rollup\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  ├─ build\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ public\r\n  ├─ scripts\r\n  ├─ src\r\n  └─ src-tauri\r\nDone in 5.99s.\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4121/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6610165788,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC7lts85HfCymzwAAAAGJ_yAc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/6610165788","actor":{"login":"dceddia","id":505704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTcwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/505704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia","html_url":"https://github.com/dceddia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dceddia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5989b6b20c03ca4f6c7394dc9a10966950d53cec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dceddia/tauri/commits/5989b6b20c03ca4f6c7394dc9a10966950d53cec","created_at":"2022-05-14T16:08:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8380038723,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC7lts85HfCymzwAAAAHzfT5D","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/8380038723","actor":{"login":"seungha-kim","id":767106,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NzEwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/767106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim","html_url":"https://github.com/seungha-kim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seungha-kim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9b0297038298b63adbae888d51028fd965693d71","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seungha-kim/create-tao-window-example/commits/9b0297038298b63adbae888d51028fd965693d71","created_at":"2023-01-28T16:35:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
