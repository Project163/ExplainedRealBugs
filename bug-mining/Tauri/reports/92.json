It just has it display:\r\n```rs\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: PError { kind: Verify, err: \"Wrong password for that key\" }', C:\\Users\\USER\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\\tauri-cli-1.0.0-rc.4\\src\\helpers\\updater_signature.rs:113:51\r\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Create sig \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt should tell you that there is no tauri_key_password set.
