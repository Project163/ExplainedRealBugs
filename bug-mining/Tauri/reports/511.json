Describe the bug\r\n\r\nMainly reporting this because i have no time to look into it right now.\r\n\r\n`plugin new --mobile` (partially) fails with `failed to render plugin Android template: No such file or directory` - i don't see which file it's talking about.\r\n`plugin new --ios` also fails(?) or at least complains about the Android template.\r\n`plugin new` - so no mobile - still creates most mobile code, just without the ios and android folders, i get the idea behind it but it _looks_ like it can cause issues.\r\n\r\nEdit: The iOS folder is always empty even if i just use the `--ios` flag (because of it failing on the android template i assume).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Full `tauri info` output\r\n\r\n```text\r\nI'm not inside a tauri project but i'm on latest macos with the latest tauri cli, tried both the released version and from git after Tillmann told me that there were recent changes.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI assigned Amr for now (blame Tillmann lol) but i think i can take a look next week or the week after too.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10082/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
