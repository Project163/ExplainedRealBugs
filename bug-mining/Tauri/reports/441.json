Yes, it can be worked around in javascript side but I think Tauri should take care of it since this is both undocumented and not obvious to rootcause when troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis works\r\n\r\n```\r\ndialogOpen({\r\n  title: \"Select directory\",\r\n  defaultPath: \"D:\\tmp\",\r\n  directory: true,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not\r\n```\r\ndialogOpen({\r\n  title: \"Select directory\",\r\n  defaultPath: \"D:/tmp\",\r\n  directory: true,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand will open the last used directory or current working directory\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\ndialogOpen should work with both \"\\\\\" and \"/\" on windows\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```text\r\nEnvironment\r\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.19045 X64\r\n    ✔ WebView2: 118.0.2088.46\r\n    ✘ Couldn't detect any Visual Studio or VS Build Tools instance with MSVC and SDK components.
