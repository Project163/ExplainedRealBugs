To make a desktop-only plugin this is an awkward experience as the developer would have to then remove the respective projects.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI personally prefer opt-in, so I'd see the default of `tauri plugin init` to NOT create a mobile project (or to prompt the dev if they'd like to). This could give the option to add flags such as `tauri plugin init [--with-ios|--with-andoird]` to bypass that prompt.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if running `tauri plugin init --with-ios` would still prompt the user if they'd like to init android, or if that would only init the base desktop project with iOS and skip android completely. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nOriginally brought up in https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs/pull/1412/files/be2b0c2e42ca05842674bdb5cd5cc55e1f551596#diff-2e62f026cfd52587aa884598003549fdb22855e8637da24c74c0ece364922bd8R36","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7749/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
