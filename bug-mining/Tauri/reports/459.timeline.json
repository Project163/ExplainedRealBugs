Public API changes:\r\n\r\n- [X] Remove custom protocol types and replace with `http` crate types - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7754\r\n- [x] Remove `tauri::api` module, not sure if it is needed, it still has hidden exports but ultimately it should be removed and replace with a public API if needed - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7874\r\n- [x] `path` and `plugin` modules both, have a `Result` type alias, where they should be using `tauri::Result` instead and not have Error types on their own - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7875\r\n- [x] ~~Make almost all callbacks (where it makes sense), return a `tauri::Result` because most of our APIs return `tauri::Result` and would be easier to use `?` operator.~~\r\n- [x] Remove `rand` and `uuid` crates, our usages of it could be replaced with an atomically incremented counter - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7939\r\n- [x] change `Env.args` to pull from `std::env::args_os` instead of `std::env::args` - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7876\r\n- [x] Consistent naming\r\n  - [x] Scope struct names, we have `FsScope`, then we have `ipc::Scope` - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7944\r\n  - [x] `TrayIconBuilder/TrayIcon::on_tray_event` should be renamed to `TrayIconBuilder/TrayIcon::on_tray_icon_event` - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7943\r\n  - [x] [Environment variables](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/29818de682146a75cd9a886f7b215154cad1d42d/tooling/cli/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md) used by tauri and tauri-cli is inconsistent and needs major renaming with possibly prefixing each var with `TAURI_<SCOPE>_<VAR>` - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7949\r\n  A few examples but not limited to: \r\n   \t- `TAURI_FIPS_COMPLIANT` should be `TAURI_BUNDLER_WIX_FIPS_COMPLIANT`\r\n   \t- `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` relies on `TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD` and so it should be renamed to `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`\r\n   \t- `APPLE_ID` and `APPLE_PASSWORD` should probably be prefixed with `TAURI_` unless these env vars are somewhat of a convention used by other tools, in that case, it should be fine to keep as is.\r\n  - [x] ~~`Event` and `RunEvent`, I think `RunEvent` should be renamed to `Event` and `Event` should be changed to `EmittedEvent` and a variant under `Event` (which was previously named `RunEvent`)~~\r\n   \t\r\n#### Internal changes:\r\n- [x] primitives in `@tauri-apps/api`, like `invoke`, `Channel`, `convertFileSrc` and probably all exports from [`@tauri-apps/api/tauri` module](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/29818de682146a75cd9a886f7b215154cad1d42d/tooling/api/src/tauri.ts), should be all just a shim for the globally defined equivalents in [`scripts/core.js`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/29818de682146a75cd9a886f7b215154cad1d42d/core/tauri/scripts/core.js) - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7942\r\n- [x] ~~Move from TS to JS with JSDoc for @tauri-apps/api npm package, see [discord wg-forum post](https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1146797909170466846)~~\r\n- [x] #8036\r\n\r\nThis list is open for discussion, I just made it because I keep forgetting about them and feel free to add more as you see fit.\r\n\r\ncc @tauri-apps/wg-tauri

Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWith doubling-down down on a plugin approach (Issue for context: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/6339, RFC coming soon from @lucasfernog) there are going to be more and more packages to deal with in the Tauri ecosystem. A lot (all?) of them will require the user performing the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Add to Cargo\r\n2. Add to Node (if using)\r\n3. Register the plugin in `main.rs` \r\n4. Then you can begin using the plugin via imports\r\n\r\nThis is a lot of steps just to start using something like the upcoming `camera` plugin and can cause a lot of friction to the DX of Tauri.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'd propose adding a command to the Tauri CLI: `tauri add`. The inspiration from this is the way Astro handles their integration ecosystem: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/#automatic-integration-setup\r\n\r\n`svelte-add` is another example of this: https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add\r\n\r\nThis could allow you to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npnpm tauri add camera\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would complete steps 1-3 for your by...\r\n1. Analysing the project (determine if it's only Rust, if there's a node project, if pnpm, etc.)\r\n2. Propose the changes visually with diffs in the terminal for the user to make (such as adding the dependencies, updating `main.rs`, etc.)\r\n3. Applying those changes on the user's confirmation\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThis can become quite tricky when dealing with different package versions across the Tauri ecosystem. We may need to have a conversation around what versions and compatibility between versions looks like. I may put in an RFC after this week's WG call to begin this discussion. \r\n\r\n### Future considerations\r\n\r\nWe may want to look at expanding this to handle adding frontend frameworks (Svelte, Vue, etc.) but that is a lot more complicated. I'd take this as a first step and see where we land.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6505/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/1757174847","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7696#issuecomment-1757174847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7696","id":1757174847,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts85ovFw_","user":{"login":"lorenzolewis","id":15347255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ3MjU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15347255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzolewis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzolewis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-11T08:51:57Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T08:51:57Z","body":"@amrbashir we talked about this briefly on Discord a while back, do you think this is something we'd be able to get in (and if so would you be the one able to work on it)?
