Describe the bug\n\n[appDataDir](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/javascript/api/namespacepath/#appdatadir) does not resolve filesystem paths correctly (or consistently) on iOS and Android.\n\n| OS |

[appDataDir](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/javascript/api/namespacepath/#appdatadir) API from @tauri-apps/api.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n**macOS**\n- Unsigned applications typically store application data under: `~/Library/Application Support/[App Name]`\n- Signed (sandboxed) macOS applications have directories located under the ~/Library/Containers folder. E.g. `~/Library/Containers/[Bundle Identifier]/Data/[Subfolder]`\n\n**iOS**\n- Sandbox paths are managed by the system and vary for each app. Each app gets its unique directory under /var/mobile/Containers E.g. `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/[UUID]/[Subfolder]`\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\n    - OS: Mac OS 15.2.0 arm64 (X64)\n    ✔ Xcode Command Line Tools: installed\n    ✔ rustc: 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)\n    ✔ cargo: 1.83.0 (5ffbef321 2024-10-29)\n    ✔ rustup: 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-aarch64-apple-darwin (default)\n    - node: 22.12.0\n    - pnpm: 9.15.2\n    - npm: 10.9.0\n\n[-] Packages\n    - tauri 🦀: 2.1.1\n    - tauri-build 🦀: 2.0.3\n    - wry 🦀: 0.47.2\n    - tao 🦀: 0.30.8\n    - @tauri-apps/api : 2.1.1 (outdated, latest: 2.2.0)\n    - @tauri-apps/cli : 2.1.0 (outdated, latest: 2.2.2)\n\n[-] Plugins\n    - tauri-plugin-http 🦀: 2.2.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-http : 2.2.0\n    - tauri-plugin-sql 🦀: 2.2.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-sql : 2.2.0\n    - tauri-plugin-os 🦀: 2.2.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-os : 2.0.0 (outdated, latest: 2.2.0)\n    - tauri-plugin-fs 🦀: 2.2.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-fs : 2.2.0\n    - tauri-plugin-upload 🦀: 2.2.1\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-upload : 2.2.1\n    - tauri-plugin-log 🦀: 2.2.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-log : 2.0.1 (outdated, latest: 2.2.0)\n\n[-] App\n    - build-type: bundle\n    - CSP: default-src 'self' ipc: http://ipc.localhost; img-src 'self' asset: http://asset.localhost\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:5173/\n    - framework: Vue.js\n    - bundler: Rollup\n```\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n#5263","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12276/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/12276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
