your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen creating frameless windows you're required to provide your own UI for window controls. This has multiple problems with consistency and accessibility and requires more work to get close to the UX that is already provided by the native window system.\r\n\r\nFor example on macOS there are different actions based on how you interact with the window controls (\"traffic lights\"):\r\n\r\n- Unfocused windows makes traffic lights appear gray\r\n    - Unfocused windows still respond to mouse events for the traffic lights such as hovering. \r\n- Hovering the traffic lights will display the icons, based on system preference.\r\n- Holding `Alt`/`Option` key while clicking on \"resize\" will maximize the window as opposed to the default fullscreen behavior.\r\n- Traffic lights can still be used even if the underlying application becomes unresponsive.\r\n\r\nAnd many more edge-cases that needs to be handled in order to provide native-like experience.\r\n\r\nThese cases only describes macOS-specific parts, but could easily apply to Windows and Linux as well, which would require more work to provide native-like UI.\r\n\r\nFrameless windows also has several problems as outlined in https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2549 and described in [Electron's documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/frameless-window#custombuttonsonhover)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nSupport the ability to set the titlebar style [similarly to Electron's `titleBarStyle` setting](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/window-customization#apply-custom-title-bar-styles-macos-windows) which allows for custom title bars while preserving native window controls in different ways.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI don't believe there are any alternatives and needs to be solved within Tauri.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2663/reactions","total_count":73,"+1":73,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/comments/949256154","html_url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2549#issuecomment-949256154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2549","id":949256154,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC7lts844lH_a","user":{"login":"BenJeau","id":22248828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjQ4ODI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22248828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau","html_url":"https://github.com/BenJeau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenJeau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-22T03:25:24Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T03:25:24Z","body":"Want to also pitch in a resizing mouse cursor glitch using `decoration: false` + `data-tauri-drag-region attribute`.
