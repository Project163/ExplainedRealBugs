I'd like to have an operation opposite to managing state. It is said that state storage in Tauri behaves like a hashmap, could it be possible to have something like removing entries from this hashmap? Something in the likes of `fn unmanage<T>(&self) -> bool`? So that `app.try_state::<T>()` would return None?
