Describe the bug\n\nWhile building a tauri project inside a Cargo workspace using `cargo build`, with `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` containing workspace overrides (such as `authors = { workspace = true }`), the message \"This manifest requires workspace inheritance, but `inherit_workspace` hasn't been called yet\" appears. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59457601/218345427-fe650b10-d91b-42c2-b59e-6a7656f1f838.png)\r\nAdditionally, using the command `cargo tauri dev` inside the same workspace, the message \"Error failed to load cargo settings: failed to parse Cargo.toml: invalid type: map, expected a sequence for key `package.authors` at line 8 column 16\" appears.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59457601/218345667-9142c47b-79de-41af-ac91-095098dfcdc6.png)\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Create a new Tauri application in a cargo workspace (adding `src-tauri` to the members of the workspace) with `workspace.package` keys such as `authors = { workspace = true }`.\r\n2. Add workspace overrides such as `authors = { workspace = true }` in `src-tauri/Config.toml`.\r\n3. Run `cargo build`\r\n4. Run `cargo tauri dev`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe application should have built correctly and without errors while running `cargo build` , and `cargo tauri dev` should have built and started the application.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\n\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: EndeavourOS Rolling Release X64\r\n  › Node.js: 19.6.0\r\n  › npm: 9.4.2\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: Not installed!\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.2\r\n  › rustc: 1.67.1\r\n  › cargo: 1.67.1\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.2.3\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: Not installed!\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.2.4 (no manifest),\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.2.1 (no manifest),\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.15.8 (no manifest),\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.23.4 (no manifest),\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../frontend/build\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:5173/\r\n  › framework: Svelte\r\n  › bundler: Vite\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ src\r\n  ├─ static\r\n  ├─ build\r\n  └─ .svelte-kit\r\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n```shell\n❯ cargo build\r\n   Compiling phennel v0.0.0 (/home/ianp/Projects/phennel/src-tauri)\r\nerror: failed to run custom build command for `phennel v0.0.0 (/home/ianp/Projects/phennel/src-tauri)`\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  process didn't exit successfully: `/home/ianp/Projects/phennel/target/debug/build/phennel-a82e079ebcf46626/build-script-build` (exit status: 1)\r\n  --- stdout\r\n  cargo:rerun-if-env-changed=TAURI_CONFIG\r\n  cargo:rerun-if-changed=tauri.conf.json\r\n  cargo:rerun-if-changed=Tauri.toml\r\n  cargo:rustc-cfg=desktop\r\n  This manifest requires workspace inheritance, but `inherit_workspace` hasn't been called yet\r\n\r\n❯ cargo tauri dev\r\n       Error failed to load cargo settings: failed to parse Cargo.toml: invalid type: map, expected a sequence for key `package.authors` at line 8 column 16\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe (temporary) solution for this is to replace the workspace overrides with their actual values. This makes everything build and run correctly. However, it would be really nice to be able to have the workspace overrides.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15579786912,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC7lts85QppUyzwAAAAOgoK6g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/15579786912","actor":{"login":"108518","id":12320184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzIwMTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12320184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518","html_url":"https://github.com/108518","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/108518/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cd8c074ae6592303d3f6844a4fb6d262eae913b2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/108518/tauri/commits/cd8c074ae6592303d3f6844a4fb6d262eae913b2","created_at":"2024-12-09T09:07:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
