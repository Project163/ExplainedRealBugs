So just to be safe you can run plain old `cargo build` for a single workspace, which should compile in under a second in the simplest case. Then cd to the root project to run a full build.\r\n\r\n**and a gotcha**\r\nCarefully notice in the linked Rust docs how the workspace uses `lib.rs` instead of `main.rs`. This is not just a cleaner name - it is a convention you **must** adhere to in order for your `src-tauri/src/main.rs` to be able to import from your other workspace!\r\n\r\n**note in passing**\r\nFor anyone not currently using workspaces who's doing TDD you're seriously going to want to know about this little secret; they enable lightening fast unit tests by not having to build the entire Tauri app + whatever mountains of code you may have each time you want to just run a simple unit test. Break your code into manageable workspaces and unit test them individually. Say hello to speed!\r\n\r\n**Definitely recommend using workspaces for any tauri project and maybe tauri docs should encourage
