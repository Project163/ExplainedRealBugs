Describe the bug\n\n`onFocusChanged` event stops firing for the `Window` when \"unstable\" feature is activated.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. I use Tauri + Angular template.\n2. Activate \"unstable\" feature in Cargo.toml file:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\ntauri = { version = \"2\", features = [\"unstable\"] }\n```\n3. Describe your window in tauri.conf.json file:\n```json\n\"app\": {\n    \"windows\": [\n      {\n        \"label\": \"paste-window\",\n        \"url\": \"paste-window\",\n        \"width\": 400,\n        \"height\": 400,\n        \"resizable\": false,\n        \"decorations\": false,\n        \"skipTaskbar\": true,\n        \"alwaysOnTop\": true,\n        \"visible\": false\n      }\n    ],\n    \"security\": {\n      \"csp\": null\n    }\n  },\n```\n4. At some point get window by label, subscribe to the `onFocusChanged` event and show the window:\n```typescript\nconst pasteWindow = await Window.getByLabel('paste-window');\nawait pasteWindow?.onFocusChanged(e => {\n  console.log('this does not fire');\n});\nawait pasteWindow?.show();\n```\n5. Click somewhere outside the window.\n6. Notice the event does not fire.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe event must fire as it fires when \"unstable\" feature is not activated.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\n

Describe the bug\n\nWhen you Alt + Tab to a Tauri window, or otherwise focus it without clicking on its contents, you are unable to interact with its contents without first clicking inside of it.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Add `unstable` feature to `examples/api` app:\n\n   https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/b0ddee8992ac3c7d47e2cfc9714f5725fadca7cf/examples/api/src-tauri/Cargo.toml#L29-L36\n\n2. Build and start the example app.\n3. Press Alt + Tab to un-focus it.\n4. Press Alt + Tab to focus it again\n5. Press Tab\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nPressing Tab moves focus to the next HTML element.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n[✔] Environment\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.19045 x86_64 (X64)\n    ✔ WebView2: 136.0.3240.76\n    ✔ MSVC: Visual Studio Community 2022\n    ✔ rustc: 1.85.1 (4eb161250 2025-03-15)\n    ✔ cargo: 1.85.1 (d73d2caf9 2024-12-31)\n    ✔ rustup: 1.28.1 (f9edccde0 2025-03-05)\n    ✔ Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)\n    - node: 20.19.0\n    - pnpm: 10.10.0\n    - npm: 10.8.2\n\n[-] Packages\n    - tauri 🦀: 2.5.1\n    - tauri-build 🦀: 2.2.0\n    - wry 🦀: 0.51.2\n    - tao 🦀: 0.33.0\n    - @tauri-apps/api : not installed!\n    - @tauri-apps/cli : 2.5.0\n\n[-] Plugins\n    - tauri-plugin-log 🦀: 2.4.0\n    - @tauri-apps/plugin-log : not installed!\n\n[-] App\n    - build-type: bundle\n    - CSP: font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com; style-src 'unsafe-inline' 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com; connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost; img-src 'self' asset: http://asset.localhost blob: data:; default-src 'self' customprotocol: asset:\n    - frontendDist: ../dist\n    - devUrl: http://localhost:1420/\n    - framework: Svelte\n    - bundler: Vite\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe bug does not appear _without_ `unstable`.
