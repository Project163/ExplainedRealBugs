This seems to be the case regardless of the types associated with the `HashMap`. I have verified that the `HashMap` is correctly `Serialized`. I am using Yew as a front end.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nMRE is located at https://github.com/bicarlsen/tauri-command-hashmap-mre.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`HashMap` should arrive as was sent.\n\n### Platform and versions\n\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Pop!_OS 22.04 X64\r\n  › Node.js: 19.4.0\r\n  › npm: 9.2.0\r\n  › pnpm: Not installed!\r\n  › yarn: Not installed!\r\n  › rustup: 1.25.1\r\n  › rustc: 1.66.0\r\n  › cargo: 1.66.0\r\n  › Rust toolchain: stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\n\r\nPackages\r\nWARNING: no lock files found, defaulting to npm\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.2.2\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: Not installed!\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.2.3,\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: 1.2.1,\r\n  › tao [RUST]: 0.15.8,\r\n  › wry [RUST]: 0.23.4,\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../dist\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:1420/\r\npackage.json not found\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  ├─ src-tauri\r\n  ├─ .git\r\n  ├─ target\r\n  ├─ dist\r\n  ├─ public\r\n  └─ src\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6078/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
