Describe the bug\n\nMy login interface calls a WordPress plugin called miniorange, which generates an oauth2 token. After several 302 redirects, the login interface writes the token generated by oauth2 to the local computer through set-cookie, which makes it easier for other WordPress pages to retrieve the token from the cookie.\nAfter I packaged the project into a tauri app, I applied for all network requests through tauri-plugin-http, but the set-cookie of the login interface failed. The reason seems to be that tauri does not allow local reading and writing of cookies. So I want to control the number of redirects through the maxRedirections parameter to obtain the set-cookie in the response header, but tauri-plugin-http does not call back the response body or response header to me, but only calls back an error: \n`error following redirect for url (https://myhost.com/?code=Svq6CXQV1pN8Cs0zz_5gHOZplnzcgdru41MP-JZ30VBbQSZ4mvPWKQ08pvYOqYMJOPAB9iIJnCN9BqpPI2LrEmTBSAw4c0XvGJzt7YtqcvP4-BDI02hYckxdp-ilylfC)`\nI found out that someone has asked a similar question before, but it seems that this question has not been solved yet.\nhttps://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4795#issue-1322538821\n\n### Reproduction\n\nHere is my code:\n```\nimport { fetch } from \"@tauri-apps/plugin-http\"\n\n\n\nexport default async function Request(config) {\n  config.headers = config.headers || {}\n  if (!config.headers[\"Content-Type\"]) {\n    config.headers[\"Content-Type\"] = \"application/json;charset=utf-8\"\n  }\n  if (!config.headers[\"x-locale\"]) {\n    config.headers[\"x-locale\"] = Cookies.get(\"locale\") || \"en-US\"\n  }\n\n  const isToken = (config.headers || {}).isToken === false\n  const isRepeatSubmit = (config.headers || {}).repeatSubmit === false\n  if (getToken() && !isToken) {\n    config.headers[\"X-Authorization\"] = getToken() \n  }\n\n  if (config.method === \"get\" && config.params) {\n    let url = config.url + \"?\" + tansParams(config.params)\n    url = url.slice(0, -1)\n    config.params = {}\n    config.url = url\n  }\n  if (\n    !isRepeatSubmit &&\n    (config.method === \"post\" || config.method === \"put\")\n  ) {\n    const requestObj = {\n      url: config.url,\n      data:\n        typeof config.data === \"object\"\n          ?
