This idea is in a very early stage, please contribute by leaving questions and ideas!\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe backend currently has two different ways of exposing ApIs to the frontend: Commands (and Plugins) as well as the core APIs. Commands are very modular while the core APIs are not.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nModularizing the core api using a similar system to #2959, inspired by [deno's extensions](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/runtime/worker.rs#L95-L148).\r\nSo a tauri app could look like this:\r\n```rust\r\nlet plugins = vec![\r\n   tauri::api::fs::init(),\r\n   tauri::api::path::init()\r\n];\r\n\r\ntauri::Builder::default()\r\n   .plugins(plugins)\r\n   .build(tauri::generate_context!())\r\n   .expect(\"error while building tauri application\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why?**:\r\n1. **In-code configuration.** \r\n   When reading the code it's immediately obvious what APIs are available to the frontend.\r\n   The current allowlist system split's feature configuration between the app, the `Cargo.toml` file and the `tauri.conf.json` file.\r\n   There is also no opportunity to add comments in the `tauri.conf.json` file, where dev could explain *why* an API is enabled.\r\n2. **No feature flags.** \r\n   Tauri apps would be as slim as possible without the copious amounts of feature flags we employ right now. (Of course more involved features like systray would still use them on top)\r\n   This makes the cli waay simpler and less error prone. \r\n3. **Capabilities.** \r\n   The `init` function is a very natural way to pass capabilities to APIs enabling capability oriented design. \r\n4. **A clear path for new APIs.**\r\n   @amrbashir pioneered this with the vibrancy plugin. Similar to rust itself, we could develop new APIs in separately versioned plugins, that can be iterated upon more easily. Once they reached sufficient stability can be merged into the core. This is maybe the most compelling reason IMO.\r\n5. **A clear path for old APIs.**\r\n   Core APIs can be deprecated and still be accessible to users who didn't upgrade yet, while not taking up space for users who did.  (I could see `withGlobalTauri` going this route for example. It would still be there for users who need it, but would never end up in the binary for users who don't)\r\n\r\n**Open Questions**\r\n- Would the name *plugin* still be applicable to this new system?\r\n- How do users tell the `tauri::Builder` about plugins?\r\n- Does `tauri::Builder::default()` come with *default plugins*?\r\n- Are there core plugins that will **not** be modular (i.e. enabled by

Describe the problem\r\nI noticed a recurring theme among discord questions: Issues with commands.\r\n\r\nHere is a short list of the most common ones:\r\n- Async cmds must return Result (throws a lifetime error otherwise) see #2533.\r\n- What parameters are available to commands?\r\n- `__cmd__<command name> is not defined` / `__cmd__my_<command name> must be defined only once`\r\n- macros are arcane magic, especially for rust beginners\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWhile most of this can be addressed through docs, I wanna propose a in-code solution:\r\n\r\n> rust pseudocode\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Ctx {\r\n   app: AppHandle,\r\n   window: Window\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype CmdFn = dyn Fn(InvokeMessage);\r\n\r\nfn cmd_sync<F,A,R>(cmd_fn: F) -> Box<CmdFn>\r\nwhere \r\n   F: Fn(Ctx, A) -> Result<R, Error> + 'static\r\n   A: DeserializeOwned\r\n   R: Serialize + 'static\r\n\r\nfn cmd_async<F,A,R,RV>(cmd_fn: F) -> Box<CmdFn>\r\nwhere\r\n   F: Fn(Ctx, A) -> R + 'static,\r\n   A: DeserializeOwned,\r\n   R: Future<Output = Result<RV, Error>>,\r\n   RV: Serialize + 'static\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage example (using the plugin builder proposal #2959 ):\r\n```rs\r\nasync fn foo(ctx: Ctx, arg: String) -> Result<(), Error> {\r\n   println!(\"{}\", arg);\r\n   Ok(())\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn init() -> Plugin { // not the Plugin trait\r\n   PluginBuilder::new(\"example\")\r\n      .commands([\r\n         // This is where the above function comes into play\r\n         cmd_async(foo)\r\n      ])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has several advantages over the current situation:\r\n1. It enforces users to return `Result`, clearly mapping to frontend promise states.\r\n2. Doesn't produce weird lifetime, or variable errors\r\n3. Handlers are heap allocated, this paves the way for one time commands. (A variation of the above allowing `FnOnce` as arguments)\r\n4. It's easier to both export functions (for rust users) and making them available through IPC.\r\n\r\n### Incremental Adoption\r\nThe command macro can trivially use this new system under the hood, so we don't break existing code. \r\nWe could then mark it as deprecated and remove it with v3.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis heavily inspired by denos op functions: https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/core/ops_json.rs\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n#3255\r\n#2533\r\n#3029\n\n### Features/Use cases to consider\n\n- One time commands\n- Abortable commands\n- Proper namespacing (`<module>.<command>`)\n- Commands callable from Rust\n- Command Scoping (allowing only certain contexts to access certain commands)\n- IPC middleware","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3256/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6020918115,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC7lts84_Y3QUzwAAAAFm3-tj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/6020918115","actor":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9aed299621763a6e0a35d102cdf012da522dac35","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/commits/9aed299621763a6e0a35d102cdf012da522dac35","created_at":"2022-02-07T17:06:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6921355799,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOC7lts84_Y3QUzwAAAAGci4IX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/events/6921355799","actor":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-01T22:51:12Z","label":{"name":"status: needs discussion","color":"059372"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
