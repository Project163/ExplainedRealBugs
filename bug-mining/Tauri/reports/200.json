Then, running `tauri info` shows \"(no lockfile)\", or older versions of my dependencies if I already have a lockfile in `./src-tauri/`.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a new tauri project\r\n2. Add a `Cargo.toml` file at the root directory with \r\n```\r\n[workspace]\r\nmembers = [\r\n  \"src-tauri\",\r\n]\r\n```\r\n3. Run `tauri info` and you will see `(no lockfile)` for tauri deps.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect it to default first to use the cargo lock file at the top level (same as cargo).\r\n\r\n### Platform and versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n`$ npm run tauri info`\r\n\r\n\r\n> tauri-test-app@0.1.0 tauri\r\n> tauri \"info\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\n  › OS: Mac OS 12.3.1 X64\r\n  › Node.js: 18.2.0\r\n  › npm: 8.9.0\r\n  › pnpm: 6.11.0\r\n  › yarn: 1.22.15\r\n  › rustup: 1.24.3\r\n  › rustc: 1.62.0-beta.2\r\n  › cargo: 1.62.0-beta.2\r\n  › Rust toolchain: beta-aarch64-apple-darwin \r\n\r\nPackages\r\n  › @tauri-apps/cli [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.13\r\n  › @tauri-apps/api [NPM]: 1.0.0-rc.6\r\n  › tauri [RUST]: 1.0.0-rc.14 (no lockfile),\r\n  › tauri-build [RUST]: no manifest (no lockfile),\r\n  › tao [RUST]: no manifest (no lockfile),\r\n  › wry [RUST]: no manifest (no lockfile),\r\n\r\nApp\r\n  › build-type: bundle\r\n  › CSP: unset\r\n  › distDir: ../dist\r\n  › devPath: http://localhost:3000/\r\n  › framework: Vue.js\r\n\r\nApp directory structure\r\n  ├─ core\r\n  ├─ test\r\n  ├─ dist\r\n  ├─ target\r\n  ├─ node_modules\r\n  ├─ public\r\n  ├─ src-tauri\r\n  ├─ .git\r\n  ├─ .vscode\r\n  └─ src\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI'm pretty new to Tauri and Rust, so if this is not the \"correct\" way of structuring my project I can close this, but it was very confusing to me initially that I was seeing outdated versions of tauri in my tauri info when using cargo workspaces.\r\n\r\nI could place the library directory (`core/`) as a sub-directory in `./src-tauri` and move my workspace into that directory as well, but that seems counter to what I'm trying to build, where tauri is an optional front-end to this library, and the main component of my repo is in `core`.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4232/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
