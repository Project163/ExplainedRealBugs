Describe the problem\n\nCurrently all Tauri core APIs are pseudo plugins.\r\n\r\nThey implement the plugin trait but are not individual crates following the `tauri-plugin-` naming scheme, as this would cause circular dependencies for the code depending on tauri and the tauri code depending on the \"plugin\".\r\n\r\nThis means currently we:\r\n\r\n* Need to reserve/block all tauri-plugin-<core plugin name> plugins\r\n\r\n* Can not differentiate between core and external plugins\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nTo mitigate some problems we propose a `core-` prefix for all core plugins and to document and enforce that the `core-` plugin \"namespace\"  is only able to be used from within the tauri core and not from any other plugin.\r\n\r\n- [ ] All `tauri-plugin-core-*` crates should be blocked from being initialized outside of the Tauri core.\r\n- [ ] No `tauri-plugin-core` crate should be valid. Maybe we reserve the crate name to avoid confusion?\r\n- [ ] The core plugins should be renamed as `core-<core-plugin-name>` (e.g. `core-path`, `core-window`, `core-webview`, ...).\r\n\r\nThe documentation should be updated to reflect this behavior.\r\n\r\nAs this is a breaking change we need to test this explicitly and involve multiple people for a review.\r\nThis will add minimal boilerplate in the code and permission files but should be mostly mitigated by having a `core:default` permission set for all core plugins.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nWe considered changing the architecture to be able to handle more than one namespace like `core:app:reload` instead of `app:reload` but this is also a breaking change involving a bigger refactor and we still have the `core` prefix/namespace to be reserved.\n\n### Additional context\n\nWas initially discussed with @chippers and @lucasfernog ","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
