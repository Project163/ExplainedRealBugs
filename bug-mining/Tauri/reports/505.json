Right now, I understand that in `tauri.conf.json` I can define `package` -> `productName`.  This is what is used to name installers, exe's, log files (if using the [plugin](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/v1/plugins/log)), etc.  \r\n\r\nBut it also is what is used for the \"user-facing\" display name, for example what it is called in the Start Menu on Windows.  So for `my-app`, if I want the user to have a \"user-friendly\" name to search for, I need to set `productName` to `My App`.  But then the underlying executable is called `My App.exe`, which just kind of irks me lol.  I think it should be `my-app.exe`.  It just seems more professional, and more in line with what I see in other apps I have installed on my system.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nKeep `productName` as the default way of naming your app.  But add an option in `package` called `displayName`, which determines the \"user-facing\" name of the application, while keeping file-system friendly `productName` for .exe's, etc.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI am thinking that this would be an app manifest thing on Windows.  Not sure about Linux and Mac.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lucasfernog","id":20051258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasfernog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8109/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
