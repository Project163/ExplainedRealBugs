I plan to add that but as far as I know, we support signing with OV certificates only (more specifically, those issued before prior to 2023) so if you have an EV certificate, you must have a different signing workflow and in that case you will need to directly use, `uninstfinalize!`.\r\n\r\ncc @FabianLars since he knows more about Windows

cc FabianLars since he knows more about Windows signing\r\n\r\nI can only confirm what you said 👍 We currently don't support signing with hardware tokens (including cloud HSM) so manual steps are required either way. And imo it doesn't make sense to add support for it just for the nsis uninstaller if the rest of the build pipeline doesn't support it (It's also not straight forward to add it since the cli differs if you use a local token vs a cloud one, especially since we have access to neither...)\r\n\r\nThat said, we should look into supporting old OV certificates at least to match the rest of tauri's
