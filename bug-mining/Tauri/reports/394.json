Describe the bug\n\nrunning an executable that depends on other shared libraries won't work unless you place all the files/folders and the binary itself directly in the src-tauri folder and copy them

otherwise the `src-tauri` directory becomes a huge mess\n\n### Platform and versions\n\nx86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\ntested in 1.2 and 2-alpha.0 both fail\n\n### Stack trace\n\n_No response_\n\n###
