📋 Explain your issue\n\nTauri is an interesting framework, as it seemingly connects two different programming languages (JavaScript and Rust). The issue is that this is very uncommon, and a lot of external tools and frameworks don't have dedicated guides or instructions on how to set them up with Tauri. Some of those are app stores, which are a great tool to spread awareness of your app, find new users and maybe potential contributors. \r\n\r\nI am currently developing an antivirus using Tauri and Next.js. It currently has a decent amount of users and after just a couple of days, someone suggested publishing the app to Flathub and soon others followed with suggesting other app stores like Snapcraft or AppImageHub and Chocolatey. I did some research and tried to set them up, here are my results so far:\r\n\r\n- Chocolatey: Uploaded executable using [this guide](https://dev.to/tgotwig/publish-a-simple-executable-from-rust-on-chocolatey-2pbl). Executable got flagged as malware and still awaiting moderators approval\r\n- Flathub: Unclear requirements and open discussion about Tauri having [issues](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/discussions/4426) stopped me from trying it any further\r\n- Snapcraft: Really hard to set up, still testing. I am currently at more than 100 failed attempts\r\n- AppImage: A known bug prevents it from being uploaded: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7736\r\n\r\nI am sure if you are smart enough you are able to figure it out eventually, but for me, it's just very complicated to understand. I will keep on trying and see if I am able to achieve anything. If I do, I will try to remember to report back here.

Unfortunately, many AppImages that are perfectly functional don't pass this test, and therefore the automatic AppImage Workflow fails.\r\nTo fix this issue, I simply replaced the panic with a warning. This would still give feedback, but at least let the AppImage finish running. I encountered this issue [here](https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io/pull/3263) and mayn other users have as well in the issue #7736 \r\n\r\nBasically, I am reverting some changes of the
