This issue has been upstreamed from https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5279 \n\n### Describe the problem\n\nAs far as I can tell from the docs, concerning the theme of the window, there are JS APIs for only (1) [getting the window's current theme](https://tauri.app/v1/api/js/window/#theme), and (2) [listening to the system theme change](https://tauri.app/v1/api/js/window#onthemechanged).\r\n\r\nI'm trying to set the window's theme to \"dark\"/\"light\" as well when the user chooses the \"dark\"/\"light\" theme in my app.\r\n\r\n**Is there a way to dynamically change the theme of the window through JavaScript?**\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA JS API to change the theme of the window.\n\n###
