 /usr/include/thrift/thrift-config.h&lt;br/&gt;
containing all config.h stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody very familiar with that autotools stuff?&lt;br/&gt;
We need a patch...&lt;br/&gt;
;-r&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13546278" author="ben.craig" created="Mon, 7 Jan 2013 21:23:48 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I have seen other comments (don&apos;t recall where) mentioning that naming the file &quot;config.h&quot; causes problems elsewhere, specifically when interacting with python via C++.  Calling it thrift/config.h would probably be good enough, but going with a &quot;smurfy&quot; naming convention of thrift/thrift-config.h would definitely resolve the core issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I&apos;m not the autotools person for the job.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13547622" author="eyjian@gmail.com" created="Wed, 9 Jan 2013 04:28:11 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Maybe config.h should be removed from include directory, we should not&lt;br/&gt;
include config.h in public header files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a known problem for projects using autotools and has come up before in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-705&quot; title=&quot;Installed C++ header files depend on &amp;quot;config.h&amp;quot; which may have conflicting macros with the (autoconf based) C++ project using Thrift.&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;THRIFT-705&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;THRIFT-705&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where we went with the addition of ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H. There are 26 checks for this header in the lib/&lt;/p&gt;
{cpp,c_glib,php}
&lt;p&gt; code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attached is a patch which will wrap our config.h with #ifndef CONFIG_H to guard against duplicate definitions and also still allow people who would not have config.h to compile properly.  &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
