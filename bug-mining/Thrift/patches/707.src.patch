-Apache Thrift is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), 
-sponsored by the Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects 
-until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision 
-making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
-While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability 
-of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
