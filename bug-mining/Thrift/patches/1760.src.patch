 Note that the field name is not encoded so field renames in the IDL do not affect forward and backward compatibility.
 
 The default Java implementation (Apache Thrift 0.9.1) has undefined behavior when it tries to decode a field that has

 Other implementation may perform this check and then either ignore the field, or return a protocol exception.
 
 A *Union* is encoded exactly the same as a struct with the additional restriction that at most 1 field may be encoded.
