+For a given pattern, the same event may be assigned to multiple successful matches. To control to how many matches an event will be assigned, you need to specify the skip strategy called `AfterMatchSkipStrategy`. There are five types of skip strategies, listed as follows:
 
 * <strong>*NO_SKIP*</strong>: Every possible match will be emitted.
+* <strong>*SKIP_TO_NEXT*</strong>: Discards every partial match that started with the same event, emitted match was started.
 * <strong>*SKIP_PAST_LAST_EVENT*</strong>: Discards every partial match that started after the match started but before it ended.
 * <strong>*SKIP_TO_FIRST*</strong>: Discards every partial match that started after the match started but before the first event of *PatternName* occurred.
 * <strong>*SKIP_TO_LAST*</strong>: Discards every partial match that started after the match started but before the last event of *PatternName* occurred.
