 In order to build Flink, you need the source code. Either download the source of a release or clone the git repository. In addition to that, you need Maven 3 and a JDK (Java Development Kit). Note that you can not build Flink with Oracle JDK 6 due to a unresolved bug in the Oracle Java compiler. It works well with OpenJDK 6 and all Java 7 and 8 compilers.
