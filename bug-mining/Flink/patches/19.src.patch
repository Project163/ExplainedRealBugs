 # Common Options
 
 - `env.java.home`: The path to the Java installation to use (DEFAULT: system's
-default Java installation).
-- `jobmanager.rpc.address`: The IP address of the JobManager (DEFAULT:
-localhost).
+default Java installation, if found). Needs to be specified if the startup
+scipts fail to automatically resolve the java home directory. Can be specified
+to point to a specific java installation or version. If this option is not
+specified, the startup scripts also evaluate the `$JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
+
+- `jobmanager.rpc.address`: The IP address of the JobManager, which is the
+master/coordinator of the distributed system (DEFAULT: localhost).
+
 - `jobmanager.rpc.port`: The port number of the JobManager (DEFAULT: 6123).
+
 - `jobmanager.heap.mb`: JVM heap size (in megabytes) for the JobManager
 (DEFAULT: 256).
-- `taskmanager.heap.mb`: JVM heap size (in megabytes) for the TaskManager. In
-contrast to Hadoop, Stratosphere runs operators and functions inside the
-TaskManager (including sorting/hashing/caching), so this value should be as
-large as possible (DEFAULT: 512).
+
+- `taskmanager.heap.mb`: JVM heap size (in megabytes) for the TaskManagers,
+which are the parallel workers of the system. In
+contrast to Hadoop, Flink runs operators (e.g., join, aggregate) and
+user-defined functions (e.g., Map, Reduce, CoGroup) inside the TaskManager
+(including sorting/hashing/caching), so this value should be as
+large as possible (DEFAULT: 512). On YARN setups, this value is automatically
+configured to the size of the TaskManager's YARN container, minus a
+certain tolerance value.
+
+- `taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots`: The number of parallel operator or
+UDF instances that a single TaskManager can run (DEFAULT: 1).
+If this value is larger than 1, a single TaskManager takes multiple instances of
+a function or operator. That way, the TaskManager can utilize multiple CPU cores,
+but at the same time, the available memory is divided between the different
+operator or function instances.
+This value is typically proportional to the number of physical CPU cores that
+the TaskManager's machine has (e.g., equal to the number of cores, or half the
+number of cores).
+
+- `parallelization.degree.default`: The default degree of parallelism to use for
+programs that have no degree of parallelism specified. (DEFAULT: 1). For
+setups that have no concurrent jobs running, setting this value to
+NumTaskManagers * NumSlotsPerTaskManager will cause the system to use all
+available execution resources for the program's execution.
+
+- `fs.hdfs.hadoopconf`: The absolute path to the Hadoop File System's (HDFS)
+configuration directory (OPTIONAL VALUE).
+Specifying this value allows programs to reference HDFS files using short URIs
+(`hdfs:///path/to/files`, without including the address and port of the NameNode
+in the file URI). Without this option, HDFS files can be accessed, but require
+fully qualified URIs like `hdfs://address:port/path/to/files`.
+This option also causes file writers to pick up the HDFS's default values for block sizes
+and replication factors. Flink will look for the "core-site.xml" and
+"hdfs-site.xml" files in teh specified directory.
+
+
+# Advanced Options
+
 - `taskmanager.tmp.dirs`: The directory for temporary files, or a list of
 directories separated by the systems directory delimiter (for example ':'
-(colon) on Linux/Unix). If multiple directories are specified then the temporary
-files will be distributed across the directories in a round robin fashion. The
+(colon) on Linux/Unix). If multiple directories are specified, then the temporary
+files will be distributed across the directories in a round-robin fashion. The
 I/O manager component will spawn one reading and one writing thread per
 directory. A directory may be listed multiple times to have the I/O manager use
 multiple threads for it (for example if it is physically stored on a very fast
 disc or RAID) (DEFAULT: The system's tmp dir).
-- `parallelization.degree.default`: The default degree of parallelism to use for
-programs that have no degree of parallelism specified. A value of -1 indicates
-no limit, in which the degree of parallelism is set to the number of available
-instances at the time of compilation (DEFAULT: -1).
-- `parallelization.intra-node.default`: The number of parallel instances of an
-operation that are assigned to each TaskManager. A value of -1 indicates no
-limit (DEFAULT: -1).
+
+- `jobmanager.web.port`: Port of the JobManager's web interface (DEFAULT: 8081).
+
+- `fs.overwrite-files`: Specifies whether file output writers should overwrite
+existing files by default. Set to *true* to overwrite by default, *false* otherwise.
+(DEFAULT: false)
+
+- `fs.output.always-create-directory`: File writers running with a parallelism
+larger than one create a directory for the output file path and put the different
+result files (one per parallel writer task) into that directory. If this option
+is set to *true*, writers with a parallelism of 1 will also create a directory
+and place a single result file into it. If the option is set to *false*, the
+writer will directly create the file directly at the output path, without
+creating a containing directory. (DEFAULT: false)
+
 - `taskmanager.network.numberOfBuffers`: The number of buffers available to the
 network stack. This number determines how many streaming data exchange channels
 a TaskManager can have at the same time and how well buffered the channels are.
 If a job is rejected or you get a warning that the system has not enough buffers
 available, increase this value (DEFAULT: 2048).
+
 - `taskmanager.memory.size`: The amount of memory (in megabytes) that the task
+manager reserves on the JVM's heap space for sorting, hash tables, and caching
+of intermediate results. If unspecified (-1), the memory manager will take a fixed
+ratio of the heap memory available to the JVM, as specified by
+`taskmanager.memory.fraction`. (DEFAULT: -1)
+
+- `taskmanager.memory.fraction`: The relative amount of memory that the task
 manager reserves for sorting, hash tables, and caching of intermediate results.
-If unspecified (-1), the memory manager will take a fixed ratio of the heap
-memory available to the JVM after the allocation of the network buffers (0.8)
-(DEFAULT: -1).
-- `jobmanager.profiling.enable`: Flag to enable job manager's profiling
-component. This collects network/cpu utilization statistics, which are displayed
-as charts in the SWT visualization GUI (DEFAULT: false).
-
-# HDFS
-
-These parameters configure the default HDFS used by Stratosphere. If you don't
-specify a HDFS configuration, you will have to specify the full path to your
-HDFS files like `hdfs://address:port/path/to/files` and filed with be written
+For example, a value of 0.8 means that TaskManagers reserve 80% of the
+JVM's heap space for internal data buffers, leaving 20% of the JVM's heap space
+free for objects created by user-defined functions. (DEFAULT: 0.7)
+This parameter is only evaluated, if `taskmanager.memory.size` is not set.
