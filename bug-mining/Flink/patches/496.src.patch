 The web interface can also handle multiple Flink jobs within a single jar file. To use this feature, package all required class files of all jobs into a single jar and specify the entry classes for each job as comma-separated-values in *program-class* argument within the jar's manifest file. The job view displays each entry class and you can pick any of them to preview the plan and/or submit the job to the JobManager.
