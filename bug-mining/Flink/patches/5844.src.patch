-**Note:** The event-time temporal join requires the primary key contained in the equivalence condition of the temporal join condition, e.g., The primary key `P.product_id` of table `product_changelog` to be constrained in the condition `O.product_id = P.product_id`.

 In contrast to [regular joins](#regular-joins), the previous temporal table results will not be affected despite the changes on the build side.
 Compared to [interval joins](#interval-joins), temporal table joins do not define a time window within which the records will be joined.
