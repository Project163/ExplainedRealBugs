+This connector provides a Source and Sink that can read from and write to
+[Google Cloud PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub). To use this connector, add the
+following dependency to your project:
+
+{% highlight xml %}
+<dependency>
+  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
+  <artifactId>flink-connector-gcp-pubsub{{ site.scala_version_suffix }}</artifactId>
+  <version>{{ site.version }}</version>
+</dependency>
+{% endhighlight %}
+
+<p style="border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px" class="bg-danger">
+<b>Note</b>: This connector has been added to Flink recently. It has not received widespread testing yet.
+</p>
+
+Note that the streaming connectors are currently not part of the binary
+distribution. See
+[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/projectsetup/dependencies.html)
+for information about how to package the program with the libraries for
+cluster execution.
+
+
+
+## Consuming or Producing PubSubMessages
+
+The connector provides a connectors for receiving and sending messages from and to Google PubSub.
+Google PubSub has an `at-least-once` guarantee and as such the connector delivers the same guarantees.
+
+### PubSub SourceFunction
+
+The class `PubSubSource` has a builder to create PubSubsources: `PubSubSource.newBuilder(...)`
+
+There are several optional methods to alter how the PubSubSource is created, the bare minimum is to provide a Google project, Pubsub subscription and a way to deserialize the PubSubMessages.
+
+Example:
+
+<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
+<div data-lang="java" markdown="1">
+{% highlight java %}
+StreamExecutionEnvironment streamExecEnv = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
+
+DeserializationSchema<SomeObject> deserializer = (...);
+SourceFunction<SomeObject> pubsubSource = PubSubSource.newBuilder()
+                                                      .withDeserializationSchema(deserializer)
+                                                      .withProjectName("project")
+                                                      .withSubscriptionName("subscription")
+                                                      .build();
+
+streamExecEnv.addSource(source);
+{% endhighlight %}
+</div>
+</div>
+
+Currently the source functions [pulls](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pull) messages from PubSub, [push endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/push) are not supported.
+
+### PubSub Sink
+
+The class `PubSubSink` has a builder to create PubSubSinks. `PubSubSink.newBuilder(...)`
+
+This builder works in a similar way to the PubSubSource.
+
+Example:
+
+<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
+<div data-lang="java" markdown="1">
+{% highlight java %}
+DataStream<SomeObject> dataStream = (...);
+
+SerializationSchema<SomeObject> serializationSchema = (...);
+SinkFunction<SomeObject> pubsubSink = PubSubSink.newBuilder()
+                                                .withDeserializationSchema(deserializer)
+                                                .withProjectName("project")
+                                                .withSubscriptionName("subscription")
+                                                .build()
+
+dataStream.addSink(pubsubSink);
+{% endhighlight %}
+</div>
+</div>
+
+### Google Credentials
+
+Google uses [Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) to authenticate and authorize applications so that they can use Google Cloud Platform resources (such as PubSub).
+
+Both builders allow you to provide these credentials but by default the connectors will look for an environment variable: [GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#obtaining_and_providing_service_account_credentials_manually) which should point to a file containing the credentials.
+
+If you want to provide Credentials manually, for instance if you read the Credentials yourself from an external system, you can use `PubSubSource.newBuilder(...).withCredentials(...)`.
+
+### Integration testing
+
+When running integration tests you might not want to connect to PubSub directly but use a docker container to read and write to. (See: [PubSub testing locally](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator))
+
+The following example shows how you would create a source to read messages from the emulator and send them back:
+<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
+<div data-lang="java" markdown="1">
+{% highlight java %}
+DeserializationSchema<SomeObject> deserializationSchema = (...);
+SourceFunction<SomeObject> pubsubSource = PubSubSource.newBuilder()
+                                                      .withDeserializationSchema(deserializationSchema)
+                                                      .withProjectName("my-fake-project")
+                                                      .withSubscriptionName("subscription")
+                                                      .withPubSubSubscriberFactory(new PubSubSubscriberFactoryForEmulator("localhost:1234", "my-fake-project", "subscription", 10, Duration.ofSeconds(15), 100))
+                                                      .build();
+SinkFunction<SomeObject> pubsubSink = PubSubSink.newBuilder()
+                                                .withDeserializationSchema(deserializationSchema)
+                                                .withProjectName("my-fake-project")
+                                                .withSubscriptionName("subscription")
+                                                .withHostAndPortForEmulator(getPubSubHostPort())
+                                                .build()
+
+StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
+env.addSource(pubsubSource)
+   .addSink(pubsubSink);
+{% endhighlight %}
+</div>
+</div>
+
+### Atleast once guarantee
+
+#### SourceFunction
+
+There are several reasons why a message might be send multiple times, such as failure scenarios on Google PubSub's side.
+
+Another reason is when the acknowledgement deadline has passed. This is the time between receiving the message and between acknowledging the message. The PubSubSource will only acknowledge a message on successful checkpoints to guarantee Atleast-Once. This does mean if the time between successful checkpoints is larger than the acknowledgment deadline of your subscription messages will most likely be processed multiple times.
+
+For this reason it's recommended to have a (much) lower checkpoint interval than acknowledgement deadline.
+
+See [PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber) for details on how to increase the acknowledgment deadline of your subscription.
+
+Note: The metric `PubSubMessagesProcessedNotAcked` shows how many messages are waiting for the next checkpoint before they will be acknowledged.
+
+#### SinkFunction
+
+The sink function buffers messages that are to be send to PubSub for a short amount of time for performance reasons. Before each checkpoint this buffer is flushed and the checkpoint will not succeed unless the messages have been delivered to PubSub.
