-  **Important**: if you are running multiple Flink HA clusters, you have to manually configure separate cluster-ids for each cluster. By default, the Yarn cluster and the Yarn session automatically generate cluster-ids based on Yarn application id. A manual configuration overrides this behaviour in Yarn. Specifying a cluster-id with the -z CLI option, in turn, overrides manual configuration.
