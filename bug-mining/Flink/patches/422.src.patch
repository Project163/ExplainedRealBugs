+The streaming mode changes the startup behavior of Flink: The system is not

+Flink streaming is not using the managed memory employed by the batch operators.
+By not starting these services with preallocated memory, streaming jobs can benefit

+Note that you can still start batch jobs in the streaming mode. The memory manager
+will then allocate memory segments from the Java heap as needed.

 ## Flink on Windows
 
 If you want to run Flink on Windows you need to download, unpack and configure the Flink archive as mentioned above. After that you can either use the **Windows Batch** file (`.bat`) or use **Cygwin**  to run the Flink Jobmanager.
