 Currently, Flink only supports jobs containing Lambda Expressions completely if they are **compiled with the Eclipse JDT compiler contained in Eclipse Luna 4.4.2 (and above)**.
 
 Only the Eclipse JDT compiler preserves the generic type information necessary to use the entire Lambda Expressions feature type-safely.
-Other compilers such as the OpenJDK's and Oracle JDK's `javac` throw away all generic parameters related to Lambda Expressions. This means that types such as `Tuple2<String,Integer` or `Collector<String>` declared as a Lambda function input or output parameter will be pruned to `Tuple2` or `Collector` in the compiled `.class` files, which is too little information for the Flink Compiler.

 How to compile a Flink job that contains Lambda Expressions with the JDT compiler will be covered in the next section.
