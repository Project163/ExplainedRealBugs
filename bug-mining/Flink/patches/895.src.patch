 ### Managed Memory
 
-By default, Flink allocates a fraction of 0.7 of the total memory configured via `taskmanager.heap.mb` for its managed memory. Managed memory helps Flink to run the operators efficiently. It prevents OutOfMemoryExceptions because Flink knows how much memory it can use to execute operations. If Flink runs out of managed memory, it utilizes disk space. Using managed memory, some operations can be performed directly on the raw data without having to deserialize the data to convert it into Java objects. All in all, managed memory improves the robustness and speed of the system.
+By default, Flink allocates a fraction of `0.7` of the total memory configured via `taskmanager.heap.mb` for its managed memory. Managed memory helps Flink to run the operators efficiently. It prevents `OutOfMemoryException`s because Flink knows how much memory it can use to execute operations. If Flink runs out of managed memory, it utilizes disk space. Using managed memory, some operations can be performed directly on the raw data without having to deserialize the data to convert it into Java objects. All in all, managed memory improves the robustness and speed of the system.
 
 The default fraction for managed memory can be adjusted using the `taskmanager.memory.fraction` parameter. An absolute value may be set using `taskmanager.memory.size` (overrides the fraction parameter). If desired, the managed memory may be allocated outside the JVM heap. This may improve performance in setups with large memory sizes.
 
-- `taskmanager.memory.size`: The amount of memory (in megabytes) that the task manager reserves on the JVM's heap space for sorting, hash tables, and caching of intermediate results. If unspecified (-1), the memory manager will take a fixed ratio of the heap memory available to the JVM, as specified by `taskmanager.memory.fraction`. (DEFAULT: -1)
+- `taskmanager.memory.size`: The amount of memory (in megabytes) that the task manager reserves on-heap or off-heap (depending on `taskmanager.memory.off-heap`) for sorting, hash tables, and caching of intermediate results. If unspecified (-1), the memory manager will take a fixed ratio with respect to the size of the task manager JVM as specified by `taskmanager.memory.fraction`. (DEFAULT: -1)
 
-- `taskmanager.memory.fraction`: The relative amount of memory that the task manager reserves for sorting, hash tables, and caching of intermediate results. For example, a value of 0.8 means that TaskManagers reserve 80% of the JVM's heap space for internal data buffers, leaving 20% of the JVM's heap space free for objects created by user-defined functions. (DEFAULT: 0.7) This parameter is only evaluated, if `taskmanager.memory.size` is not set.

 - `taskmanager.memory.off-heap`: If set to `true`, the task manager allocates memory which is used for sorting, hash tables, and caching of intermediate results outside of the JVM heap. For setups with larger quantities of memory, this can improve the efficiency of the operations performed on the memory (DEFAULT: false).
