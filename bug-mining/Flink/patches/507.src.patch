 ## Finite Storm Spouts
 
-In Flink streaming, sources can be finite - i.e. emit a finite number of records and stop after emitting the last record -, however, Storm spouts always emit infinite streams.
+In Flink streaming, sources can be finite &ndash; i.e., emit a finite number of records and stop after emitting the last record &ndash;, however, Storm spouts always emit infinite streams.
 The bridge between the two approach is the `FiniteStormSpout` interface which, in addition to `IRichSpout`, contains a `reachedEnd()` method, where the user can specify a stopping-condition.
 The user can create a finite Storm spout by implementing this interface instead of `IRichSpout`, and implementing the `reachedEnd()`method in addition.
-When used as part of a Flink topology, a `FiniteStormSpout` should be wrapped in a `FiniteStormSpoutWrapper` class.

 Although finite Storm spouts are not necessary to embed Storm spouts into a Flink streaming program or to submit a whole Storm topology to Flink, there are cases where they may come in handy:
