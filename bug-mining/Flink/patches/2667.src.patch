 The Table API shares many concepts and parts of its API with Flink's SQL integration. Have a look at the [Common Concepts & API]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/table/common.html) to learn how to register tables or to create a `Table` object. The [Streaming Concepts](./streaming) pages discuss streaming specific concepts such as dynamic tables and time attributes.
