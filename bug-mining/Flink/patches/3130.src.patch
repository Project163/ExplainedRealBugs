 Flink's `HiveCatalog` officially supports Hive 2.3.4 and 1.2.1.
 
 The Hive version is explicitly specified as a String, either by passing it to the constructor when creating `HiveCatalog` instances directly in Table API or specifying it in yaml config file in SQL CLI. The Hive version string are `2.3.4` and `1.2.1`.

 Note that Hive Metastore stores meta-object names in lower cases. Thus, unlike `GenericInMemoryCatalog`, `HiveCatalog` is case-insensitive to meta-object names, and users need to be cautious on that.
