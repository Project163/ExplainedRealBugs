 - `jobmanager.rpc.address`: The IP address of the JobManager, which is the master/coordinator of the distributed system (DEFAULT: **localhost**).
 - `jobmanager.rpc.port`: The port number of the JobManager (DEFAULT: **6123**).
 - `taskmanager.hostname`: The hostname of the network interface that the TaskManager binds to. By default, the TaskManager searches for network interfaces that can connect to the JobManager and other TaskManagers. This option can be used to define a hostname if that strategy fails for some reason. Because different TaskManagers need different values for this option, it usually is specified in an additional non-shared TaskManager-specific config file.
-- `taskmanager.rpc.port`: The task manager's IPC port (DEFAULT: **6122**).
-- `taskmanager.data.port`: The task manager's port used for data exchange operations (DEFAULT: **6121**).
+- `taskmanager.rpc.port`: The task manager's IPC port (DEFAULT: **0**, which lets the OS choose a free port).
+- `taskmanager.data.port`: The task manager's port used for data exchange operations (DEFAULT: **0**, which lets the OS choose a free port).
 - `jobmanager.heap.mb`: JVM heap size (in megabytes) for the JobManager (DEFAULT: **256**).
 - `taskmanager.heap.mb`: JVM heap size (in megabytes) for the TaskManagers, which are the parallel workers of the system. In contrast to Hadoop, Flink runs operators (e.g., join, aggregate) and user-defined functions (e.g., Map, Reduce, CoGroup) inside the TaskManager (including sorting/hashing/caching), so this value should be as large as possible (DEFAULT: **512**). On YARN setups, this value is automatically configured to the size of the TaskManager's YARN container, minus a certain tolerance value.
 - `taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots`: The number of parallel operator or user function instances that a single TaskManager can run (DEFAULT: **1**). If this value is larger than 1, a single TaskManager takes multiple instances of a function or operator. That way, the TaskManager can utilize multiple CPU cores, but at the same time, the available memory is divided between the different operator or function instances. This value is typically proportional to the number of physical CPU cores that the TaskManager's machine has (e.g., equal to the number of cores, or half the number of cores).
