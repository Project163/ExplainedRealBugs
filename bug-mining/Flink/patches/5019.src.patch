 #### Unaligned checkpoint recovery may lead to corrupted data stream [FLINK-20654](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-20654)
 
-Using UnalignedCheckpoints in Flink 1.12.0 combined with two/multiple inputs tasks or with union inputs for single input tasks can result in corrupted state.
+Using unaligned checkpoints in Flink 1.12.0 combined with two/multiple inputs tasks or with union inputs for single input tasks can result in corrupted state.
 
 This can happen if a new checkpoint is triggered before recovery is fully completed. For state to be corrupted a task with two or more input gates must receive a checkpoint barrier exactly at the same time this tasks finishes recovering spilled in-flight data. In such case this new checkpoint can succeed, with corrupted/missing in-flight data, which will result in various deserialisation/corrupted data stream errors when someone attempts to recover from such corrupted checkpoint.
 
+Using unaligned checkpoints in Flink 1.12.1, a corruption may occur in the checkpoint following a declined checkpoint.
+
+A late barrier of a canceled checkpoint may lead to buffers being not written into the successive checkpoint, such that recovery is not possible. This happens, when the next checkpoint barrier arrives at a given operator before all previous barriers arrived, which can only happen after cancellation in unaligned checkpoints.
