+Flink offers a web interface for submitting and executing jobs. The interface is part of the JobManager's
+web interface for monitoring, per default running on port 8081. Job submission via this interfaces requires
+that you have set `jobmanager.web.submit.enable: true` in `flink-conf.yaml`.
 
-The script to start the webinterface is located under ```bin/start-webclient.sh```. After starting the webclient (per default on **port 8080**), your program can be uploaded and will be added to the list of available programs on the left side of the interface.
