+## Configuring ClassLoader Resolution Order
+
+Flink uses a hierarchy of ClassLoaders for loading classes from the user-code jar(s). The user-code
+ClassLoader has a reference to the parent ClassLoader, which is the default Java ClassLoader in most
+cases. By default, Java ClassLoaders will first look for classes in the parent ClassLoader and then in
+the child ClassLoader for cases where we have a hierarchy of ClassLoaders. This is problematic if you
+have in your user jar a version of a library that conflicts with a version that comes with Flink. You can
+change this behaviour by configuring the ClassLoader resolution order via
+`classloader.resolve-order: child-first` in the Flink config. However, Flink classes will still
+be resolved through the parent ClassLoader first, although you can also configure this via
+`classloader.parent-first-patterns` (see [config](../ops/config.html))

 It usually works to put the job's JAR file into the `/lib` directory. The JAR will be part of both the classpath
