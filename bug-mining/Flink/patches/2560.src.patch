 Images for each supported combination of Hadoop and Scala are available, and
 tag aliases are provided for convenience.
 
-For example, the following aliases can be used: *(`1.2.y` indicates the latest
-release of Flink 1.2)*
+Beginning with Flink 1.5, image tags that omit a Hadoop version (e.g.
+`-hadoop28`) correspond to Hadoop-free releases of Flink that do not include a
+bundled Hadoop distribution.
 
-* `flink:latest` →
-`flink:<latest-flink>-hadoop<latest-hadoop>-scala_<latest-scala>`
-* `flink:1.2` → `flink:1.2.y-hadoop27-scala_2.11`
-* `flink:1.2.1-scala_2.10` → `flink:1.2.1-hadoop27-scala_2.10`
-* `flink:1.2-hadoop26` → `flink:1.2.y-hadoop26-scala_2.11`
+For example, the following aliases can be used: *(`1.5.y` indicates the latest
+release of Flink 1.5)*

-Additionally, images based on Alpine Linux are available. Reference them by
-appending `-alpine` to the tag. For the Alpine version of `flink:latest`, use
-`flink:alpine`.
