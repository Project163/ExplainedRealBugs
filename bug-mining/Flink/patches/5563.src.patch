 We removed deprecated state access methods `RuntimeContext#getFoldingState()`, `OperatorStateStore#getSerializableListState()` and `OperatorStateStore#getOperatorState()`.
 This means that some code that was compiled against Flink 1.10 will not work with a Flink 1.11 cluster.
-An example of this is our Kafka connector which internally used `OperatorStateStore.getSerializableListState`.

+The semantics for accumulators have now changed in `MiniClusterJobClient` to fix this bug and comply with other JobClient implementations:
+Previously `MiniClusterJobClient` assumed that `getAccumulator()` was called on a bounded pipeline and that the user wanted to acquire the final
+accumulator values after the job is finished.
+But now it returns the current value of accumulators immediately to be compatible with unbounded pipelines.
