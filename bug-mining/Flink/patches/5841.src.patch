+     * can rely on the fact that this method has completed (for example to ignore exceptions that

+     * <p>During graceful shutdown (for example stopping a job with a savepoint), the program must
+     * cleanly exit the {@link #run(SourceContext)} method soon after this method was called. The
+     * Flink runtime will NOT interrupt the source thread during graceful shutdown. Source
+     * implementors must ensure that no thread interruption happens on any thread that emits records
+     * through the {@code SourceContext} from the {@link #run(SourceContext)} method; otherwise the
+     * clean shutdown may fail when threads are interrupted while processing the final records.
+     *
+     * <p>Because the {@code SourceFunction} cannot easily differentiate whether the shutdown should
+     * be graceful or ungraceful, we recommend that implementors refrain from interrupting any
+     * threads that interact with the {@code SourceContext} at all. You can rely on the Flink
+     * runtime to interrupt the source thread in case of ungraceful cancellation. Any additionally
+     * spawned threads that directly emit records through the {@code SourceContext} should use a
+     * shutdown method that does not rely on thread interruption.
