 ### Difference to Savepoints
 
 Externalized checkpoints have a few differences from [savepoints](savepoints.html). They
-- use a state backend specific (low-level) data format,
-- may be incremental,
+- use a state backend specific (low-level) data format, may be incremental.

 Upon checkpoints, this state backend will snapshot the state and send it as part of the checkpoint acknowledgement messages to the
