 ### Preparation
 
 This *Getting Started* section assumes a functional YARN environment, starting from version 2.4.1. YARN environments are provided most conveniently through services such as Amazon EMR, Google Cloud DataProc or products like Cloudera. [Manually setting up a YARN environment locally](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html) or [on a cluster](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html) is not recommended for following through this *Getting Started* tutorial.
