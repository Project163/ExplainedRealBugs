+## Building in encrypted filesystems
+
+If your home directory is encrypted you might encounter a `java.io.IOException: File 
+name too long` exception. Some encrypted file systems, like encfs used by Ubuntu, do not allow
+long filenames, which is the cause of this error.
+
+The workaround is to add:
+
+~~~xml
+<args>
+    <arg>-Xmax-classfile-name</arg>
+    <arg>128</arg>
+</args>
+~~~
+
+in the compiler configuration of the `pom.xml` file of the module causing the error. For example,
+if the error appears in the `flink-yarn` module, the above code should 
+be added under the `<configuration>` tag of `scala-maven-plugin`. See 
+[this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2003) for more information.
