            <title>[FLINK-20632] Missing docker images for 1.12 release</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-20632</link>
                <project id="12315522" key="FLINK">Flink</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Images for Flink 1.12 are missing in Docker hub &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/_/flink&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://hub.docker.com/_/flink&lt;/a&gt;. As a result Kubernetes deployment as in the documentation example is not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker Hub requires all official images to go through a review process. The official image for Flink 1.12 is still in review. You can track the progress on the following pull request.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/9249&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/9249&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;It will be available once the PR is merged.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;git clone &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/flink-docker&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/flink-docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
cd flink-docker/&lt;br/&gt;
cd 1.12/scala_2.12-java8-debian/&lt;br/&gt;
docker build -t flink:1.12.0 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also pushed an image to DockerHub as: &quot;rmetzger/flink:1.12.0-unofficial&quot;. This is an unofficial image, not an official apache release!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;What we could also consider hosting the Flink images in another registry (for example GitHub). The command for pulling the image would be something like docker pull ghcr.io/apache/flink:1.12.0.&lt;br/&gt;
We could even extend this to nightly builds as well.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The current problem with releasing before the docker image is available is that the native K8s integration does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing snapshot docker images is a very good improvement imo.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17251070" author="dian.fu" created="Thu, 17 Dec 2020 13:08:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Providing snapshot docker images seems a good idea. Otherwise, I&apos;m afraid that the release process may still not be rolled back even if we find that there are some problems during publishing to official images as artifacts such as the jars may have already been deployed to the maven central repo.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Correct me if I am wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17254187" author="zentol" created="Wed, 23 Dec 2020 18:32:13 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=fly_in_gis&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;fly_in_gis&quot;&gt;fly_in_gis&lt;/a&gt; It&apos;s not that we can&apos;t have snapshot images, but that we can&apos;t advertise them to users; so it wouldn&apos;t really help in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have to find a way though to ensure we can release the docker images on the day of the release, but it&apos;s a bit of a chicken-egg problem. We can&apos;t open a proper PR against the official images repo before the release is out (because the image couldn&apos;t download the corresponding release), but we don&apos;t to release before the image being accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m wondering whether we could just move all of the docker logic into a script that lives in the distribution, and we just defer to that script in the image. If we could make this work we could save ourselves a lot of hassle from keeping Flink and flink-docker in sync.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17255477" author="till.rohrmann" created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 09:09:14 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=chesnay&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;chesnay&quot;&gt;chesnay&lt;/a&gt; maybe it is enough to postpone the release announcement until the Docker PR is merged. That way we can first complete the Flink release, then update the Docker image and lastly announce the release which makes it effectively available to our users.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17255493" author="xintongsong" created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 09:45:58 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Does our PMC has the authority to remove artifacts from the apache &lt;b&gt;release&lt;/b&gt; svn repository, say if we have not announced it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m asking because, IIUC building docker images requires downloading the release from the &lt;b&gt;release&lt;/b&gt;&#160;svn repository. And if the official-image review process requires updating Flink&apos;s source codes, we would need to remove the invalid release from the repository.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17255500" author="till.rohrmann" created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 09:56:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Ideally, we wouldn&apos;t have to modify Flink because of the Docker image. I guess that the main part which is being reviewed are the &lt;tt&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/tt&gt; and the entrypoint start script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a change to Flink&apos;s source code is needed, then we could also create a new bug fix release right away.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17255503" author="till.rohrmann" created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 10:05:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;But maybe hosting the Flink docker images somewhere else will decouple our release process from Dockerhub which already does the trick. In any case, I think we need to solve this problem for the next release, because it is now already 2 weeks since the 1.12.0 release and people trying out the K8s integration will fail because of the missing Docker image.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17255539" author="zentol" created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 11:39:09 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;maybe it is enough to postpone the release announcement until the Docker PR is merged. That way we can first complete the Flink release, then update the Docker image and lastly announce the release which makes it effectively available to our users.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would we have delayed the release for 2+ weeks because the docker images aren&apos;t being released?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Does our PMC has the authority to remove artifacts from the apache release svn repository, say if we have not announced it&lt;/cite&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;But maybe hosting the Flink docker images somewhere else will decouple our release process from Dockerhub which already does the trick.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it would solve the issue I do somewhat like going through the official-images review process as an additional QA. We aren&apos;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; familiar with docker conventions, and the issue they pointed out does make sense after all.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

We aren&apos;t really familiar with docker conventions, and the issue they pointed out does make sense after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of agree with thinking the official image as an additional QA. Technically speaking the official docker image is not even part of the Apache Flink release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker Official Images are an intellectual property of Docker. Distributing Docker Official Images without a prior agreement can constitute a violation of Docker Terms of Service.&lt;/p&gt;

At least from the user perspective it seems odd to me that Flink 1.12 has been released but it does not work out of the box with K8s. This is also illustrated by three duplicated tickets which have been opened for the missing Docker images.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17255569" author="xintongsong" created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 12:42:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;True, it&apos;s hard to explain to users that the official docker image is not part of the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to include an image (e.g., a tar file) in our release, so that the K8s integration can work out of box? That would make the docker hub official image an available choice rather than a release dependency. I guess it&apos;s a trade-off between the complexity to maintain and ship our own image and the risk of depending our release on a third-party process.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17255585" author="till.rohrmann" created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 13:20:56 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think that Robert&apos;s proposal with hosting the Docker image ourselves could work and solve the problem of having the release and the Docker image currently separated. The down side of this approach is that we might lose visibility which we currently have with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://hub.docker.com/&lt;/a&gt; as a well known Docker image registry. But we could still publish our images to this registry as well at the cost of a duplicated Docker image which might confuse users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively we could keep things as they are and hope that the future review process won&apos;t take that long. With Chesnay&apos;s proposal to move most of the entrypoint script into the Flink repository we might be able to reduce the number of things maintainers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/docker-library/official-images&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/docker-library/official-images&lt;/a&gt; might comment on.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure if this is because of the Christmas vacation or not. I do see there are new PRs got merged recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shall we consider hosting the Docker image ourselves starting 1.12.1?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17258079" author="till.rohrmann" created="Mon, 4 Jan 2021 09:09:10 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think the lack of responsiveness is due to Christmas and New Years. However, it shows our dependence on these guys. Hence, I am more and more inclined to host the Docker images on a registry which we control or can at least upload images at our need. So maybe the answer is to not host the Flink images as official images on hub.docker.com.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17258107" author="xintongsong" created="Mon, 4 Jan 2021 09:46:47 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;+1 on hosting the image on a registry that we control.&lt;/p&gt;

We noticed that we might need to change &lt;tt&gt;KubernetesConfigOptions#getDefaultFlinkImage&lt;/tt&gt; to point to our registry by default. I&apos;d like to include this code change in 1.12.1, unless the 1.12.0 image got approved before this (indicating we probably won&apos;t have problems with the 1.12.1 image).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we need to first investigate, decide and setup the new register.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The only&#160;advantage of docker hub official image is that users could save the words when specifying image name(e.g. flink:1.11.3 vs ghcr.io/apache/flink:1.11.3).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

It might be worth hosting the image somwhere else so that it is available on the day of the release. This will allow the developers use it right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time for some production systems only verified official images may be allowed, so having an official image will bring value. However, these systems will wait for the offcial image and won&apos;t even use the latest version anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Pushing there will be part of the official release process.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I got the following error when trying to pull the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
$ docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/apache/flink/flink:1.11-scala_2.11-java11
Error response from daemon: Head https:&lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;//docker.pkg.github.com/v2/apache/flink/flink/manifests/1.11-scala_2.11-java11: no basic auth credentials&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I noticed that Github puts a `Latest version` green tag besides `1.11-scala_2.11-java11 Latest version`, on the all versions page.&lt;br/&gt;
Does that mean people get this image when pulling with `docker.pkg.github.com/apache/flink/flink:latest`?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The latest tag will work similarly to packages hosted on Docker Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just realized that the images pushed to the legacy GitHub Packages are not pullable by unauthenticated users. You need to be logged in to GitHub to pull the images, even if they are public...&lt;br/&gt;
GitHub Container Registry supports pulling images without authentication. But GitHub Container Registry is not supported by the ASF GitHub Account: INFRA-20959&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17259705" author="rmetzger" created="Wed, 6 Jan 2021 13:18:48 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think that we will be able to use the GitHub Container Registry with the official Apache GitHub account, because Infra won&apos;t allow it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the following options (ordered by my preference)&lt;br/&gt;
1. Use GitHub Container Registry from any GitHub account (project-flink), or &quot;flinkbot&quot; which is an account controlled by the PMC&lt;br/&gt;
Downsides: Flink committers won&apos;t be able to push images there: They need to be added manually to the account. Also, the name of the container will be a bit weird: docker.pkg.github.com/project-flink/flink/flink:1.12.0-scala_2.11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Use a 3rd party DockerHub account (create new &quot;flink&quot; account)&lt;br/&gt;
Downsides: There are potentially confusions because there will be a real official and a semi official image on Docker Hub. Committers won&apos;t have access immediately (like approach 1). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. (current) Use GitHub Packages of apache/flink: Users need to provide Image Pull Credentials with their GitHub Account&lt;br/&gt;
Downsides: users have a poor experience, because GitHub credentials are needed to pull.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;m currently leaning towards 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO, once we start going down the road of 1 or 2, we should just stop dealing with official-images imo to avoid confusion and overhead.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17259827" author="rmetzger" created="Wed, 6 Jan 2021 15:52:24 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s actually another option: We can request an &quot;apache/flink&quot; DockerHub repository from the &quot;apache&quot; user: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/u/apache&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://hub.docker.com/u/apache&lt;/a&gt; (via INFRA)&lt;br/&gt;
That&apos;s probably the cleanest solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand your argument Chesnay, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=peperg&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;peperg&quot;&gt;peperg&lt;/a&gt; raised the point that some companies are only using official images. For that reason, I believe we should, at least for now, go with the ugly approach of publishing the images to two locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will request an &quot;apache/flink&quot; DockerHub repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are available here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/flink&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/flink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image is available as &quot;apache/flink&quot; instead of &quot;flink&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
Running &quot;docker run -it apache/flink:1.12 jobmanager&quot; starts a JobManager&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

 I&apos;m wondering, shall we also secure the `apache/flink` images with our release manager&apos;s signatures?&lt;br/&gt;
 I noticed that the previous official-images are signed with administrative keys, while our new images are not.&lt;/p&gt;

I can sign an image with a key generated by the command `docker trust key generate`, but that would be different from what we put in the KEYS file.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;It might be worth hosting the image somwhere else so that it is available&lt;br/&gt;
on the day of the release. This will allow the developers use it right away.&lt;br/&gt;
At the same time for some production systems only veridied official images&lt;br/&gt;
may be allowed, so having an official image will bring value. However,&lt;br/&gt;
these systems will wait for the offcial image and won&apos;t even use the latest&lt;br/&gt;
version anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
