                    <description>&lt;p&gt;During testing of Flink in Kubernetes Application mode, an issue was encountered when submitting SQL scripts using the &lt;b&gt;SQL Client Embedded Mode&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SQL Client JAR is included in the &lt;tt&gt;--jar&lt;/tt&gt; parameter by default. This parameter is converted to &lt;tt&gt;user.artifacts.artifact-list . And we will get the following exception.&#160;&lt;/tt&gt;{{}}&lt;/p&gt;
