            <title>[FLINK-4133] Reflect streaming file source changes in documentation</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-4133</link>
                <project id="12315522" key="FLINK">Flink</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2314&quot; title=&quot;Make Streaming File Sources Persistent&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;FLINK-2314&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;FLINK-2314&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the file sources for the DataStream API were reworked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation doesn&apos;t explain the (new?) semantics of the file sources.&lt;br/&gt;
In which order are files read?&lt;br/&gt;
How are file modifications treated? (appends, in place modifications?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect this table is also not up-to-date: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/apis/streaming/fault_tolerance.html#fault-tolerance-guarantees-of-data-sources-and-sinks&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/apis/streaming/fault_tolerance.html#fault-tolerance-guarantees-of-data-sources-and-sinks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;    The title says it all. &lt;br/&gt;
    It documents the continuous file processing semantics recently introduced in the Streaming API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    1) I will integrate that&lt;br/&gt;
    2) You are right. Files are read completely. The only problem is that upon recovery, the job will restart from the last checkpoint, i.e. the last before the source closes.&lt;br/&gt;
    3) when we process once, there is no explicit cancelation required. We decided to close the source explicitly, rather than wait for an external signal. This is also reasonable for resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
