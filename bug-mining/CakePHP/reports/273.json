Description\r\n\r\nWhen the response header from a Http/Client::get request is eventually parsed by Http/Cookie/Cookie::createFromHeaderString, the method can cause a warning saying \"undefined array key 1\" in some situations . This happens for example when the response header contains Set-Cookie with an empty value string.\r\n\r\nCode snippet to reproduce this:\r\n```php\r\n// NOTE: The url used is just an example url that contains to a src example, \r\n// the actual url contained privacy sensitive data and has been replaced\r\n// by an example src that leads to the same results as the real world data.\r\n\r\n$url = 'https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://www.google.com';\r\n$fakeUseragent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36';\r\n$client = new \\Cake\\Http\\Client([\r\n    'ssl_verify_peer' => false,\r\n    'ssl_verify_peer_name' => false,\r\n    'ssl_verify_host' => false,\r\n    'redirect' => 10,\r\n]);\r\n$response = $client->get(\r\n    $url,\r\n    [],\r\n    ['headers' => ['User-Agent' => $fakeUseragent]]\r\n);\r\n```\r\nIt can be prevented in this particular case by adding an additional check to the CookieCollection::createFromHeader method, that will skip any empty values. I am however unsure if this would solve the issue permanently since the problem actually exists in the Cookie::createFromHeaderString method.\r\n\r\n### CakePHP Version\r\n\r\n4.4.17\r\n\r\n### PHP Version\r\n\r\n8.2","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
