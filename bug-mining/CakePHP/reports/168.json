is a:\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.9.1 (but is also broken in older and newer versions)\r\n* Platform and Target: PHP 7.4.3, Ubuntu 20.04, libcurl 7.68.0\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nDo a `HEAD` request to a webservice that returns a `Content-Length > 0` but no body, in accordance with the [HTTP spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.4).\r\nFor example Elasticsearch, see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/21123 .\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nI get an error `cURL Error (18) transfer closed with 431 bytes remaining to read`.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nThe HTTP request succeeds\r\n\r\n### What is the fix?\r\nAdd a case [here](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/Http/Client/Adapter/Curl.php#L105):\r\n\r\n```php\r\n            case Request::METHOD_HEAD:\r\n                $out[CURLOPT_NOBODY] = true;\r\n                break;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have a webserver which sends a non-zero content length for HEAD requests, you can reproduce it using the curl CLI:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -H 'Connection: close' -X HEAD [url here]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that using `-I` instead of `X HEAD` does work, since that will set `CURLOPT_NOBODY` correctly.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
