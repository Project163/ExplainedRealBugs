In the `Query` class, there is a similar method `setSelectTypeMap()`. This method only takes a `TypeMap`, not an `array`. Can you add this feature? It would make code using this a tiny bit more readable.\r\n\r\nThat said, two quick questions: \r\n\r\n- I was wondering whether the use of the `TypeMapTrait` in `Query` was done correctly. Point is, that the setters there call `$this->_dirty()`. The setters from the `TypeMapTrait` don't do that though, which may or may not be a bug.\r\n- Why is there a separate `setTypeMap()` and `setSelectTypeMap()` in the `Query` class?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.4.7","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
