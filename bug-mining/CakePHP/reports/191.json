is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.2.2\r\n* Platform and Target: PHP 7.4.11\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\n```php\r\n    /**\r\n     * Test resetPassword method\r\n     *\r\n     * @return void\r\n     */\r\n    public function testResetPassword(): void\r\n    {\r\n        $this->enableCsrfToken();\r\n        $this->enableSecurityToken();\r\n\r\n        $this->enableRetainFlashMessages();\r\n        $this->post('/users/reset-password', ['reset_password_token' => 'validresettoken']);\r\n        $this->assertResponseSuccess();\r\n        $this->assertSession('The Password has been reset.', 'Flash.flash.0.message');\r\n        $this->assertRedirect(['controller' => 'Users', 'action' => 'login']);\r\n\r\n        $this->post('/users/reset-password', ['reset_password_token' => 'unknownresetpasswordtoken']);\r\n        $this->assertResponseSuccess();\r\n        $this->assertSession('The Password Reset Token is unknown.', 'Flash.flash.0.message');\r\n        $this->assertRedirect(['controller' => 'Users', 'action' => 'login']);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n### What happened\r\nThis test started to fail after updating to 4.2.2. Worked fine before.\r\n\r\nFailed asserting that 'The Password Reset Token is unknown.' is in session path 'Flash.flash.0.message'.\r\n\r\nusing $this->assertFlashMessage didn't work either.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nTest should still pass?\r\n\r\nIt still works when splitting the test into two test cases\r\n\r\n```php\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Test resetPassword method with valid token\r\n     *\r\n     * @return void\r\n     */\r\n    public function testResetPasswordValid(): void\r\n    {\r\n        $this->enableCsrfToken();\r\n        $this->enableSecurityToken();\r\n\r\n        $this->enableRetainFlashMessages();\r\n        $this->post('/users/reset-password', ['reset_password_token' => 'validresettoken']);\r\n        $this->assertResponseSuccess();\r\n        $this->assertFlashMessageAt(0, 'The Password has been reset.');\r\n        $this->assertRedirect(['controller' => 'Users', 'action' => 'login']);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Test resetPassword method with invalid token\r\n     *\r\n     * @return void\r\n     */\r\n    public function testResetPasswordInvalid(): void\r\n    {\r\n        $this->enableCsrfToken();\r\n        $this->enableSecurityToken();\r\n\r\n        $this->enableRetainFlashMessages();\r\n        $this->post('/users/reset-password', ['reset_password_token' => 'unknownresetpasswordtoken']);\r\n        $this->assertResponseSuccess();\r\n        $this->assertFlashMessageAt(0, 'The Password Reset Token is unknown.');\r\n        $this->assertRedirect(['controller' => 'Users', 'action' => 'login']);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15268/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15268/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
