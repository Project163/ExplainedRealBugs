is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.7.7\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\n\r\nI have  a modelless form with custom validation.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass RegisterForm extends Form\r\n{\r\n    public function validationDefault(Validator $validator)\r\n    {\r\n        $validator\r\n            ->email('email')\r\n            ->requirePresence('email', 'create')\r\n            ->allowEmptyString('email', false);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to overwrite error messages using form helper.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n $this->Form->control('email', [\r\n    'label' => false,\r\n    'placeholder' => __('E-mail address'),\r\n    'error' => [\r\n        'email' => __('Please provide a valid e-mail address.'),\r\n    ]\r\n]) \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nError messages set with a helper are not displayed.\r\n\r\n### How to fix it\r\n\r\n`FormContext` returns only array values in `errors()`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/cedcb681b3e383dfa272956b002a0448aa4443c6/src/View/Form/FormContext.php#L227-L230\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to fix by removing `array_values()` but is it BC safe enough? \r\n\r\nThis says the error array is expected to have error names:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/cedcb681b3e383dfa272956b002a0448aa4443c6/src/View/Helper/FormHelper.php#L790-L791","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
