For some reason the original request session was reset and only the flash messages persisted.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that, once again allowing assertions against the session *and* flash messages. It also contains some cleanup for unused variables to ensure `$_SESSION` (or the TestSession via `getSession()`) is used for future assertions.\r\n\r\nThis bug likely affects 5.x as well, but I only took a cursory look (all the apps I maintain are far behind). Let me know if you'd like me to open a PR for 5.x as well.\r\n\r\nQuestion: if merged, will this fix be backported to 4.2 when the bug was introduced?
