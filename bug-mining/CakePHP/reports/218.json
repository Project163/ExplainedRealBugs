Description\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\ni think there is an issue in BreadcrumbsHelper.\r\n\r\nI defined the following Breadcrumbs:\r\n```php\r\n$this->Breadcrumbs->add(\r\n    'Breadcrum I',\r\n    ['controller' => 'products', 'action' => 'index']\r\n);\r\n\r\n$this->Breadcrumbs->insertAfter(\r\n    'Breadcrum I', // the title of the crumb to insert after\r\n    'Breadcrum II',\r\n    ['controller' => 'products', 'action' => 'index']\r\n);\r\n```\r\nAfter i do this, Cakephp returns an Error:\r\n```\r\nNo crumb could be found at index '1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `findCrumb`-Method wich is called from `insertAfter` in `BreadcrumbsHelper.php` returns the Value 0.\r\nAfter check for null, insertAfter calls insertAt with $key+1:\r\n```php\r\nreturn $this->insertAt($key + 1, $title, $url, $options);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `insertAt`-Method is an isset-Check:\r\n```php\r\nif (!isset($this->crumbs[$index])) {\r\n    throw new LogicException(sprintf(\"No crumb could be found at index '%s'\", $index));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis Error is shown, when the key (in this Case \"1\") not exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n### CakePHP Version\r\n\r\n4.2.0\r\n\r\n### PHP Version\r\n\r\n7.4.19","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
