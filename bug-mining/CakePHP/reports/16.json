you did\r\nUpdated from 3.3.11 to 3.3.12. \r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nGot the following error on most pages:\r\n```\r\nFatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to protected method Aura\\Intl\\Translator::getMessage() from context 'Cake\\I18n\\Translator' in /var/www/site/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/I18n/Translator.php on line 97\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\n### Possible fix\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/I18n/Translator.php#L95 tries to execute protected method on fallback class. `getMessage` should either be replaced by `translate` or the fallback should be moved to the translate function, which is more neat I guess.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/10115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/10115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
