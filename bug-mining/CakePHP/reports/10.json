is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.3.9\r\n* Platform and Target: Vagrant bento/debian-8.6 with PHP7.0.13-1~dotdeb+8.1\r\n\r\n### What I did\r\nI created a new project, where I loaded a git submodule into the plugins in order to start updating my TableHelper plugin. The goal of this project was to setup a sandbox to develop plugins.\r\nI loaded the plugin and then added `$this->loadHelper('TableHelper.Table');` to the `initialize()` method of the default `AppView`.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nMy helper wasn't loaded with the following message on the screen:\r\n\r\n> An Internal Server Error Occurred\r\n\r\nI checked the error.log of Apache, tried to find an error log of PHP but nothing there. After a couple of hours debugging I found out that my php.ini didn't log php errors. So, changed that and went back into the code and tried to find the log file.\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nSo after a tip on Stackoverflow I kept adding `die()` methods in the core of CakePHP and after another couple of hours, I think I found out what is wrong.\r\n\r\n### What I think is wrong\r\n\r\nI believe the default `ExceptionRenderer` is using the `AppView` as viewClass, right? Now, when I load a helper that doesn't exist, it will try to render an exception. But, that exception renderer is creating a new instance of `AppView` and thus trying to load the non existing helper again, and again, and again...\r\n\r\nAt first I thought I was wrong, and I still don't believe it actually, but after some more debugging I think I confirmed this.\r\n\r\n### Howto reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a new project, make sure you see the default cake page.\r\n- Add `debug($className);` at https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/View/ViewBuilder.php#L362\r\n- Refresh the page, as expected you see `AppView` popup.\r\n- Add an Exception somewhere in `AppController::initialize()`.\r\n- Refresh the page, you'll see `AppView` two times, as expected\r\n\r\nThis confirms AppView is being used by the ExceptionRenderer.\r\n\r\n- Remove the Exception from the AppController\r\n- Add `$this->loadHelper('FooBar')` to `AppView::initialize()`.\r\n- Refresh, your page, now you'll see `AppView` three times and then `An Internal Server Error Occurred`\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nA 500 Exception with a 'Missing Helper' message of some sort.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nA dedicated 'ExceptionView' which makes sure no programmer input is messing up the view. If I want the ExceptionRenderer to use my own `AppView` I will have to opt-in, instead of opt-out.\r\n\r\n#### PS.\r\nThe error.log in the logs dir did log the missing Helper message, but I wasn't expecting this `internal server error` message and so I thought something else was wrong. Therefore I had to dig into it as I believed I was making a mistake.\r\n\r\nIt was also hard to debug as I tested it on another project (also Cake3) but that uses a custom viewClass (but not for the ExceptionRenderer). So when I loaded a non-existing helper there, it wasn't showing this error as the infinite loop wasn't present. Which caused even more of a headache as I wasn't expecting this simple bug.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/9830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/9830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
