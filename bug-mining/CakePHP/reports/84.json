is a:\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.6.7\r\n* Platform and Target: PHP 7.2.17, **PostgreSQL 10.7** (Ubuntu 10.7-0ubuntu0.18.10.1)\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nFixtures using `$import` on tables that contain a `char(36)` column are created incorrectly as a `char` (which results in `char(1)`).\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nInserting fixture data generates error:\r\n```\r\nERROR:  value too long for type character(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nI expected a char column with a size of 36 to be created.\r\n\r\nWe are using postgres UUID columns in the app and that works as expected, but we are using `char(36)` for another non-standard ID.\r\n\r\nFor now I'll just resize our columns to make it work.\r\n\r\nIt can be fixed by removing the second part of the conditional
