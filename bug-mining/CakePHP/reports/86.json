is a **bug**\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.7.7\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nIn an integration test,\r\n```\r\n$this->get([\r\n    'prefix' => 'v1',\r\n    'controller' => 'Events',\r\n    'action' => 'future',\r\n    '?' => ['apikey' => $this->getApiKey()],\r\n    '_host' => 'api.app.localhost',\r\n    '_ssl' => true\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n[The docs](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/development/routing.html#matching-specific-hostnames) suggest that using `_host` this way should work for URL generation, and I'm not aware of a reason why specifying `_host` for integration tests shouldn't work.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nI'm working to combine a website and its API into one codebase. It's currently set up to reject any requests for pages under the `v1` prefix if the `api.` subdomain is missing, so I'm updating the requests in API integration tests to have `api.` in their host names.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nA 404 response with this error message:\r\n> A route matching \"/https://api.app.localhost/v1/events/future\" could not be found.\r\n\r\n(Note the leading slash in the URL)\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expected the provided URL to be routed correctly and return a successful response. The array correctly resolves to `https://api.app.localhost/v1/events/future` when put through `Router::url()` and returns a normal, non-error response when loaded in a browser.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThe `MissingRouteException` exception is getting thrown in `RouteCollection::parseRequest()`, where `$request->url` is `https://api.app.localhost...`, but `$request->here` is `/https://api.app.localhost...` with a leading slash.\r\n\r\n`$request = new ServerRequest(['url' => $url]);` in `IntegrationTestTrait::_url($url)` is taking the correct URL and returning a `$request` with the incorrect `here` property.\r\n\r\nThis code in `ServerRequest::_setConfig()`\r\n```\r\nif (strlen($config['url'])) {\r\n    $uri = $uri->withPath('/' . $config['url']);\r\n}\r\n...\r\n$this->here = $this->base . '/' . $this->url;\r\n```\r\ncauses `$request->uri->path` and `$request->here` to be set with a leading slash.\r\n\r\nThen in the `foreach` loop in `RouteCollection::parseRequest`, each possible matching path (e.g. `\"/v1/events/future\"` is compared against the entire URL that's pulled from `$request->uri->path`, (e.g. `\"/https://api.app.localhost/v1/events/future\"`) and rejected if the request's path doesn't _begin_ with the candidate path, which `$request->uri->path` never will if a protocol and host are included.\r\n\r\nSo it's looking like the router can correctly translate the provided URL array into a string (actually, the same `MissingRouteException` is encountered if a URL string is provided), but can't then get the correct route back out of that string as long as the host name is manually specified.  **Is this a bug, or am I going about this wrong?**\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nI'm not sure what specifically to suggest for fixing it if it were a bug, but comparing `$paths` in `RouteCollection::parseRequest` to a normalized version of the current path, with `$uri->scheme . '://' . $uri->host` removed, instead of to (potentially) the full URL, might be a good direction to take.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
