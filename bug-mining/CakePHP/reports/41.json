E.g `http:://localhost/api/example.json`\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThe `$this->RequestHandler->isXml()` returns positive value.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that code here https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/Controller/Component/RequestHandlerComponent.php#L509 which tries to parse the `Accept` header and if it is empty it returns the `$this->_ext` regardless of whether the `$type` variable is set or not.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nIt should return `false` since the request wants JSON and not XML.\r\n\r\nAccording to function documentation if variable `$type` is set (which it is in `->isXML()` call), it should return boolean true/false.\r\n\r\nThe fix should be probably:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (empty($acceptRaw)) {\r\n    return $type ? $this->ext == $type : $this->ext;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould it be fixed in `RequestHandlerComponent` or is it expected behaviour and my understanding is worng?","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11761/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
