I thought it would be easier if I just wrote the changes in a PR together with the appropriate tests when I had the time. I had the time now, so I created a PR that can be reviewed. Let me know if there are any issues, or if this may break any existing stuff. Aside from adding new assertions, the only existing assertion that I did change was from:\r\n```\r\n$this->assertEquals('webcal://foo.com/posts/index', $result);\r\n```\r\nTo:\r\n```\r\n$this->assertEquals('webcal://foo.com:80/posts/index', $result);\r\n```\r\nSince `getservbyname` doesn't return a default port for `webcal`.
