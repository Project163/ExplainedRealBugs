This should not be a breaking change, since the date us already formatted again within the same line, but I am not sure if this could cause any new problem. \r\n\r\nThis is a quick test:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$time = new FrozenTime('2014-07-06T13:09:01.523000+00:00');\r\n$this->assertEquals('2014-07-06 13:09:01.523000', $time->format('Y-m-d H:i:s.u'));\r\n$i18nFormat = $time->i18nFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss.SSSxxx\", null, 'en-US');\r\n$this->assertEquals('2014-07-06T13:09:01.523+00:00', $i18nFormat); // this will fail returning 2014-07-06T13:09:01.000+00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is hapening in many different cakephp versions including 4.x and 5.x and it is independent from php version used\r\n\r\n\r\n### CakePHP Version\r\n\r\n4.4.0\r\n\r\n### PHP Version\r\n\r\n7.4","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17604/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
