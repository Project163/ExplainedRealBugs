Description\r\n\r\nI'm upgrading my application from Cake4 to Cake5 and noticed, that my tests fail if fixtures with different connection names are loaded (e.g. from a plugin).\r\nI tried to narrow down the problem and it seems, that the function `addTestAliases()` in file `src/TestSuite/ConnectionHelper.php` is causing the problem.\r\n\r\nMy Fixture class looks like this:\r\n```\r\nclass InvoicesFixture extends TestFixture\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * Test connection\r\n     *\r\n     * @var string\r\n     */\r\n    public string $connection = 'test_myapp';\r\n\r\n    public array $records = [\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aliases created by this function look like that:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  'debug_kit' => 'test_debug_kit',\r\n  'default' => 'test',\r\n  'test_myapp' => 'myapp', // this is wrong\r\n  'myapp' => 'test_myapp',\r\n  'test_debug_kit' => 'debug_kit'\r\n]\r\n```\r\nThe code in ConnectionHelper.php\r\n```\r\npublic function addTestAliases(): void\r\n{\r\n[...]\r\nelse {\r\n    $test = 'test_' . $connection;\r\n    ConnectionManager::alias($connection, $test);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nshould be in my opinion\r\n```\r\npublic function addTestAliases(): void\r\n{\r\n[...]\r\nelse {\r\n    $test = 'test_' . $connection;\r\n    ConnectionManager::alias($test, $connection);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCurrently running the tests truncates my development tables 😕 and tests fail because the data is inserted into the wrong database.\r\n\r\n### CakePHP Version\r\n\r\n5.0.6\r\n\r\n### PHP Version\r\n\r\n8.2","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
