right @markstory , that's what the comment of `FormHelper::checkbox()` says:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* - `hiddenField` - boolean to indicate if you want the results of checkbox() to include\r\n*    a hidden input with a value of ''.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the comment is wrong in terms of the mentioned value, which in fact is `0` instead of `''`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, based on the actual code of `FormHelper::checkbox()`, it's absolutely possible to set a desired string value for the `hiddenField`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$output = '';\r\nif ($options['hiddenField']) {\r\n    $hiddenOptions = [\r\n        'name' => $options['name'],\r\n        'value' =>\r\n            $options['hiddenField'] !== true && $options['hiddenField'] !== '_split'\r\n                ? $options['hiddenField'] // <-------------------- see here\r\n                : '0',\r\n        'form' => $options['form'] ?? null,\r\n        'secure' => false,\r\n    ];\r\n    if (isset($options['disabled']) && $options['disabled']) {\r\n        $hiddenOptions['disabled'] = 'disabled';\r\n    }\r\n    $output = $this->hidden($fieldName, $hiddenOptions);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I **can** create a checkbox with values of `yes` (active) and `no` (inactive), but i **cannot** create one with `1` and `''` which is what I actually want to achieve.\r\n\r\nI don't see a reason why this use case shouldn't be possible, hence I would argue that the documentation of `hiddenField` should be updated and state that it can either be a boolean or a string (which is in fact already the case!) and the method itself should then also support empty strings by applying the minor change suggested in my initial post.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/1020436817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gerhard-lechner","id":270320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/270320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner","html_url":"https://github.com/gerhard-lechner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerhard-lechner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5944805390,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAoEbs5CTv4gzwAAAAFiVogO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/5944805390","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-24T18:59:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5944805398,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAoEbs5CTv4gzwAAAAFiVogW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/5944805398","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-24T18:59:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5946672343,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAAoEbs5CTv4gzwAAAAFicwTX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/5946672343","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-25T02:10:37Z","label":{"name":"defect","color":"f7c6c7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5946672346,
