is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [ ] bug\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.6\r\n* Platform and Target: N/A\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nIt is useful sometimes to specify cli options as required, but at the moment we cant. \r\n\r\nThis is most relevant If a cli has multiple required inputs - in this case it is currently only possible to enforce via the command parser by using (positional) arguments. \r\n\r\nExample, consider a shell with this options parser:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public function getOptionParser()\r\n    {\r\n        $parser = parent::getOptionParser();\r\n\r\n        foreach(range(1,3) as $i) {\r\n            $parser->addArgument(\"thing$i\", [\r\n                'help' => \"Required thing $i\",\r\n                'required' => true\r\n            ]);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return $parser;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n-> bin/cake my-cli --help\r\nUsage:\r\ncake my_cli [-h] [-q] [-v] <thing1> <thing2> <thing3>\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\n--help, -h     Display this help.\r\n--quiet, -q    Enable quiet output.\r\n--verbose, -v  Enable verbose output.\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n\r\nthing1  Required thing 1\r\nthing2  Required thing 2\r\nthing3  Required thing 3\r\n\r\n-> bin/cake my-cli\r\nError: Missing required arguments. thing1 is required.\r\n```\r\nAlthough helpful, having to specify args in order is sometimes pretty awkward.\r\n\r\nIt's be much easier with this example to create a parser like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public function getOptionParser()\r\n    {\r\n        $parser = parent::getOptionParser();\r\n\r\n        foreach(range(1,10) as $i) {\r\n            $parser->addOption(\"thing$i\", [ <---- changed\r\n                'help' => \"Required thing $i\",\r\n                'required' => true <---- ignored \r\n            ]);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return $parser;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that only achieves the syntax I'm looking for:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-> cake/bin/cake my-cli --help\r\nUsage:\r\ncake my_cli [-h] [-q] [-v] [--thing1] [--thing2] [--thing3]\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\n--help, -h     Display this help.\r\n--quiet, -q    Enable quiet output.\r\n--verbose, -v  Enable verbose output.\r\n--thing1       Required thing 1\r\n--thing2       Required thing 2\r\n--thing3       Required thing 3\r\n```\r\nIt does not enforce `required` as options are, according to the Shell class, always optional:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-> cake/bin/cake my-cli\r\nHello now going to try and do something in the main method and fail because required things are missing...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the ask here is simply to allow marking options required.","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12498/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
