did\r\nOn updating from 4.1.1 to 4.1.2, a number of plugins which were previously loading have become unusable.\r\nThe repo is: https://github.com/LBDistrictScouts/DistrictLeaders\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThe plugins from UseMuffin (Muffin/Trash & Muffin/Footprint) as well as Flash.Flash became unloadable. I have resolved Flash.Flash, by resolving references to it back to cake core flash.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI need a way to update without breaking my plugins. Is there an alias or something I can use? It appears to be the slash in the plugin name that is breaking the tests, but I can't locate the file or line in the 4.1.1 --> 4.1.2 diff that is causing
