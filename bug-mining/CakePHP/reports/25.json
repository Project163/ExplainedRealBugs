is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [ ] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [x] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.5-RC2\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nInitially when cakephp 3.x branch was started we had discussion and agreed to use interfaces over classes in case we have alternative to use interfaces.\r\nE.g. we used EntityInterface instead of Entity class to provide way to create app level Entity classes implementing same interface with additional functionallity.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nBut in 3.5 branch i see this commit 68d2fcb83fbd1612f10c00b2ba14e44c8cfeeafb (Fix some errors reported by phpstan level 2.) that revert some methods declaration to use Entity instead of interface and some other interfaces replaced with classes too.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI need confirmation everyone fine to revert to interfaces back.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11051/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11051/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
