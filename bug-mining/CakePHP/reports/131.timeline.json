Using `withType()` works because it overwrites the default content type property with the new value passed in, so when `withStatus()` is called it simply overwrites the value with the same value you specified in `withType()`. Not sure it is a bug since there seems to be some white-listing (though it is hard-coded and not able to be modified). Could potentially check if there is an existing 'Content-Type' header but that would require parsing the value out (there could be a character set or potentially other value included). I think `withType()` is really the best route to isolate the type from the actual header value. There is also already a [section dealing with content types in Request/Response objects](https://book.cakephp.org/3/en/controllers/request-response.html#dealing-with-content-types) in the cookbook.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/578463360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jimbo2150","id":25777094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc3MDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25777094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150","html_url":"https://github.com/jimbo2150","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimbo2150/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2979667614,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI5Nzk2Njc2MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/2979667614","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-26T02:55:59Z","label":{"name":"defect","color":"f7c6c7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2979667615,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI5Nzk2Njc2MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/2979667615","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-26T02:55:59Z","label":{"name":"http","color":"ffffff"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2979667620,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDI5Nzk2Njc2MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/2979667620","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-26T02:56:02Z","milestone":{"title":"4.0.4"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url"

This change should be backported to 3.x as well to resolve the same problem there.\r\n\r\nFixes #14211","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/578511670","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14211#issuecomment-578511670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14211","id":578511670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODUxMTY3MA==","user":{"login":"burzum","id":162789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjc4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum","html_url":"https://github.com/burzum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burzum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-26T15:16:43Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T15:16:43Z","body":"@markstory 4.0.4?
