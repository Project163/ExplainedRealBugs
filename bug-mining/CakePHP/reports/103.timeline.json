At least in Japan, any people wouldn't expect that `alphaNumeric()` returns true against our word characters such as hiragana (e.g. `にほんご`), katakana (e.g. `ニホンゴ`), and kanji (e.g. `日本語`). And they would use custom validation rules such as isHIragana, isKatakana, and isKanji. I don't think it should be the part of the core library though.\r\n\r\nAs another option, we could use the `[[:alnum:]]` pre-defined character class of PCRE instead. By default, the `u` modifier should not be used, and it can be used optionally. Though `/[[:alnum:]]/u` also returns `1` against `日本語`, I don't mind it as long as it is not a default behavior.\r\n\r\n@ADmad or @saeideng might have another opinion though. I think they are using yet another word characters in their language. Also umlaut characters in German should be considered.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/505915899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chinpei215","id":7399393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTkzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7399393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215","html_url":"https://github.com/chinpei215","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2441223861,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ0MTIyMzg2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/2441223861","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-26T15:04:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2441223862,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NDEyMjM4NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/2441223862","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-26T15:04:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2441223871,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ0MTIyMzg3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/2441223871","actor":{"login":"saeideng","id":8215801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTU4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8215801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng","html_url":"https://github.com/saeideng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeideng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-26T15:04:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2441223878,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NDEyMjM4Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/2441223878","actor":{"login":"sae
