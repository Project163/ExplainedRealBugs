Cake doesn't provide a transaction handle and there is no \"is transaction still good\" API for connections.\n\nAlso, what if `save()` was originally called after a transaction was started. Even if `save()` returns `false` this does not indicate that the transaction was rollback silently by a listener elsewhere. The caller is going to have the same problem that save is having now.\n\n@ADmad I'm a little confused by this issue. If a `afterSave()` executed invalid SQL that would have produced a PDO exception from the driver. Even if it was a constraint violation. So how was the listener able to rollback the transaction but also silence any SQL errors?\n\nCan we see a coding example?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/231355172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thinkingmedia","id":551022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTAyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/551022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia","html_url":"https://github.com/thinkingmedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":716984230,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzE2OTg0MjMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/716984230","actor":{"login":"lorenzo","id":37621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-07-08T13:10:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":716984231,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDcxNjk4NDIzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/716984231","actor":{"login":"lorenzo","id":37621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-07-08T13:10:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":716984232,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzE2OTg0MjMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/716984232","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-07-08T13:10:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":716984233,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDcxNjk4NDIzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/716984233","actor":{"logi

that's not the same thing. Associated data is saved as part of the `save()` process, and I think that process is working fine. `afterSave` is an event after that process has finished. If the developer is doing something at that stage and needs to abort the `save()` operation, then the code should throw an exception.\n\nIf a developer needs to stop a `save()` because of validations / rules executed in a listener. The developer should be using the `beforeSave` event. Which allows you to stop the save operation.\n\nKeep in mind, that the `afterSave` event is broadcasted to all listeners. If one listener rolls back changes and invalidates the save operation, then this will produce bugs in the other listeners that were executed first, because those listeners assumed the save operation was successful and that's why they are responsing to the `afterSave` event\n\nAs far as `save()` is concerned when it broadcasts `afterSave` it's responsibilities are done. That is the purpose of that event.\n\nI'm still confused on how a listener can roll back a transaction that it did not start. Each `save()` call uses `transactional` which would create a nested transaction. \n\nIf the developer needs to execute business logic (validation or rules) on multiple tables. They should be saving each entity individually inside a `transactional` and manage that process themselves. \n\nAgain, I think we need to see code that demonstrates the issue as we're now getting into a debate about the problem, and there is nothing productive about that.\n\nCan anyone write a quick unit test that reproduces the issue? Even just a quick hack as an example, it doesn't have to actually work.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/231365661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thinkingmedia","id":551022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTAyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/551022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia","html_url":"https://github.com/thinkingmedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/231386292","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/9079#issuecomment-231386292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/9079","id":231386292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTM4NjI5Mg==","user":{"login":"lorenzo","id":37621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T15:12:39Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T15:12:39Z","body":"> Again, I think we need to see code that demonstrates the issue as we're now getting into a debate about the problem, and there is nothing productive about that.\n\nhere it is:\n\n``` php\nfunction afterSave(...)\n{\n   $anyTable->save($invalidEntity); // This starts a transaction and executes rollback on failure\n   ...\n}\n```\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/231386292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lorenzo","id":37621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
