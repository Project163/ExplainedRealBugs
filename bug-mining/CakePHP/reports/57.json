Declare `AppExceptionRenderer`.\r\n```php\r\nnamespace App\\Error;\r\n\r\nuse Cake\\Error\\ExceptionRenderer;\r\n\r\nclass AppExceptionRenderer extends ExceptionRenderer\r\n{\r\n    public function missingController($error) {\r\n        die;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Configure `app.php` to use `AppExceptionRenderer` and set debug mode to false.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// In app.php\r\n'debug' => false,\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\n'Error' => [\r\n    'exceptionRenderer' => 'App\\Error\\AppExceptionRenderer'\r\n    // ...\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Access some non-existent page.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/some/non-existent/page\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nThe `AppExceptionRenderer::missingController()` method was not called.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nThe `AppExceptionRenderer::missingController()` method should be called. In CakePHP 2, custom error rendering methods are called regardless of debug mode.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason why debug mode is checked [here](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/18e5d31a8a5bd6f875790a930e3ff6d2be106f93/src/Error/ExceptionRenderer.php#L161-L166)?\r\n\r\n(Reported by **kino** in #japanese channel on Slack)","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/9905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/9905/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
