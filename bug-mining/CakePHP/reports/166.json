is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.1.0\r\n* Platform and Target: any\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\n\r\nI want to override my controller default model, defining it property `modelClass`:\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function initialize(): void\r\n{\r\n    parent::initialize();\r\n\r\n    $this->modelClass = MyPostsTable::class;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nController failed to recognize my custom table because its only parse dot notation.\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function __get(string $name)\r\n{\r\n    if (!empty($this->modelClass)) {\r\n        [$plugin, $class] = pluginSplit($this->modelClass, true);\r\n        if ($class === $name) {\r\n            return $this->loadModel((string)$plugin . $class);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I pass `$this->loadModel(MyPosts::class)` at my controller initialize, everything works (ModelAwareTrait can parse both formats)\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nUsing FQCN as a `$modelClass` should work - its easier to lint/check/refactor code with class names than strings.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
