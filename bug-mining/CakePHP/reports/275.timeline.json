don't think there was a regression with `DashedRoute`, but that the behavior has always been broken. The following tests fails in `4.x` as well:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n        $routes = new RouteCollection();\r\n        $builder = new RouteBuilder($routes, '/');\r\n        $builder->setRouteClass(DashedRoute::class);\r\n        $builder->connect('/tags/edit', ['controller' => 'Tags', 'action' => 'edit'], ['_name' => 'tags:edit']);\r\n        // Without this line the test passes.\r\n        $routes->match(['_name' => 'tags:edit'], []);\r\n\r\n        $route = $routes->routes()[0];\r\n        $this->assertSame('Tags', $route->defaults['controller']);\r\n        $this->assertSame('edit', $route->defaults['action']);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMutating the `defaults` based on whether or not the route has has match() called on it seems like the problematic behavior. I think ADmad's pull request is going in the right direction but we can't require developers to update their patterns, as the BC break could be large and would be hard to track down.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/1732850366/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/1733522387","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17265#issuecomment-1733522387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17265","id":1733522387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAoEbs5nU3PT","user":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-25T11:59:02Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T11:59:02Z","body":"We
