Description\r\n\r\nWhen using the new Fixture System and relying on `TestFixture::_schemaFromReflection` instead of specifying fields in the Fixture file CakePHP is not taking `_initializeSchema` of the table into consideration.\r\n\r\nHaving 2 json columns in a sqlite database result in errors inserting the fixture data now.\r\n\r\nWithin the Migration:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n
