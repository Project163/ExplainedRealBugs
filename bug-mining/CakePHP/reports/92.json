is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.7.7\r\n* Platform and Target: ubuntu, php7.2-fpm, nginx, mariadb\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nSaving some custom features into a JSON field `options` i want to add rules into some of theses options\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param Validator $validator\r\n     *\r\n     * @return Validator\r\n     */\r\n    public function validationMenuSubPages(Validator $validator)\r\n    {\r\n        $validator = $this->validationDefault($validator);\r\n\r\n        $subpages = new Validator();\r\n        $subpages\r\n                ->requirePresence('subpages', true)\r\n                ->allowEmptyString('subpages', false);\r\n\r\n        $validator\r\n

is my form\r\n\r\n    <?= $this->Form->control('options.subpages', [\r\n        'label' => __d(\"content_builder\", \"Pages à afficher\"),\r\n        'type' => 'select',\r\n        'multiple' => true,\r\n        'options' => $entity->get('subpages')\r\n    ]) ?>\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nSubmitting the form without data, the validation work, but is not cathed by FormHelper to be reinjected into my form view...\r\n\r\n    +\"[errors]\": array:1 [▼\r\n        \"options\" => array:1 [▼\r\n            \"subpages\" => array:1 [▼\r\n                \"_empty\" => \"This field cannot be left empty\"\r\n            ]\r\n        ]\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nSeems related to #11206 \r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nThe validation error should be related to the view form and not out of context, here i need to manually bind theses validation (requierements / errors) into my form, breaking the need of using
