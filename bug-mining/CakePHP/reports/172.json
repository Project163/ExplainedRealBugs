$this->Html->tableCells(\r\n    [\r\n        ['Foo', 'Bar'],\r\n        ['Yve', 'Ice'],\r\n        [42, 1.2345],\r\n    ]\r\n);`\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nTypeError Exception in HtmlHelper::tableCell(), because this function aspects the argument strictly to be of type string\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nHtmlHelper::_renderCells() should convert arguments of type int, float, bool to string before passing it to HtmlHelper::tableCell() as $cell. \r\nSo we can use mixed arrays.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14921/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14921/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
