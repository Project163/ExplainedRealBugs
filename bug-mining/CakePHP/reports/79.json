[x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.7.6\r\n* Platform and Target: nginx, php7.2, mariadb 10.3\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nWorking with some custom helpers getting the name of the controller who use the helper dosn't work anymore...\r\n\r\nBefore : cakephp 3.6.x\r\n`$this->getView()->name`\r\nReturn : Administartors (Show screenshot)\r\n![www trombert test box manager login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1088341/56041529-409c1280-5d39-11e9-9ce1-b20e61c5eae6.png)\r\n\r\nNow : cakephp 3.7.x\r\n`$this->getView()->getName()`\r\nResult : Call to undefined method CakeboxManager\\View\\CakeboxManagerView::getName()\r\n\r\n`$this->getView()->get('name')`\r\nResult : null\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nView.php\r\n```\r\n    public function __get($name) {\r\n        if (isset($this->_helperMap[$name]) && !isset($this->{$name})) {\r\n            $config = ['enabled' => false] + (array)$this->_helperMap[$name]['config'];\r\n            $this->{$name} = $this->_View->loadHelper($this->_helperMap[$name]['class'], $config);\r\n            return $this->{$name};\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere $name value = Url but it should be related to my Helper context attribute requested so $name = name = (Administrators)\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\n`$this->getView()->getName()` should return the protected attribute name value like `$this->getView()->getPlugin() `return the protected plugin value.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
