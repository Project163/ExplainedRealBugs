Description\n\nCurrently behavior methods like `SomeBehavior::foo()` can be directly accessed through the table instance, the behavior is attached to, as `$table->foo()`. While this was a good convenience to have back in the day, it's effectively been made redundant since the availability of traits in PHP.\n \nThe feature cause various problems:\n\n- It adds unnecessary code and checks to proxy the call to the behavior instance when the method is called on the table instance.\n- It hinders static analysis as the tools are unaware of this \"magic\" and requires either stubs or custom plugins to avoid \"method doesn't exist\" errors by the tools.\n- It causes issue when trying to reflect a method argument as highlighted [here](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18273#issuecomment-2776580715)\n- Another issue reported below is comments is using `LocatorAwareTrait` in two behaviors and load them in the same table triggers a LogicException due to the duplicate methods check in the behavior registry.\n\nSo I propose dropping this feature and instead users can use traits.\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n6.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18288/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
