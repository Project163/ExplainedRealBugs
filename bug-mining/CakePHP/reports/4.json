Links of format X will be converted to Y:\nX -> Https://www.google.com\nY -> <a href=\"Https://www.google.com\">Https://www.google.com</a>\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInstead, this happened:\n\nX -> Https://www.google.com\nY -> <a href=\"http://Https://www.google.com\">Https://www.google.com</a>\n### Suggested Fix:\n\nThis issue is happening here:\nTextHelper Line number: 151\nThe regex here is checking for all protocols before the colon, however is only matching lowercase characters. If we match uppercase letters as well, this issue will be resolved:\n`if (!preg_match('#^[a-z]+\\://#', $url)) {` \n`if (!preg_match('#^[A-Za-z]+\\://#', $url)) {`\n\nP.S.
