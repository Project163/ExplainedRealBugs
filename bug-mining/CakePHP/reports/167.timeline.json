did\r\nI have a form in with a hidden boolean field which value is false.\r\nWith #14548 a value of false is stored (correctly) as '0', but for the SecurityComponent FormHelper#hidden returns the value as\r\n  (string)$option['val']\r\nsee FormHelper line 1635\r\nSo the SsecurityComponent expects the value to be an empty string \"\", but in POST it is \"0\", which causes validatePost to fail\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nSee above, POST data fails to validate\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nPOST validates, of course :)\r\nMy guess is that the security is called before
