} event.returnValue = false; return false;\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nThe core contains\r\n```php\r\n$message = $this->_cleanConfirmMessage($message);\r\n$confirm = \"if (confirm({$message})) { {$okCode} } {$cancelCode}\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the confirm part would just become a re-usable `data-confirm=\"Are you sure you want to delete # \\u00d6sterreich?\"` attribute on the link element and the JS code then would be simpler and directly just used this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (confirm(document.{...}.dataset.confirm) ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the following code would work:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('table.list a.postLink').removeAttr('onclick').click(function(e) {\r\n            e.preventDefault();\r\n\r\n            var alert = $(this).data('confirm');\r\n            if (!confirm(alert)) {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n            var form = $(this).prev();\r\n            var url = $(form).attr(\"action\");\r\n            var tr = $(this).closest('tr');\r\n            url = url + '.json';\r\n            $.post(url).success(function(res) {\r\n                if (res.error) {\r\n                    alert(res.error);\r\n                    return false;\r\n                }\r\n                tr.fadeOut(200);\r\n            }).error(function() {\r\n                alert(\"Error\");\r\n            });\r\n            return false;\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, I would have to duplicate this in the Form->postLink() call as separate data attribute for it.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think?","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13424/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
