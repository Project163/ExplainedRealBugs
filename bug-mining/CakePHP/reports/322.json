Description\n\nWe are in transition to upgrade our codebase to CakePHP v5 and after upgrading we are getting below error:\n\n```\nTypeError: str_contains(): Argument #1 ($haystack) must be of type

investigation I stumble upon the [Move Uri and base marshalling from ServerRequestFactory to UriFactory](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/pull/17027) PR. After carefully looking at the changes it seems before the method was merging the `$_SERVER` with the actual `$server` and then normalizing it.\n```php\n$server += $_SERVER;\n$server = normalizeServer($server);\n```\nBut this is not done in the refactored code (`UriFactory::marshalUriAndBaseFromSapi()`). When I put these two lines inside the method the tests starts passing and it seems to be working fine. So what I'm not sure is if this is intentional or if this is missed and needs to be added. There's nothing documented in the migration guide too related to this change if intentional.\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n5.0.11\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.2.22","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
