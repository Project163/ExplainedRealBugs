I get redirected to `http://localhost:8080/products/test/xx%2Fyy`\r\n2. The var dump shows:\r\n```\r\n/var/www/src/Controller/ProductsController.php:54:\r\narray (size=2)\r\n  0 => string 'xx' (length=2)\r\n  1 => string 'yy' (length=2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n1. To get redirected to `http://localhost:8080/products/test/xx%2Fyy`\r\n2. The var dump to show:\r\n```\r\n/var/www/src/Controller/ProductsController.php:54:\r\narray (size=1)\r\n  0 => string 'xx/yy' (length=5)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is causing this\r\nIn https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/d5283af818b59c5d96355d6e42bbd77e1322d8cb `urldecode` got added. Which is still present in [4.2.1](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/4.2.1/src/Routing/Route/Route.php#L453).\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif (!preg_match($compiledRoute, urldecode($url), $route)) {\r\n    return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis line of code decodes the entire URL before routing the request. Causing this bug. Changing it to `if(!preg_match($compiledRoute, $url, $route))` fixed the problem.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that all the params are indvidually encoded on [Route.php#L794](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/4.2.1/src/Routing/Route/Route.php#L794) and decoded on [Route.php#L575](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/4.2.1/src/Routing/Route/Route.php#L575)\r\n\r\nSo we are now encoding once, and decoding twice, which doesn't make any sense to me.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\n\r\nI fully understand why this is happening, because of international URI (IRI) which might contain characters like `آموزش` and I respect that. But I think we should think of another solution, because very basic functionality and expected behavior is now broken.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15269/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
