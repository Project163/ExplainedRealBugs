the query used would have the target table as the root table, and *join* the junction table. This would cause the junction table entities to use the target table entity class.\r\n\r\nNow the junction table is used as the root and the association target is joined on. I've also removed the column subsetting so that entities passed to callbacks include their complete property sets.\r\n\r\nTargeting this for 4.3 as the change in behavior while more correct could
