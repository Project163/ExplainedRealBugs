Description\n\nWhile working on a simple REST example, following https://book.cakephp.org/5/en/development/rest.html#rest to generate json serialized output\r\n\r\nUsing this code\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?php\r\ndeclare(strict_types=1);\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Controller;\r\n\r\nuse Cake\\View\\JsonView;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Users Controller\r\n *\r\n * @property \\App\\Model\\Table\\UsersTable $Users\r\n */\r\nclass UsersController extends AppController\r\n{\r\n    public function viewClasses(): array\r\n    {\r\n        return [JsonView::class];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Index method\r\n     *\r\n     * @return \\Cake\\Http\\Response|null|void Renders view\r\n     */\r\n    public function index()\r\n    {\r\n        $query = $this->Users->find();\r\n        $users = $this->paginate($query);\r\n\r\n        $this->set(compact('users'));\r\n        $this->viewBuilder()->setOption('serialize', ['users']);\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8765/users/index\r\n{\r\n    \"users\": {}\r\n}% \r\n```\r\n\r\nNo data is serialized.\r\n\r\nThe same example, with the same database is producing the expected serialized data for the users records.\r\n\r\nWhen tracing the data in JsonView class I see\r\n\r\nvendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/View/JsonView.php:150 $data contents are a Cake\\Datasource\\Paging\\PaginatedResultSet with non empty items.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8765/users/index\r\n{\r\n    \"users\": {...serialized data for users in database...}\r\n}% \r\n```\r\n\r\nI've used CakePHP 5.0.0 but also checked the latest 5.x e227a2a95d291c393980b3be51957fb6b5d368db commit just in case it was already fixed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n5.0.0\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.2.9","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
