With this approach the behavior is opt-in, and maintains the declarative nature of most application implementations.\r\n\r\nThe new class could be `Cake\\View\\NegotiationRequiredView` . This class would:\r\n\r\n* Set the status code to 406\r\n* Remove the body of the response.\r\n* Retain all other headers currently set.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this the `NegotitationRequiredView` would have a `contentType()` of `'*'`. This would require a special case in Controller logic, but I think the special case in framework code is worth the improved developer experience.\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.4","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
