for the test case @swiffer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is caused by `BufferedStatement::rowCount()` which fetches records as associative arrays \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/818eddcd6b96060b64447fab667de26b126fc3ee/src/Database/Statement/BufferedStatement.php#L258-L265\r\n\r\nIt manifests only with logging enabled because `LoggingStatement::execute()` calls `rowCount()`\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/818eddcd6b96060b64447fab667de26b126fc3ee/src/Database/Log/LoggingStatement.php#L67\r\n\r\nSo essentially when used buffered statement calling `rowCount()` before doing a fetch has the potential to cause unexpected results as it fetches the rows before a `fetchAll()` call is explicitly made.\r\n\r\nThe fix would be to change `LoggingStatement` to not call `rowCount()`.\r\n\r\nThis issue mostly likely exists in 4.0 and probably even 3.x too.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/640113484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3415257159,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQxNTI1NzE1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/3415257159","actor":{"login":"swiffer","id":2990373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTAzNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2990373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer","html_url":"https://github.com/swiffer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-06T20:21:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3415257161,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0MTUyNTcxNjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/3415257161","actor":{"login":"swiffer","id":2990373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTAzNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2990373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer","html_url":"https://github.com/swiffer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-06T20:21:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3415257329,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0MTUyNTczMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/3415257329","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-06T20:21:56Z","label":{"name":"defect","color":"f7c6c7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3415257444,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzQxNTI1NzQ0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/3415257444","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6
