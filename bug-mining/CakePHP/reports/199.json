is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.2\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/app/issues/833\r\n\r\nAccess `PagesController::display()` from default app skeleton using URL `/pages/`.\r\n\r\n ```\r\npublic function display(string ...$path): ?Response\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nIn CakePHP 4.2, action is called with one argument `null`, which triggers `[TypeError] Argument 1 passed to App\\Controller\\PagesController::display() must be of the type string, null given`.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nAction should receive no arguments like in CakePHP 4.1.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/pull/15241 fixed similar problem, but this issue still exists.
