Ran command `bin/cake i18n extract` with the CakePHP 4.0.0-beta3 version\r\n2. Pressed enter repeatedly to use all default values with no options set, as to extract the translation strings inside the project and Cake Core from the default extraction paths.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThe default extraction path takes translations strings from the `src/` path. Translation strings inside controllers, helpers, models etc. are extracted. No translation strings inside templates were extracted.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nWith the new path for templates, the current default extraction path does not extract translation strings from the templates folder, as that reside outside the `src/` folder. It resides in the root folder.\r\n\r\n### What I think needs to be done\r\nAdd `templates/` to the default extraction path. \r\n* `/src`\r\n* `/templates`","closed_by":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13623/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
