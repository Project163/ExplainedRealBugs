For this to work, we dynamically set the `duration` of the engine to the value of the TTL and set it back to the normal `duration` again after writing the cache key.\r\n\r\nThe useful part of our code:\r\n```php\r\nclass CacheEngineWrapper implements CacheInterface\r\n{\r\n    protected $engine;\r\n\r\n    public function __construct(CacheEngine $cacheEngine)\r\n    {\r\n        $this->engine = $cacheEngine;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected function setTtl($ttl = null)\r\n    {\r\n        $defaultDuration = $this->engine->getConfig('duration');\r\n        if ($ttl !== null) {\r\n            if ($ttl instanceof \\DateInterval) {\r\n                $ttlTime = new \\DateTime();\r\n                $ttlTime = $ttlTime->add($ttl);\r\n                $this->engine->setConfig('duration', $ttlTime->getTimestamp() - time());\r\n            } else {\r\n                $this->engine->setConfig('duration', $ttl);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return $defaultDuration;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function get($key, $default = null)\r\n    {\r\n        $value = $this->engine->read($key);\r\n        return $value === false ? $default : $value;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function set($key, $value, $ttl = null)\r\n    {\r\n        $defaultDuration = $this->setTtl($ttl);\r\n        $success         = $this->engine->write($key, $value);\r\n        $this->setTtl($defaultDuration);\r\n        return $success;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThis works for all `CacheEngine` implementations except for the `FileEngine` in a specific case: if the TTL of an item we want to save is more than the default `duration`, the data *does* get saved in the cached but never gets retrieved, because of the second clause in this `if`: https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/Cache/Engine/FileEngine.php#L197\r\n\r\nAll other cache engines to not check the `duration` when reading an item; only `FileEngine` does. Maybe I am missing some (edge) case, but I think the second part of this `if` statement can be removed.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expected my cached item to be returned when I retrieve it.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
