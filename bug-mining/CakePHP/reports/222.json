Description\n\nNumberHelper and Number Utility Class will fail to multiply string values on PHP8 (not PHP7.4).\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nDatabase fields for decimal type are set as string on the entity (e.g. MySQL field `factor` of Type `decimal(4,3)` will have a Entity (vatrate) field like `'factor' => '0.190'`.\r\n\r\nWhen using the NumberHelper `$this->Number->toPercentage($vatrate->factor)` will output the correct Percentage `0,19 %`.\r\nWhen adding the multiply Option this will result in an error: `$this->Number->toPercentage($vatrate->factor, 2, ['multiply' => true])`\r\n\r\n`NumberFormatter::format(): Argument #1 ($num) must be of type int|float, string given`\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions:\r\n\r\n- cast to float when using the Helper: `$this->Number->toPercentage(floatval($vatrate->factor), 2, ['multiply' => true])` and update the docs\r\n\r\n- cast to float in [Number](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/4.x/src/I18n/Number.php#L147) before passing to passing to `precision()` like:\r\n```\r\n    public static function toPercentage($value, int $precision = 2, array $options = []): string\r\n    {\r\n        $options += ['multiply' => false, 'type' => NumberFormatter::PERCENT];\r\n        $value = (float)$value;\r\n        if (!$options['multiply']) {\r\n            $value = $value / 100;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return static::precision($value, $precision, $options);\r\n    }\r\n```\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.3.0\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.0","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
