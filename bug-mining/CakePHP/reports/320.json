This can be problematic in containerized environments (like Docker) or when specific key locations are required for security or organizational reasons. It lacks the flexibility to directly specify the paths to the SSL certificate, key, and CA certificate files within the database configuration.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\nIntroduce new configuration options within the database connection settings to explicitly define the paths to the SSL certificate, key, and CA certificate files. This would provide greater control and flexibility over SSL/TLS connections.\n\n**Example Configuration (in `app.php` or `app_local.php`):**\n\n```php\n'Datasources' => [\n    'default' => [\n        'host' => 'your_db_host',\n        'username' => 'your_db_user',\n        'password' => 'your_db_password',\n        'database' => 'your_db_name',\n        'ssl_key' => '/path/to/your/client-key.pem',\n        'ssl_cert' => '/path/to/your/client-cert.pem',\n        'ssl_ca' => '/path/to/your/ca-cert.pem',\n        'ssl' => true, // Or false, as needed\n        'ssl_mode' => 'prefer', // Or false, as needed\n        // ... other existing options\n    ],\n],\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n5.0","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
