After implementing this feature, I noticed another issue. Even if I registered a custom http code into the `Response` class via the `httpCodes()` method, they were not available in the `ExceptionRenderer`, because after an exception was thrown, the `ExceptionRenderer` would instantiate a different `Response` object [here](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/2224d73f86ff6a13e7bb276791a1651089d60170/src/Error/ExceptionRenderer.php#L120).\nSince `ErrorController` is not a subclass of `AppController`, I couldn't register any custom http codes into the response object of the `ErrorController` by handling controller events. A workaround would be to create my `AppErrorController`. But it's annoying little bit.\n\nSo what do you think about adding a new configuration to allow users to register custom http codes? The configuration and implementation would be like the following code:\n\n``` php\n// In config/app.php\n[\n    'App' => [\n        'customHttpCodes' => [\n            509 => 'Bandwidth Limit Exceeded',\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n```\n\n``` php\n// In src/Newtork/Response.php\n\npublic function __construct(array $options = [])\n{\n    ...\n\n    $codes = Configure::read('App.customHttpCodes');\n    if ($codes) {\n        $this->httpCodes($codes);\n    }\n}\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/225257585/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chinpei215","id":7399393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTkzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7399393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215","html_url":"https://github.com/chinpei215","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinpei215/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":688923310,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Njg4OTIzMzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/688923310","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-10T18:19:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":688923311,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDY4ODkyMzMxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/688923311","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-10T18:19:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/225258927","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/8962#issuecomment-225258927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/8962","id":225258927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTI1ODkyNw==","user":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-10T18:24:53Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T18:25:03Z","body":"@chinpei215

I mean that it doesn't solve #6094. Actually, we are using 404 for the error code of `RecordNotFoundException`. But theoretically, I think datasources should not be related with HTTP. It would be better to wrap `RecordNotFoundException` with `NotFoundException` in the dispather:\n\n``` php\ntry {\n    // invokeAction\n} catch (RecordNotFoundException $e) {\n    throw NotFoundException::wrapException($e);\n}\n```\n\nOr to add a feature to let `ExceptionRenderer`know which exceptions should be rendered as 404:\n\n``` php\nExceptionRenderer::mapExceptions([\n    'Cake\\Datasource\\Exception\\RecordNotFoundException' => 'Cake\\Network\\Exception\\NotFoundException',\n]);\n```\n\nI wanted to say that it would be nice if we could do it in the
