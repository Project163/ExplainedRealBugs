Description\n\nWhen I install a fresh copy of CakePHP and add the following line to `src/Application.php`'s `middleware()` method ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n->add(new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware(['disableOnDebug' => false]))\r\n```\r\n\r\n... I notice that the resulting redirect from http to https loses the base path of my installation.\r\n\r\nFor example, if my app is running at http://localhost/cakephp-test the forward actually takes me to https://localhost/ (i.e. it loses \"cakephp-test\"). Also if I go to http://localhost/cakephp-test/pages/home it redirects me to https://localhost/pages/home (also losing \"cakephp-test\").\r\n\r\nSo as soon as CakePHP is not running on the root of a domain, the HttpsEnforcer redirect breaks. Also verified by uploading it to a proper webserver.\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.3.0\n\n### PHP Version\n\n7.4","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16094/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16094/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
