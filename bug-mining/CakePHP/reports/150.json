is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.0\r\n* Platform and Target: Debian Buster\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nSee #5639 \r\nI have a column declared as \"TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL\". When I store the value \"false\" as a hidden field in a form it is read back and converted to NULL, which cannot be written back into the table.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nI get a database error indicating that NULL instead of false was written back\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nThat the value is converted back to false and written back as such instead of NULL\r\n\r\n\"Before you open an issue, please check if a similar issue already exists or has been closed before.\"\r\nYes, I did :)\r\n\r\nIn my form I write\r\n`echo $this->Form->control(\"<table>.<column>\", \"hidden\")`\r\nwhich produces the output\r\n`<input id=\"...\" type=\"hidden\" name=\"...\">`\r\nNote, that there is no `value=\"...\"` in the input field.\r\nOn submit, the POST parameter is empty, which translates to an empty string, which is marshaled as NULL in patchEntity.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, we have 4 different values of bool: true, false, and \"not a value\" aka null, and \"not specified\". A hidden field should somehow be able to distinguish between them, though I have no idea how to do that with the last 2 (null and undefined).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
