Description\n\nI may be missing something but while working on a test case that requires to mock a behavior, I am doing:\n\n```\n$behaviorMock = ....\n$behaviorMock->expects(...\n$MyModel->behaviors()->set('BehaviorName', $behaviorMock);\n```\n\nThe thing is that `load` method populates _methodMap and _finderMap but set does not so when trying to call a behavior method through the model:\n\n```\n$MyModel->behaviorMethod()\n```\n\nI get `Unknown method error`.\n\nI have no problem working on this but I would like to confirm if it is actually an issue or if I am doing something wrong.\n\nI have not confirmed if the issue is present on CakePHP 5 but according to a quick look at the code it should be the same. \n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.6.0\n\n### PHP
