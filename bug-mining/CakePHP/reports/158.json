did\r\nDefined a hasMany relation in the Companies Table (dependent)\r\n\r\nCompany -> hasMany -> HierarchyNodeLevels\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nWhen trying to delete a Company and no entries exist in the HierarchyNodeLevels the delete() operation fails:\r\n\r\nsql log:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nBEGIN\r\nDELETE FROM    hierarchy_node_levels  WHERE    company_id = 1\r\nROLLBACK\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen an entry exists in HierachyNodeLevels the deletion works just fine so I guess the rowCount of 0 might is misinterpreted somehow?\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\ndeletion should work just fine if hasMany is already empty (maybe the call can be skipped at all?","closed_by":{"login":"swiffer","id":2990373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTAzNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2990373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer","html_url":"https://github.com/swiffer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiffer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
