     ....\r\n        return $this->Categories->find('list');\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nthis  use in many use cases , but for now it executes with extra join\r\nand this changes user's program behavior and should be fix\r\nso as @markstory mentioned and labeled this issue , this is a bug and will fix\r\nunless we do this as new behavior and with documented this as behavior changed in cake 4\r\n
