is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.5.11\r\n* Platform and Target: Apache, Windows, PHP 7\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\n\r\nRead the paging parameters after using the paginate component.\r\n\r\n```\r\n            $posts = $this->paginate($this->Posts);\r\n            $pagingParams = $this->request->getParam('paging', []);\r\n            dd($pagingParams);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich generates this output.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n\t'Posts' => [\r\n\t\t'finder' => 'all',\r\n\t\t'page' => (int) 1,\r\n\t\t'current' => (int) 20,\r\n\t\t'count' => (int) 3133,\r\n\t\t'perPage' => (int) 20,\r\n\t\t'prevPage' => false,\r\n\t\t'nextPage' => true,\r\n\t\t'pageCount' => (int) 157,\r\n\t\t'sort' => null,\r\n\t\t'direction' => false,\r\n\t\t'limit' => null,\r\n\t\t'sortDefault' => false,\r\n\t\t'directionDefault' => false,\r\n\t\t'scope' => null\r\n\t],\r\n\t(int) 0 => false\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nWas only expecting to see `$pagingParams['Posts']` as the only array element and for the array to have only 1 element (`count($pagingParams) === 1`).\r\n\r\nThis array contains `0 => false` and I'm not sure why. So I'm assuming this is a bug, and that the array should only contain `Posts`.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11655/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
