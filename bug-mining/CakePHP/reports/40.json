This `order` option is used to reset `sort` and that is how links generated by PaginatorHelper::numbers()` end up with `sort=Posts.title` instead of `sort=Posts.title`. The sorting link generated by `PaginatorHelper::sort()` still uses the non prefix field `sort=title`.\r\n\r\n**Now this might seem like just a cosmetic issue but it becomes a real problem when `sortWhitelist` option is set.** \r\n\r\nIf I set `'sortWhitelist' => ['title']` then `Paginator::validateSort()` rejects the `sort` value from query string when it's `sort=Posts.title`. So to avoid the problem and ensure links generated by `PaginatorHelper::sort()` as well as `PaginatorHelper::number()` work I have to set the prefixed as well as non-prefixed version of a field in whitelist as `'sortWhitelist' => ['title', 'Posts.title']`. Such redundancy should not be required.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the issue the original value of `sort` from request query string should be maintained and not reset from `order`. Only in case where validation of `sort` value fails should `sort` be set to `null`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11740/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
