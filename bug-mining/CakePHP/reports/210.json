beforeDelete/afterDelete on the relationship contains incorrect Entity type\r\n\r\nTopicsController.php\r\n```\r\n// $data['groupings']['_ids'] = [];\r\n\r\n$topic = $this->Topics->patchEntity($topic, $data, ['associated'=>['Groupings']]);\r\n$this->Topics->save($topic, ['associated'=>['Groupings']])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTopicsTable.php\r\n```\r\n$this->belongsToMany('Groupings', [\r\n  'foreignKey' => 'topic_id',\r\n  'targetForeignKey' => 'group_id',\r\n  'through' => 'GroupTopics'\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nGroupTopics.php\r\n```\r\npublic function afterDelete(EventInterface $event, EntityInterface $entity, ArrayObject $options)\r\n{\r\n   dd($entity);\r\n\r\n  // expecting $entity of type App\\Model\\Entity\\GroupTopic\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  App\\Model\\Entity\\Grouping {#544\r\n  #_accessible:

[repository]: \"Groupings\"\r\n*/\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nbefore/after delete function contain an entity with wrong type but with correct data.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nentity type should be `App\\Model\\Entity\\GroupTopic` not `App\\Model\\Entity\\Grouping`\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15977/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
