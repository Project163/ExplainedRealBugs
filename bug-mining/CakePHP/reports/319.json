Description\n\nWhen you provide a Form URL with a _path as array option the Form still autofills plugin, controller and action. \nThis results in an Exception later on, when Router::unwrapShortString checks for unwanted array options.\n\nThe bug can be fixed by adding _path to the check in FormHelper::_formUrl. For example:\n\n```       \n        if (\n            is_string($options['url']) ||\n            (\n                is_array($options['url']) &&\n                    (\n                        isset($options['url']['_name']) ||\n                        isset($options['url']['_path'])\n                    )\n            )\n        ) {\n            return $options['url'];\n        }\n```\n\n\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n5.x\n\n### PHP Version\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
