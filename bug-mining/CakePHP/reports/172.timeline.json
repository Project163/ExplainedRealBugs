patch typecast numeric cell values to string in HtmlHelper::_renderCells() before passing it to HtmlHelper::tableCell(), while strict typehint \"String\" for HtmlHelper::tableCell() stays untouched.\r\nI personally would avoid to check if method \"__toString()\" exists if an class/object is passed, at the time of PHP-7.x, on a later PHP-8.x only release Uniontype typehint like \"stringable|string|int|float\" on HtmlHelper::tableCell() will do the trick for us in a much better way. \r\nOn type bool, everyone has his personal opinion.
