is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.1.1\r\n* Platform and Target: Debian Buster and others\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nI have a form in with a hidden boolean field which value is false.\r\nWith #14548 a value of false is stored (correctly) as '0', but for the SecurityComponent FormHelper#hidden returns the value as\r\n  (string)$option['val']\r\nsee FormHelper line 1635\r\nSo the SsecurityComponent expects the value to be an empty string \"\", but in POST it is \"0\", which causes validatePost to fail\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nSee above, POST data fails to validate\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nPOST validates, of course :)\r\nMy guess is that the security is called before BasicWidget had a change to change $option\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14834/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
