Mark, first of all thanks for the fix, but there is a problem, im trying the new release 4.1.5 and there is an 'error'.\r\n\r\nIn the first fix:\r\n```php\r\n$action = $controller->getRequest()->getParam('action', '');\r\nif (!$controller->isAction($action)) {\r\n    return null;   // $action is null ('') then return NULL, there is no action '' in the controller [OK]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the action was null, the function returns null (that's correct, there is no action null/'' in the controller)\r\n\r\nBut in the second fix\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/8917b09ae12af6056df7f417b59a2ccfc9bd778c\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$action = $controller->getRequest()->getParam('action');\r\nif ($action !== null && !$controller->isAction($action)) {\r\n    return null; //  $action is null an then there is no check for the action in the controller [KO].\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen the action is null there is no check for the action, so there is no return null wich is the expected result.\r\nThe first approach was correct, in the second the correct handling for the null value would be:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$action = $controller->getRequest()->getParam('action');\r\nif (is_null($action) || !$controller->isAction($action)) {\r\n    return null; //  $action is null an then the return is null (that return null as intended where no action is in the controller and avoids the execution of the next code in the function).\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPD: The reason for not having an action parameter in the controller is that i am not handling a request in it. I am reading each ../src/Controller/ folder (App and plugins) , to map the Acces Control Objects (ACOs) in a function called \r\n\r\n```php \r\ngetFolderACOs($plugin = null, $path = null){}\r\nI need to startup the controller for initialize AuthComponent in each controller to check if the action is already allowed\r\n...\r\n// ReflectionController\r\n$obController = $rcController->newInstance(); \r\n$obController->startupProcess();\r\n\r\n$allowed_actions = array_merge(\r\n$obController->Auth->allowedActions, \r\n    ['initialize', 'beforeFilter', 'beforeRender', 'beforeRedirect', 'afterFilter',
