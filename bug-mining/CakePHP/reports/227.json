Description\n\nI have noticed that if you call a deleteMany on the CacheEngine class with keys that could return false due to not existing in the cache it will stop running deleteMany entirely, i.e.\r\n````\r\n[\r\n    'key1',\r\n    'key2',\r\n]\r\n````\r\nKey1 does not exist but key2 does, but key2 will never be removed because key1 returns false from the function.\r\n\r\nThis also means this function has unpredictable behaviour depending on the order in which you place keys, so defo buggy.\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.3\n\n### PHP Version\n\n7.1","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16347/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
