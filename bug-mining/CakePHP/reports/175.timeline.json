But I think the most common use-case for the <input type=\"time\"> field is to capture hours and minutes without seconds. Unfortunately what comes from the browser is in HH:mm format. Chrome and Edge dismisses the seconds if you leave them empty. And using the attribute 'step=\"60\"' to prevent the browser from showing the seconds even Firefox sends HH:mm.\r\n\r\nI worked around the issue by generating a time-instance before marshal in my model. I used new FrozenTime() and this also excepts HH:mm to generate a correct time-instance.\r\n\r\nBesides that I expected a validation error when passing a value in a wrong format.

took a look at this and tracked it down to a difference in what the validator and time mapper accept as values.
