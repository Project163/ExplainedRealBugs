`$this->Html->tableHeaders()`, format is `['Text' => ['attribute' => 'value']]` ([docs](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/helpers/html.html#creating-table-headings)).\r\nTo set custom attributes for cells in `$this->Html->tableCells()`, format is `['Text', ['attribute' => 'value']]` ([docs](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/helpers/html.html#creating-table-cells)).\r\n\r\nEx. \r\n```php\r\necho $this->Html->tableHeaders([\r\n    ['Date' => ['class' => 'sortable']]\r\n    ['Name' => ['class' => 'highlight']]\r\n]);\r\n\r\necho $this->Html->tableCells([\r\n    ['Jul 7th, 2007', ['Best Brownies', ['class' => 'highlight']]],\r\n    ['Jun 21st, 2007', 'Smart Cookies'],\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nBoth should support same format.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13465/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
