This seems to work and it gives me the info I'm after.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* I'm using the cakephp/database package, not the full cake package.\r\n* Its sibling `listTablesWithoutViewsSql()` is similarly affected. \r\n* `describeForeignKeySql()` also uses `$config['database'])`, not sure if that needs work, too.\r\n* The according functions for other DBs seem to not retrieve this parameter from the array, so they seem to not be affected, but I haven't really verified that.\r\n* I don't really know what is expected from the `$config` array. It could be that my app is messed up, so that this array just isn't populated correctly. I'd welcome feedback on that matter. Alternatively, some `assert()`s in the code would help, too.\r\n\r\n\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.4.5\n\n### PHP Version\n\n7.4.30","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
