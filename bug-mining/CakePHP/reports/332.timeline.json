I would like to thank @ADmad for promptly solving my issue. :+1:\n\nHowever I think the current approach of assuming plural rules is a hack that has caused bugs in the past (Arabic in #5348; Turkish in #13209), is causing a bug now, and will certainly cause other bugs in the future, the kind of which are going largely unnoticed for years until reported, if ever, especially for minor languages.
