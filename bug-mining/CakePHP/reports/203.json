However, since the parameter type is actually `string`, this is now deprecated.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstrlen(): Passing null to parameter #1 ($string) of type string is deprecated\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne common scenario that triggers this deprecation is using the primary key from an entity. `EntityTrait::get()` currently returns null for a missing field. Since the primary key is an array type, this creates an array of null values.\r\n\r\nExample from `BelongsToMany` association.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        $bindingKey = (array)$this->getBindingKey();\r\n        $primaryValue = $sourceEntity->extract($bindingKey);\r\n\r\n        if (count(array_filter($primaryValue, 'strlen')) !== count($bindingKey)) {\r\n            $message = 'Could not find primary key value for source entity';\r\n            throw new InvalidArgumentException($message);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother example from `IsUnique` vaildation rule.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if ($entity->isNew() === false) {\r\n            $keys = (array)$options['repository']->getPrimaryKey();\r\n            $keys = $this->_alias($alias, $entity->extract($keys));\r\n            if (array_filter($keys, 'strlen')) {\r\n                $conditions['NOT'] = $keys;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15539/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
