is a:\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\nCakePHP Version: 3.7.3\r\n\r\nGist with necessary files to reproduce here:\r\n[https://gist.github.com/andres-ml/93aea170698a0e1607c2cf6e135a0028](https://gist.github.com/andres-ml/93aea170698a0e1607c2cf6e135a0028)\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nSave an entity with nested associations that don't pass rules check using the saveOrFail() method.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nNotice Error: Array to string conversion in [(...)/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/ORM/Exception/PersistenceFailedException.php, line 76]\r\nAlso, the exception's error message shows \"Array\" instead of an error message:\r\nEntity save failure (association: \"Array\")\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nAt least, the error shouldn't trigger. As of how the error message should be, I'm not sure; maybe a comma-separated list of all errors.\r\n\r\n### Possible fix\r\nMaking PersistenceFailedException::buildError recursive (line 73):\r\n`$errors[] = is_int($key) ? static::buildError($message) : $key;`","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
