is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.5.18\r\n* Platform and Target: Only Integration Test class which extends IntegrationTestCase. this issue not happen on product.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nI tried to test PUT Request which change user data by Integration Test.\r\n```php\r\nclass ChangeUserDataApiTest extends IntegrationTestCase\r\n{\r\n    public function testPut()\r\n    {\r\n        $this->configRequest([\r\n            'headers' => [\r\n                'Accept' => 'application/json',\r\n                'Content-Type' => 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',\r\n            ],\r\n        ]);\r\n\r\n        // user cookie\r\n        $this->cookie('hoge', 'hoge');\r\n        $this->cookieEncrypted('fuga', 'fuga');\r\n\r\n        $this->put('/change-user-data-api', ['name' => 'test']);\r\n\r\n        $this->assertResponseCode(204);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nthis test failed and return 500 status code.\r\n\r\nI injected following code in controller which I try to test.\r\n```php\r\nvar_export($this->request->getData());\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected that `array ('name' => 'test' )` is printed, but `array()`.\r\n\r\nthis not reproduced on product code. only Integration Test.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI want to test PUT request with `x-www-form-urlencoded` header.\r\nI expected that `ServerRequest::getData()` return second argument of `$this->put` on Integration Test.","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14565/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
