Regardless of the value of the `$full` param, the host is prepended to the url\r\n - The `_scheme` and `_port` default to default values.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n - The value of the `$full` param should determine if the host is prepended (but maybe there is a reason for this?)\r\n - The `_scheme` and `_port` should use the current request values\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\nThe request context is copied in `$hostOptions` here:\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/Routing/Route/Route.php#L610\r\n\r\nHowever when the code hits \r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/Routing/Route/Route.php#L623\r\n\r\nThen the `_scheme` and `_port` are not copied from the `$context`. It can either be solved by:\r\n - copy-ing the context on that location as well.\r\n - move the context copy if block below the `_host` option application.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
