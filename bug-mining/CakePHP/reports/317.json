Description\n\nToday I tried to use the `$requireFieldPresence` property on an entire entity (I've never done that before), so directly in its class as `true`.\n\nOddly enough, however, this knocks out all forms tied to that entity, apparently because of the hidden `_csrf` field.\n\nAn excerpt from the exception (I overridden `FormHelper::create()` as you can see, but only to add options to all forms on the entire application):\n```\nCake\\Datasource\\Exception\\MissingPropertyException: Property `_csrfToken` does not exist for the entity `App\\Model\\Entity\\PatientsWeight`.\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Datasource/EntityTrait.php:337\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Datasource/EntityTrait.php:1107\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Datasource/EntityTrait.php:1028\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/View/Form/EntityContext.php:738\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/View/Form/EntityContext.php:712\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/View/Helper/FormHelper.php:2434\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/View/Helper/FormHelper.php:1731\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/View/Helper/FormHelper.php:558\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/View/Helper/FormHelper.php:480\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/vendor/friendsofcake/bootstrap-ui/src/View/Helper/FormHelper.php:383\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/src/View/Helper/FormHelper.php:68\n/home/mirko/Server/climat/templates/PatientsWeights/form.php:23\n```\n\nI am using `SessionCsrfProtectionMiddleware` and the csfr token is correctly present, but I don't think it depends on these things. Nor do I think it depends on my configuration (although I'm not entirely sure, I'm investigating).\n\nIt seems to me that the problem arises when that field is initialized with `FormHelper::_initInputField()`: it checks if there are any errors (to add the relevant classes to the field), calling `hasError()` on the entity.\n\nOf course, since that entity doesn't actually have the `_csrfToken` property (which it's looking for errors for), we get this exception.\n\nI don't know if this is normal behavior, I don't think so. Am I doing something wrong? Maybe, normally, `$requireFieldPresence` should be used on a single piece of code, activating and deactivating it with its method, and not on the entire entity and always?\n\nThanks.\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n5.1.5\n\n### PHP Version\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
