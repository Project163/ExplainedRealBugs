Create a [custom exception handler](https://book.cakephp.org/5/en/development/errors.html#custom-exceptionrenderer)\n2. Add a method, and write logic to operate the controller from the outside\n3. make a template.\n\nInstead a better workflow would be to use controller actions. We package an `ErrorController` in each application so modifying this class will be lower friction. If `ErrorController` has a method that matches the exception type the method will be called. For example:\n\n- The `MissingWidgetException` would call the `missingWidget` method. \n- The   `templates/Error/missing_widget.php` template would be rendered.\n \nThis is effectively lifting the exception renderer interface up to the controller. I think this will help simplify building custom error rendering.\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17958/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17958/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
