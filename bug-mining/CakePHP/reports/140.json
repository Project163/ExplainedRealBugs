is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.0.5\r\n* Platform and Target: WAMP\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nExample from docs https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/core-libraries/collections.html#Cake\\Collection\\Collection::listNested:\r\n```\r\n$collection = new Collection([\r\n    ['id' => 1, 'parent_id' => null, 'name' => 'Birds'],\r\n    ['id' => 2, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Land Birds'],\r\n    ['id' => 3, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Eagle'],\r\n    ['id' => 4, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Seagull'],\r\n    ['id' => 5, 'parent_id' => 6, 'name' => 'Clown Fish'],\r\n    ['id' => 6, 'parent_id' => null, 'name' => 'Fish'],\r\n]);\r\n\r\npr($collection->listNested()->printer('name', 'id', '---'));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nReturns:\r\n```\r\nArray\r\n(\r\n    [0] => Birds\r\n    [1] => Land Birds\r\n    [2] => Eagle\r\n    [3] => Seagull\r\n    [4] => Clown Fish\r\n    [5] => Fish\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nShould return:\r\n```\r\nArray\r\n(\r\n    [0] => Birds\r\n    [1] => ---Land Birds\r\n    [2] => ---Eagle\r\n    [3] => ---Seagull\r\n    [5] => Fish\r\n    [4] => ---Clown Fish\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think, there are two problems, first there is no added spacer to string, second `Clown Fish` should be under `Fish`.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
