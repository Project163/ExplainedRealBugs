is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.7.1 and 3.7.3\r\n* Platform and Target: apache2 (not relevant), PHP 5.6.38, MySQL 5.5.62\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nI am using the CakePHP ORM only.\r\nI have the following table:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE `thing` (\r\n\t`somedate` DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00',\r\n\t`someval` FLOAT NULL DEFAULT NULL,\r\n\tPRIMARY KEY (`somedate`)\r\n)\r\nCOLLATE='utf8_general_ci'\r\nENGINE=InnoDB\r\n;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the following code, which creates a record:\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nrequire_once \"vendor/autoload.php\";\r\nrequire_once(\"config.php\"); // DB_ constants here\r\n\r\nuse Cake\\Datasource\\ConnectionManager;\r\nuse Cake\\ORM\\Locator\\TableLocator;\r\n\r\nConnectionManager::setConfig('default', [\r\n    'className' => 'Cake\\Database\\Connection',\r\n    'driver' => 'Cake\\Database\\Driver\\Mysql',\r\n    'persistent' => false,\r\n    'host' => DB_HOST,\r\n    'username' => DB_USER,\r\n    'password' => DB_PASS,\r\n    'database' => DB_NAME,\r\n    'encoding' => 'latin1',\r\n    'timezone' => 'UTC',\r\n    'cacheMetadata' => false,\r\n]);\r\n\r\n$locator = new TableLocator();\r\n$things = $locator->get('Thing');\r\n$thing = $things->newEntity([\r\n    \"somedate\" => \"2018-01-01\",\r\n    \"someval\" => 22,\r\n]);\r\n$things->save($thing);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nWhen the record is new (that is, we do an insert and not an update) PHP complains:\r\n```\r\nPHP Warning:  strlen() expects parameter 1 to be string, object given in /var/www/cake_test/vendor/cakephp/orm/Table.php on line 2089\r\n```\r\n\r\n[That line](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/b0b9a3713720b30cd8e90c8b1a317a8294b2513a/src/ORM/Table.php#L2089) is running strlen over the values of the primary key - that is, over the following array:\r\n```php\r\n[\"somedate\" => new \\DateTime(\"2018-01-01\")]\r\n```\r\nNow I don't know what the point of that line is, but obviously running strlen on a DateTime doesn't make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expect no warnings.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12920/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
