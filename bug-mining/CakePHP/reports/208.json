is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.2.8\r\n* Platform and Target: nginx, php-fpm 7.4.23\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nAfter update from 4.1.7, where issue with malformed/crafted cookies/form-params was manifested by NoticeException **Array to string conversion** on line 300 of vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Middleware/CsrfProtectionMiddleware.php\r\n\r\nIn 4.2.8 it's manifested by TypeError **strlen() expects parameter 1 to be string, bool given** on line 281 of vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Middleware/CsrfProtectionMiddleware.php\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nSomeone enumerating/bruteforcing endpoints crafted request and provided invalid values where CsrfProtectionMiddleware expected valid, previously framework-set, data.\r\n\r\nstacktrace here:\r\n```\r\n#0 /var/www/cakephp.app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Middleware/CsrfProtectionMiddleware.php(281): strlen()\r\n#1 /var/www/cakephp.app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Middleware/CsrfProtectionMiddleware.php(153): Cake\\Http\\Middleware\\CsrfProtectionMiddleware->saltToken()\r\n#2 /var/www/cakephp.app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Runner.php(73): App\\Middleware\\CsrfUserProtectionMiddleware->process()\r\n#3 /var/www/cakephp.app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Error/Middleware/ErrorHandlerMiddleware.php(126): Cake\\Http\\Runner->handle()\r\n#4 /var/www/cakephp.app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Runner.php(73): Cake\\Error\\Middleware\\ErrorHandlerMiddleware->process()\r\n#5 /var/www/cakephp.app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Runner.php(73): App\\Middleware\\TrustProxyMiddleware->process()\r\n#6 /var/www/cakephp.app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Runner.php(58): Cake\\Http\\Runner->handle()\r\n#7 /var/www/cakephp.app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Server.php(90): Cake\\Http\\Runner->run()\r\n#8 /var/www/cakephp.app/webroot/index.php(40): Cake\\Http\\Server->run()\r\n#9 {main}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nInvalid value in cookie/form-params, should be detected and handled, instead of relying on php TypeError faults\r\nBase64_Decode return signature is string|false, and for any kind of invalid value, this should be handled gracefuly, so the client (web user) is not permanently cut out from the app, just because he has invalid cookie data, that prevents him from being able to access the
