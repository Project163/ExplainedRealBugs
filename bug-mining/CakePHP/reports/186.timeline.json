the ORM was attempting to clear the junction records for a BelongsToMany junction table there were a few related problems causing it to fail:\r\n\r\n1. The query used to locate the junction records did not have the   correct types set for where conditions.\r\n2. If the junction table has a surrogate primary key that has    a different datatype than the association target table, the ORM    would use the target table type. In the committed fixtures this means    that the `id` column on the junction table would be typed as    `binaryuuid` instead of `integer`.\r\n\r\nThese factors combined together would result in either junction rows not being deleted. Thankfully the query to find junction records would always fail preventing more serious data corruption issues.\r\n\r\nThese problems can be solved by applying conditions *after* adding the junction join information and type mappings, and also setting junction table types for our aliased entity query.\r\n\r\nI optimized object traversal inside the `_appendJunctionJoin` method as there were some redundant calls being ade.\r\n\r\nFixes #15212","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4128126636,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDEyODEyNjYzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/4128126636","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-18T04:52:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
