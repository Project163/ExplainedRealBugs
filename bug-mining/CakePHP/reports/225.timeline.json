I have a action that need three params publuc function list (string $search,array $filter,bool $redirect). This action is also used in another controller that extends a special controller. I use a route Class that exctract, the params from the url /cleaner,b-vanish:dr.schnell,s-500ml:600ml.html. The params are there extracted as array [ 'b' => ['vanisch','dr.schnell','s'=>['500ml','600ml']]. This is the filter array that are i needed in the action. The routing Class prepare that and added this to $params['pass']. But the params must cake like converted to string and i lost the key on this way. When I remove the type in the method parameter list, that no problem and no conversion in the controllerfactory, but no type in method param list is like a workaround.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\nThe best way to propose a feature is to open an issue first and discuss your ideas there before implementing them.\r\n\r\nAlways follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) when submitting a pull request. In particular, make sure existing tests still pass, and add tests for all new behavior. When fixing a bug, you may want to add a test to verify the fix.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6051322651,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAoEbs5DLDfgzwAAAAFor9sb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/6051322651","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"94de0857f33b20026791e190bb2725a882c88ea4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/commits/94de0857f33b20026791e190bb2725a882c88ea4","created_at":"2022-02-11T13:34:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6051830542,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAoEbs5DLDfgzwAAAAFot5sO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/6051830542","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-11T14:49:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
