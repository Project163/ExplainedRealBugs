Description\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nI try to insert a new value into an existing array with conditions using `Hash::insert`. \r\n\r\n```php\r\n$data = [\r\n            0 => ['up' => true, 'Item' => ['id' => 1, 'title' => 'first']],\r\n            1 => ['Item' => ['id' => 2, 'title' => 'second']],\r\n            2 => ['Item' => ['id' => 3, 'title' => 'third']],\r\n            3 => ['Item' => ['id' => 3, 'title' => 'third']],\r\n            4 => ['up' => true, 'Item' => ['id' => 4, 'title' => 'fourth']],\r\n            5 => ['Item' => ['id' => 4, 'title' => 'fifth']],\r\n        ];\r\n        \r\n```\r\nIf I try to insert data using `{s}` string wildcard, I get following error\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$result = Hash::insert($data, '{n}.{s}[id=4].new', 9);\r\n\r\n        /**\r\n         * PHP Fatal

wildcard with a fixed key `Item` it works as expected \r\n\r\n```php\r\n $result = Hash::insert($data, '{n}.Item[id=4].new', 9); // no errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nHash extract has no issue with using `{s}` wildcard\r\n\r\n```php\r\n $result = Hash::extract($data, '{n}.{s}[id=4]');\r\n/**\r\n        array:2 [\r\n            0 => array:2 [\r\n                \"id\" => 4\r\n                \"title\" => \"fourth\"\r\n            ]\r\n            1 => array:2 [\r\n                \"id\" => 4\r\n                \"title\" => \"fifth\"\r\n            ]\r\n        ]\r\n */\r\n```\r\nMy expected behavior would be that `Hash::insert` could use the same syntax as `Hash::extract` \n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.5.3\n\n### PHP
