Description\n\nSince I'm unable to re-open previous ticket on this ( #15868 ), i'm opening new one\r\n\r\nFix that was provided in #15920 addresses the correct behavior for re-generating token on GET requests, if current value is invalid/unexpected\r\n\r\nHowever that did not fix (as we found out today in testing) the TypeError that is thrown instead of expected InvalidCsrfTokenException\r\n```\r\nerror: [TypeError] strlen() expects parameter 1 to be string, bool given in /var/www/app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Http/Middleware/CsrfProtectionMiddleware.php on line 345\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn current version of https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/4.x/src/Http/Middleware/CsrfProtectionMiddleware.php\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1) Request is POST/PUT/PATCH\r\n2) cookie contains no data or data that are not valid per `isHexadecimalToken` call\r\n3) Line 343 will attempt to decode the data as base64 encoded value\r\n4) base64_decode with param strict=true will return \"false\" (bool) for invalid base64 data\r\n5) Line 345 assumes the $decoded contains string (strlen call), however that contains boolean\r\n6) Instead of \" return false;\" we hit TypeError and subsequently InvalidCsrfTokenException on line 394 is never created/thrown\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\nReplace (in _verifyToken procedure)\r\n```php\r\n        if (strlen($decoded) <= static::TOKEN_VALUE_LENGTH) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nwith this\r\n```php\r\n        if (!is_string($decoded) || strlen($decoded) <= static::TOKEN_VALUE_LENGTH) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n```\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.2.10\n\n### PHP
