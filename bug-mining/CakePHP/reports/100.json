is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.8.0\r\n* Platform and Target: PHP 7.2.19-0ubuntu0.18.04.1 with PHPUnit 6.5.14\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nIn my phpunit test:\r\n```\r\n    use EmailTrait;\r\n```\r\nIn my code:\r\n```\r\nprivate static function sendMail() {\r\n    $email = new Email('default')->setFrom(...)->setTo(...)->....;\r\n    $sent = $email->send();\r\n    self::verifySent($sent, $email);\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate static function verifySent(array $sent, Email $email): array\r\n{\r\n    ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThe sent function could not be called:\r\n ```\r\n2019-08-13 13:31:25 Error: [TypeError] Argument 1 passed to App\\Service\\EmailService::verifySent() must be of the type array, boolean given\r\n```\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nThe sent function can be called\r\n\r\n### Why did that happen\r\n\r\n`\\Cake\\Mailer\\AbstractTransport::send` declares to `@return array` and we trusted this when developing our code.\r\n\r\nSadly, `\\Cake\\TestSuite\\TestEmailTransport::send` breaks that promise given by its parent class by returning `@return bool`\r\n\r\nI guess you'll also stumble over this when you're trying to get more typed in cake
