What you did\r\n\r\n1. Create new project with `composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app`\r\n2. Create a DB with table \"mytable\"\r\n3. Bake controller `bin/cake bake controller Mytable`\r\n4.

Check for the exception in the test created by `bake`\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MytableControllerTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n     public function testIndex(): void\r\n    {\r\n        $this->disableErrorHandlerMiddleware();\r\n        $this->expectException(\\Exception::class);\r\n        $this->get('/mytable/index');\r\n```\r\n6.
