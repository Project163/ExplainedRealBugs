In particular, make sure existing tests still pass, and add tests for all new behavior. When fixing a bug, you may want to add a test to verify the

you did\r\nSince CakePHP 4.1 the `contain()` method is case sensitive which breaks all my contain calls.\r\n\r\nBreaking commit: https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/ed139f76079d8be07ae32368559c38308200b818\r\n\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n```php\r\n        $this->belongsToMany('Hosttemplates', [\r\n            'className'        => 'Hosttemplates',\r\n            'foreignKey'       => 'hostgroup_id',\r\n            'targetForeignKey' => 'hosttemplate_id',\r\n            'joinTable'        =>

The `hosttemplates` association is not defined on `Hostgroups`.\r\nValid associations are: Containers, Hosts, Hosttemplates, Mapitems, Maplines, Mapsummaryitems in /opt/openitc/frontend/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/ORM/Table.php on line 903\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nRetrieving the data like with CakePHP 4.0.9.\r\n\r\nWhy are my contain()'s lower case you ask? This is because a find() also returns all association keys as lower key. The documentation is not clear on that. It's even not mentioned.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that this code was running since the 4.x-dev days - this is a breaking change in a dot release. Even if I was doing it wrong.\r\n\r\nFull example: https://gist.github.com/nook24/1ca026b8dcada23fc36f558016a4f4ef\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease don't get me wrong. It's not about that I do not want to patch my code. Changing a behavior, even if it's wrong, should not be done from one release to another.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14770/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
