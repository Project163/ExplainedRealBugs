Set up a new project with a `composer.json` requiring cakephp/database:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"cakephp/database\": \"3.7.1\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. `composer install`\r\n3. Run any of the example code from the cakephp/database repository README\r\n\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nFailure due to `Cake\\Log\\Log` unable to be found.\r\n\r\nThere are two places this is referenced in the CakePHP database code:\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/database/blob/a7200722b2fbf22502700b9d8515581007616a77/Log/QueryLogger.php#L17\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/database/blob/73f20ff84f032923b23627f28049044a7c264977/Connection.php#L30\r\n\r\nThe `composer.json` of cakephp/database lists cakephp/log as a suggested package, but due to the above lines it is actually a requirement:\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/database/blob/master/composer.json#L33\r\n\r\n### What I expected to happen\r\nI would expect the cakephp/database repository's `composer.json` to list cakephp/log as a requirement since it is required in order to run.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12861/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
