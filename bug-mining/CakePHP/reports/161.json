$query->all()`. For debugging I call `debug($result);`\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nWith 4.1. this error is thrown\r\n`Argument 1 passed to Cake\\Error\\Debug\\PropertyNode::__construct() must be of the type string, int given, called in C:\\ ... \\vendor\\cakephp\\cakephp\\src\\Error\\Debugger.php on line 745\r\n`\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expected an output as with 4.0.8 with no errors.\r\n\r\nHint: With `$result = $query->toArray()`. + `debug($result);` in 4.1 the output is very nice with the new \"unfold / fold\" possibility.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14772/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14772/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
