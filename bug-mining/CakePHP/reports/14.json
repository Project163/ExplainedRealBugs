One of the issues is that any PDOException will leave the MySQL server with buffering disabled. Here's the `MysqlStatement.php` file with the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public function execute($params = null)\r\n    {\r\n        $this->_driver->connection()->setAttribute(PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY, $this->_bufferResults);\r\n        $result = $this->_statement->execute($params);\r\n        $this->_driver->connection()->setAttribute(PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY, true);\r\n\r\n        return $result;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the `execute($params)` throws an exception, then buffering is not restored. If you have persistent connection enabled, then the next web request is going to fail with a bunch of MySQL errors about unbuffered queries with the type of fetch you make with PDO.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nI was expecting this to **only** change the ResultSet handling of entities while iterating the records. I didn't expect this to alter the state of MySQL.\r\n\r\nThis setting is coupled together to do two very different things.\r\n\r\nPlease discuss why.
