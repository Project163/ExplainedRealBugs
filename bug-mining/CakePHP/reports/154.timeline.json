Can you show the html output that is generated and what you expect?\r\n\r\nSetting the step does work to remove the step attribute, however, removing the step alone does not remove the seconds (at least not in Firefox), you must also remove the seconds from the input value:\r\n\r\n**No step and no value (and no seconds):**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<html>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <form>\r\n      <input type=\"time\">\r\n    </form>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**No step but with a value (and with seconds):**\r\n```\r\n<html>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <form>\r\n      <input type=\"time\" value=\"11:00:00\">\r\n    </form>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven if a time without seconds is supplied to FormHelper, \"11:00\" for example, there is a function within the DateTimeWidget that converts it into predefined formats:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprotected $formatMap = [\r\n  'datetime-local' => 'Y-m-d\\TH:i:s',\r\n  'date' => 'Y-m-d',\r\n  'time' => 'H:i:s',\r\n  'month' => 'Y-m',\r\n  'week' => 'Y-\\WW',\r\n];\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n$data['value'] = $this->formatDateTime($data['val'], $data);\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer the [Mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time#Time_value_format), if seconds are supplied in the value, then seconds show in the input. Due to this reason, the FormHelper format defaults need overwritten so that seconds are omitted from the value used in the final HTML output.\r\n\r\nIt's the combination of having no step **and** having no seconds in the input's value that allows the format to omit seconds.\r\n\r\nSee PR #14612
