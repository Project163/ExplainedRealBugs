you did\r\n\r\nYou have to use `IdentifierExpression` object in custom expressions if you're referencing a column name.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$query->newExpr()->lt('counter', new IdentifierExpression('max_value'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\n`IdentifierExpression` gets IDE warning of invalid usage because it's marked as an `@internal` class to CakePHP.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nCan we remove this phpdoc annotation?","closed_by":{"login":"thinkingmedia","id":551022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTAyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/551022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia","html_url":"https://github.com/thinkingmedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkingmedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/10085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/10085/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
