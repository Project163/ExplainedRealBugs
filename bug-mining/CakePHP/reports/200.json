is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.x / 4.x\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn the [**Using Custom Validation Rules**](https://book.cakephp.org/3/en/core-libraries/validation.html#using-custom-validation-rules) ([**4.x**](https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/core-libraries/validation.html#using-custom-validation-rules)) section of the docs, there's an example that shows using an array as a validation rule provider to pass additional data into the validator.\r\n\r\nAccording to the API docs, that's not supported, as [**`Validator::setProvider()`**](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/3.8.12/src/Validation/Validator.php#L251) expects `object|string`, and there's also no tests for that use case.\r\n\r\nEither the API docs need to be updated, or the Cookbook... or both, detailing that providers don't necessarily have to be _validation rule_ providers. Or maybe there should be an additional feature specifically ment for exposing arbitrary data to the validation rules.","closed_by":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14703/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
