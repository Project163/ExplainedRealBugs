configuring session details in config/app.php, using defaults 'database', a runtime exception is being thrown because of incorrect defaults values.\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.6.10\r\n* Platform and Target: Apache 2.4.29, PHP 7.2.8\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nA following session, running fine on  PHP 7.0.22, breaks after upgrading to PHP 7.2.8:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'Session' => [\r\n        'defaults' => 'database',\r\n        'cookie' => 'cookie',\r\n        'timeout' => 0,\r\n        'cookieTimeout' => 0,\r\n        'autoRegenerate' => true,\r\n        'checkAgent' => false,\r\n        'ini' => [\r\n            'session.cookie_lifetime' => 180\r\n        ]\r\n    ],\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nIt emits following warning:\r\n```\r\nWarning (4096): ini_set(): Cannot set 'user' save handler by ini_set() or session_module_name()\r\n```\r\nas well as throwing:\r\n```\r\nError: [RuntimeException] Unable to configure the session, setting session.save_handler failed. #0 /var/www/cake3-app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Network/Session.php(214)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nA session should be configured and running properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to fix\r\nRemoving ```'defaults'  => 'database'``` fixes the issue. The problem lies in file\r\n```vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Network/Session.php:166 ``` These defaults should not set ```'user'``` as session hanlder as it is being checked in ```vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Network/Session.php:113 ```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
