Use request->getRequestTarget() instead. - /www/myapp/src/Template/Layout/front.ctp, Line 45` so I used `getRequestTarget() ` instead of `here`\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expected that `request->getRequestTarget()` will return the same reult from `request->here` but this was not the case. As I told you above that my app is localed at http://development.local/myapp/\r\nin 3.5 & 3.6, `request->here` returns `/myapp/` but on 3.6 `request->getRequestTarget()` returns `/` which is a different result and it should return `/myapp/`\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11977/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
