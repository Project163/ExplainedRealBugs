URLs mostly. Super simple example to illustrate the point without detracting from the issue...\r\n\r\nI have records that were created with primary keys that have a UUID (or some other unique string) on them. Then there are printed labels that were intended to be consumed with a barcode scanner (inventory system). This lets me print out a label using a UUID which references a record which could be rotated out at some point in the future (e.g. A piece of hardware dies and needs to be swapped out). The scanner can always hit a single URL like `/devices/:uuid`. Well, these UUIDs frequently end up in spreadsheets or pasted into searches which check against many fields.\r\n\r\nThe example initially reported by this issue is really specific to UUID but can be reproduced with any string that PHP would try to cast:\r\n\r\n- IPv4: `(int)\"6.7.8.9\"`\r\n- MAC Address: `(int)\"06:41:ea:3a:12:37\"`\r\n- Serial numbers: `(int)\"06N2244\"`\r\n\r\nAs the application grows and there are more integrations (e.g. Saltstack, customer APIs, developers in other departments, etc) which want to reference the same record in different ways:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// DevicesTable.php\r\npublic function findDevice(Query $query, array $options = []): Query\r\n{\r\n    return $query->where([\r\n        'OR' => [\r\n            [$this->aliasField('id IN') => (array)$options['device']],\r\n            [$this->aliasField('uuid IN') => (array)$options['device']],\r\n            [$this->aliasField('label IN') => (array)$options['device']],\r\n            [$this->aliasField('serial_number IN') => (array)$options['device']],\r\n            [$this->aliasField('ip_assignment IN') => (array)$options['device']],\r\n        ],\r\n    ]);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// DevicesController.php\r\npublic function search()\r\n{\r\n    $queryParams = $this->request->getQueryParams();\r\n    $devices = $this->Devices->find('all', $queryParams)->limit(10);\r\n    $this->set('devices', $devices);\r\n    $this->set('_serialize', ['devices']);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// DeviceUuidMiddleware.php\r\npublic function __invoke(ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response, callable $next): ResponseInterface\r\n{\r\n    if ((bool)preg_match('^/\\/devices\\/' . Router::UUID . '/', $request->getRequestTarget()) !== false) {\r\n        $request = $this->replaceDeviceUuid($request); // /devices/6a88accf-a34e-4dd9-ade0-8d255ccaecbe -> /devices/1\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return $next($request, $response);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe application itself is only ever concerned with the primary key, but the device can be accessed using any of the other unique references to it in the same way as the primary key.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/416279097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sdustinh","id":2855100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTUxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2855100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh","html_url":"https://github.com/sdustinh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdustinh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1810984660,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgxMDk4NDY2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/1810984660","actor":{"login":"lorenzo","id":37621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-27T16:10:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1810984664,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MTA5ODQ2NjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/1810984664","actor":{"login":"lorenzo","id":37621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-27T16:11:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/416285734","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12509#issuecomment-416285734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12509","id":416285734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjI4NTczNA==","user":{"login":"lorenzo","id":37621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-27T16:32:35Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T16:32:35Z","body":"The

File causing issue: src/Database/Type/DecimalType.php:106\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nOur code is trying to marshall non well formed decimal value (string using comma as decimal separator) into DecimalType database field, which worked up to change in commit mentioned above. \r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nDecimalType method marshall returned null due to removal of !is_scalar($value) condition.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nMethod should return value if it's scalar as it did in previous version (up to specified commit) as values could be parsed to correct format by entity setters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12800/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12800/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
