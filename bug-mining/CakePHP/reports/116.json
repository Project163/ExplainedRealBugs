In my validation rules i want to specify that a certain field can only be '1' if another field is null. In order to achieve this, I use the validation rule `['compareFields', 'automatic_sorting', Validation::COMPARE_NOT_SAME]`\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThe validation rule above ALWAYS triggers a validation error, because in `Cake\\Validation\\Validation` the code is\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static function compareFields($check, $field, $operator, $context)\r\n    {\r\n        if (!isset($context['data'][$field])) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return static::comparison($check, $operator, $context['data'][$field]);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI think instead of using `!isset()` the function `!array_key_exists()` should be used here. Otherwise it's impossible to compare with null values.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13834/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
