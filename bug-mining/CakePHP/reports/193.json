did\r\nI tried to patch an entity with form data that contained an UploadedImage object.\r\nI also have the following validation rule:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$validator->add('image', 'largeurImageInvalide', [\r\n    'rule' => ['imageWidth', '==', 640],\r\n    'message' => __('The image width must be 640 pixels.'),\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n`'Argument 1 passed to Cake\\Validation\\Validation::imageWidth() must be of the type array, object given'.`\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nValidation should not throw an error.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
