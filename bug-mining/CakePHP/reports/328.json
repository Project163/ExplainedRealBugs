Description\n\nWhen a `MissingActionException` is thrown, the default error template `Error/missing_action.php` (which is used in debug mode) results in multiple warnings `Undefined variable`:\n\n``` \nWarning (2): Undefined variable $class [in /myapp/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/templates/Error/missing_action.php, line 67]\nWarning (2): Undefined variable $action [in

details about the exception.\n\nI was able to reproduce this behaviour in a completely new app by using:\n\n```\ncomposer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app:5 myapp\nbin/cake bake controller Test\n```\nWhen requesting the url `https://localhost/myapp/test/non-existing-action`, the output of the view rendering looks like this:\n\n<img width=\"1179\" alt=\"Image\"
