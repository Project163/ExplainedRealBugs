This POST request consists of some header information (for the Digest authentication) and two other basic headers:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAccept:application/json\r\nAuthorization:Digest xxx\r\nContent-Type:application/json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe body contains:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"message\": \"test\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my controller (in my case, in the initialize() method, just after loading the `RequestHandler` component), I try to get the input of the sent JSON by using:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# load other components\r\n$this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');\r\ndebug($this->request->input('json_decode'));\r\nexit;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nNo data was returned, in fact, I got `NULL`.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expected an object, containing my JSON data.\r\n\r\n### Research\r\nSo I did some research.\r\n\r\nCalling `$this->request->input()` returns the string `php://input`, which is weird. (I didn't even know what this was). So I Googled it, and found that this stream should contain my data. Calling `file_get_contents('php://input')` did in fact return my raw JSON. So, I know the server is receiving my data.\r\n\r\nUpon further inspection and a lot of debugging later, I found that within ServerRequest, the $stream is [fed by the $config](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/3.next/src/Http/ServerRequest.php#L327)\r\n\r\nSo, `debug($config)` then, gave me 'php://input' as well. Although the [docs of `$stream->write()`](https://github.com/php-fig/http-message/blob/master/src/StreamInterface.php#L109) say:\r\n\r\n>   * Write data to the stream.\r\n     * @param string $string The string that is to be written.\r\n\r\nSo, it expects that actual data, not the name of the stream/file.\r\n\r\nBut still, didn't know what was happening. So after some more research and great help of @hmic in the IRC, I figured it all out.\r\n\r\n[ServerRequestFactory.php#L53](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/3.next/src/Http/ServerRequestFactory.php#L53) is hard coding the string \"php://input\" to the config of ServerRequest despite the fact that [ServerRequest.php#L251](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/3.next/src/Http/ServerRequest.php#L251) clearly states:\r\n\r\n>`input` The data that would come from php://input this is useful for simulating requests with put, patch or delete data.\r\n\r\n### It works in\r\n\r\nTested it with version 3.3.11, and in that version nothing is wrong. `$this->request->input()` returns exactly what I expect.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n\r\nI don't know. `file_get_contents()` wrapped around it? Or, I have no idea what is best practice in this case.\r\n\r\nAlso, after the hint from hmic and Neon1024 I did some unit testing. But I didn't seem to find any tests that actually tested this. So, maybe there is a step to make there as well?","closed_by":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/9975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/9975/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
