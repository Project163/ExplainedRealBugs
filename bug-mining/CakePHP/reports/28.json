is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.4.13.\r\n* Platform and Target: nginx/1.13.4 , MariaDB/10.1.26, php7.0-fpm/7.0.19-1\r\n### What you did\r\nPassing an array of class attributes to a Form field results in a warning in `\\Cake\\View\\Helper.php:183` when the field has an error state, where `Helper::addClass(array $options = [], $class = null, $key = 'class')` is not designed to handle an array of class attributes in the `$option` parameter.\r\n\r\nThe following results in a trim warning when a modelless form is validated in the controller method.\r\n```\r\n/* template.ctp */\r\n<?= $this->Form->password('new_password', ['class' => ['form-control']]) ?>\r\n\r\n/* Controller.php */\r\n$modellessForm->validate($this->request->getData())\r\n```\r\n### What happened\r\nWarning displayed where a parameter passed to trim `trim` was array.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nInternally, element gets added to array of classes.\r\nExternally, no trim warning.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
