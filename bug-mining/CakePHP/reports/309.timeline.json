The main reason seems to be that in this case, the 3rd arg is set with this array instead as $context instead of the expected $regex\n\nThat's the case. `Validator::decimal()` uses only 1 argument with config like `'rule' => ['decimal', $places]`. Then because of `$args = array_values(array_merge([$value], $this->_pass, [$context]));` in `ValidationRule::process()` the context array gets passed as value for the 2nd argument `$regex` of `Validation::decimal()`.\n\nSo with the current implementation if a validation method has additional args you must either pass all the args or none to avoid this error. I can't think of any other way besides reflection to avoid this problem.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/2435811464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/2435890521","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17631#issuecomment-2435890521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17631","id":2435890521,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAoEbs6RML1Z","user":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-24T17:17:04Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T17:20:23Z","body":"I

rule is\n```php\n\t\t\t$validator->add('captcha_result', [\n\t\t\t\t'maxPerUser' => [\n\t\t\t\t\t'rule' => 'validateCaptchaMaxPerUser',\n\t\t\t\t\t'provider' => 'table',\n\t\t\t\t\t'message' => __d('captcha', 'Limit reached. Please retry later'),\n\t\t\t\t\t'last' => true,\n\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t]);\n```\nand the method for it inside the Table class:\n```php\n\tpublic function validateCaptchaMaxPerUser($value, $context) {\n\t\t// If no id was provided, the captcha was dummy due to MaxRule failure\n\t\treturn !empty($context['data']['captcha_id']);\n\t}\n```\n\nThis is a regression as before 5.0/5.1 this was working fine.\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n5.2\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
