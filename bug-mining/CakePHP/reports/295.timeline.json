#17261 we reversed the connection aliasing behavior so that if you had both a test and non test connection defined, and used the `test_` prefixed names in fixtures your local development database would be truncated.\r\n\r\nThe logic historically was that the framework would require you to define test_ prefixed connections and aliases would be made from live -> test so that accessing the live connection would retrieve the test connections. Having test prefixed connection names resolve to the real connection makes it hard to maintain a persistent development environment.\r\n\r\nFixes #17619","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12163355674,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAoEbs6B2O-BzwAAAALU_hQa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/12163355674","actor":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-19T04:24:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12226527641,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAoEbs6B2O-BzwAAAALYwgGZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/12226527641","actor":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f30bddafe60766cd6ca403462f56f3afdcc095be","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/commits/f30bddafe60766cd6ca403462f56f3afdcc095be","created_at":"2024-03-24T12:42:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
