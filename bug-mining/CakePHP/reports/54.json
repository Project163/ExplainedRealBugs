I think they did already in previous versions but the phpdoc was not up to date.\r\nNow my IDE is reminding me at each usage that I need to handle the exceptions from ``__('singular')``. \r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nWhile this reminding is indeed a problem related to my IDE, I think the exception handling should be done somewhere in ``i18n\\I18n.php`` ``getTranslator()`` (https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/I18n/I18n.php#L201). Because it wouldn't be a solution to surround each call to ``__('singular')`` with a ``try/catch`` neither to do really this exception handling in my application.","closed_by":{"login":"lorenzo","id":37621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
