is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.6.14.\r\n* Platform and Target: PHP 7.2.12, PHPStan 0.10.6.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nMy code contains a simple `$this->viewBuilder()->setClassName(null);` in a controller to not render a view. \r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nPHPStan emits an error `Parameter #1 $name of method Cake\\View\\ViewBuilder::setClassName() expects string, null given.`\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nNo error to be emitted since the `ViewBuilder->$_className` is declared as `@var string|null` the docblock for `ViewBuilder::setName($name)` should be updated with `@param string|null $name The name of the view.`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
