is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.1.5\r\n* Platform and Target: linux x64\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nI wanted to try out a different PHP version than the one installed system-wide, compiled it and ran\r\n\r\n    $ PHP=/path/to/my/own/cli/php bin/cake server\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThe bin/cake script was running with the PHP version I compiled locally, but the server it starts with `php -S` runs with the system-wide installed PHP version.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expected the ServerCommand.php script to also check for the PHP environment variable like the bin/cake script and use the PHP path provided in it if available, else fall back to the system-wide PHP installation\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is in [ServerCommand.php:130](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/Command/ServerCommand.php#L130)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
