Description\n\nHi !\nCurrently doing something like this on cakephp it is not so easy because **js path is dynamic**:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n    {\n          \"imports\": {\n            \"ckeditor5\": \"./ckeditor5/ckeditor5/ckeditor5.js\",\n            \"ckeditor5_utils\": \"./ckeditor5/ckeditor5_utils.js\"\n          }\n    }\n</script>\n```\n\nA new method on Html Helper would be very useful, something like:\n\n```php\nfunction createImportMap(array $hashmap, \\Cake\\View\\Helper\\HtmlHelper $htmlHelper, \\Cake\\View\\Helper\\UrlHelper $urlHelper): string\n{\n    $importMap = ['imports' => []];\n\n    foreach ($hashmap as $module => $path) {\n        // Generate a full URL for the script path\n        $url = $urlHelper->script($path, ['fullBase' => true]);\n        $importMap['imports'][$module] = $url;\n    }\n\n    // Convert the importmap to JSON\n    $importmapJson = json_encode($importMap, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT | JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES);\n\n    // Return the script block with defer\n    return $htmlHelper->scriptBlock($importmapJson, ['type' => 'importmap']);\n}\n\n// Example usage within a CakePHP view\n$hashmap = [\n    'ckeditor5' => 'ckeditor5/ckeditor5/ckeditor5.js',\n    'ckeditor5_utils' => 'ckeditor5/ckeditor5_utils.js',\n];\n\n// Generate and echo the importmap script block\necho createImportMap($hashmap, $this->Html, $this->Url);\n```\n\nMore about importmap: [](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)\n\nThanks in advance !\nCelso\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n_No
