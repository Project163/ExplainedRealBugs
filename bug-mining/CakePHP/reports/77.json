is a (multiple allowed):\r\n* [x] bug\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.7.5.\r\n* Platform and Target: Linux CLI.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nAttempting to use the Table Helper to output info containing styled text.\r\n```\r\n$io->helper('Table')->output([\r\n  ['Test', 'Status'],\r\n  ['PHP Version > 7.1.0', '<success>passed</success>']\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n### What happened\r\nThe table is rendered with the header row width calculated including the style tags. However, the data row is rendered with the actual width of the output string. Something like this:\r\n<pre>\r\n+----------------------------------------------------+\r\n| Test                     | Status                  |\r\n+--------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n|PHP Version > 7.1.0       | Passed |\r\n+--------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n<pre>\r\n+----------------------------------------------------+\r\n| Test                     | Status                  |\r\n+--------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n|PHP Version > 7.1.0       | Passed                  |\r\n+--------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n</pre>\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
