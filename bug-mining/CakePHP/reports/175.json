is a:\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.1.3\r\n* Platform and Target: NGINX, mySQL, php7.4.7 in a docker-container\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nUsing the form-helper, I created a time-field ([https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/views/helpers/form.html#creating-time-controls](https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/views/helpers/form.html#creating-time-controls)).\r\nValidation setting: \r\n```\r\n$validator\r\n    ->time('departuretime')\r\n    ->requirePresence('departuretime', 'create')\r\n    ->notEmptyTime('departuretime');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nWhen entering a time-value without seconds (i.e. 18:45), no time-value is patched into the entity. No validation-error is beeing shown. When I leave the time-field empty, the validation-error shows up. In the request-data-Array the time-value is shown.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    'name' => 'Test',\r\n'departuretime' => '18:00',\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the entity the departuretime is missing.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expected the time-value beeing converted into a time-instance and saved to the database. When I manually alter the time-value in a beforeMarshal()-function in my model (i.e. 18:45:00) or create a time instance everything works out fine.\r\n```\r\npublic function beforeMarshal(EventInterface $event, ArrayObject $data, ArrayObject $options)\r\n    {\r\n        if ($data['departuretime']) {\r\n             // creating time-instance\r\n              $data['departuretime'] = new FrozenTime($data['departuretime']);\r\n             // setting time-format manually\r\n              $data['departuretime'] = '18:45:00';\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14957/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
