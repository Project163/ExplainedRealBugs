is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.6.11\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nIn routes.php:\r\n```PHP\r\n$routes->scope('/packagePrice',['controller'=>'Checkout','action'=>'packagePrice'],function (RouteBuilder $routes) {\r\n\t$routes->connect('/shared', ['dynamic_package_type'=>'shared']);\r\n\t$routes->connect('/exclusive', ['dynamic_package_type'=>'exclusive']);\r\n\t$routes->connect('/geo', ['dynamic_package_type'=>'geo']);\r\n\t$routes->connect('/:id', [], ['id'=>'[0-9]*']);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n### What happened\r\nI get following error:\r\n```\r\nBadMethodCallException\r\nYou cannot define routes that conflict with the scope.\r\nScope had action = packagePrice, while route had action = index\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nSince ```action``` key is already defined inside ```scope```, ```connect``` method should not try to override it with ```['action'=>'index']``` which causes error\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12535/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
