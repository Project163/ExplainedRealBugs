Description\r\n\r\nIn my routes.php I have a route like this one:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$builder->connect('/articles/{slug}', ['controller' => 'Articles', 'action' => 'view'])->setPass(['slug']);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the `->setPass(['slug'])` the slug is listed twice in `$this->getRequest()->getAttribute('params');` which is the desired behaviour, i guess:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[slug] => testslug\r\n[pass] => Array\r\n(\r\n    [0] => testslug\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this causes problems when using `Router::reverse($this->getRequest()->getAttribute('params'))`, because the router class says that no route is matching. When i change my aforementioned route to ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n$builder->connect('/articles/{slug}/*', ['controller' => 'Articles', 'action' => 'view'])->setPass(['slug']);\r\n```\r\n\r\n... it creates the route `/articles/testslug/testslug`. So i think `Router::reverse()` or actually the underlying `Router::reverseToArray()` needs to handle things a little differently when using `->setPass()` when defining a route.\r\n\r\nSame behaviour in CakePHP 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n### CakePHP Version\r\n\r\n3.9.6 AND 4.3.1\r\n\r\n### PHP Version\r\n\r\n7.4","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16119/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
