Description\n\nI'm trying to create a command that imports some entities from one partner to another. Therefore I needed to add 2 arguments: a \"from-partner-id\" and a \"to-partner-id\" which would have the same usage/choices array. Here's that part of the code:\r\n```php\r\n$parser->addArgument('from-partner-id', [\r\n    'required' => true,\r\n    'help' => 'The partner id from which we import the data',\r\n    'choices' => array_map(function (Partner $partner) {\r\n        return \"$partner->id\";\r\n    }, $partners),\r\n]);\r\n$parser->addArgument('to-partner-id', [\r\n    'required' => true,\r\n    'help' => 'The partner id to which we import the data',\r\n    'choices' => array_map(function (Partner $partner) {\r\n        return \"$partner->id\";\r\n    }, $partners),\r\n]);\r\n```\r\nWhenever I am running this command it tells me I only have 1 argument defined even though I defined 2 of them. The issue is with this line: https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/4.x/src/Console/ConsoleInputArgument.php#L99 which is used here https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/4.x/src/Console/ConsoleOptionParser.php#L503\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.3.5\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.1","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/16715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
