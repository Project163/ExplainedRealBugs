agree @markstory , because thus updating CakePHP, everyone gets this fix. But I also had another similar problem. When using a theme, I can not create a custom layout and views within the theme, as the initializer of ErrorController overrides the initializer of the AppController which is responsible for changing the theme in my case. (This can be easily fixed in my project, but we are talking about an improvement for everyone.)\r\nI suggest debating a solid solution to this problem, making the error layouts and views as easily customizable as all other parts of the framework, which we call **automagic** =D.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I suggest that by default, if the error happened on a page that uses theme and/or prefix, CakePHP first checks to see if there is a layout and view error files for that prefix or theme. If it does not exist, it loads the defaults. If it is a theme being applied over a route with a prefix, it first checks if there are files in the theme, if it does not exist, check in the prefix and if it does not exist use the default. I think that would be pretty solid.
