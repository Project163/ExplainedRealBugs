Description\n\nThe doc claims it was added support for geospatial DB columns of type **linestring**, **polygon** and **geometry**.\n\nThe problem is that those column types are actually mapped somehow in the code BUT the respective classes are not present in folder `“src/Database/Type”`.\n\nThat means that a DB table, in which you have a GEOMETRY type field, worked fine in CakePHP 5.0.8 and now throws an error “unknown type “geometry” when marshaller is trying to build the respective type.\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n5.1.1\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.3.7","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
