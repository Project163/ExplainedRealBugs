BaseApplication::handle() is run when the middleware queue is exhausted, \r\n\r\nI was thinking it could be done in `handle()`. You're right that it would be too late for errors from middleware though. Wouldn't the request stored in `RoutingMiddleware` be too 'early' though? Any middleware in the stack can modify the request and pass the modified request to the 'next' layer and we don't have a way to get the most recent request modifications until we get to a checkpoint like `BaseApplication::handle()` or in `RoutingMiddleware`.\r\n\r\nI don't think using `Router::getRequest()` is that big of a hack, it is a solution for immutable request objects + global shared state. We already use it in a few places and this scenario feels similar to the other places we're using `Router::getRequest()`.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/2212473220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13414466567,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAoEbs6OiwoxzwAAAAMfkIQH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/13414466567","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"327f97a19149e1fa0d2d2db7501ae94533ec8feb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/commits/327f97a19149e1fa0d2d2db7501ae94533ec8feb","created_at":"2024-07-07T16:29:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-07T16:30:27Z","updated_at":"2024-07-07T16:30:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17734","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17734/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17734/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17734/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/pull/17734","id":2394122984,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAoEbs50ncil","number":17734,"title":"Set
