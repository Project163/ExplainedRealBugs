original issue was reported from @nojimage)\n\nThis is a (multiple allowed):\n- [ ] bug\n- [x] enhancement\n- [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\n- CakePHP Version: 3.2.10 / 2.8.4\n- Platform and Target: non-related\n### What you did\n\nThrow an exception with a custom error code.\n\n``` php\n$this->response->httpCodes([\n   509 => 'Bandwidth Limit Exceeded',\n]);\n\nthrow new HttpException('We are sorry', 509);\n```\n### Expected Behavior\n\nGet an error page with http code 509.\n### Actual Behavior\n\nGet an error page with http code 500. \nBecause ExceptionRenderer [only allows HTTP codes within range 400 to 506](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/2224d73f86ff6a13e7bb276791a1651089d60170/src/Error/ExceptionRenderer.php#L304-L308):\n\n``` php\n$errorCode = $exception->getCode();\nif ($errorCode >= 400 && $errorCode < 506) {\n    $code = $errorCode;\n}\nreturn $code;\n```\n\nBut I think it would be better to allow any status code if a caught exception is an instance of `HttpException`.\n### Solution\n\nChange the above to the following:\n\n``` php\n$errorCode = $exception->getCode();\nif ( $errorCode >= 400 && $errorCode < 506\n    || $exception instanceof HttpException && $this->controller->response->httpCodes($errorCode)\n) {\n    $code = $errorCode;\n}\nreturn $code;\n```\n\nDo you think this change is backward compatible?\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/8962/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/8962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
