The [IntegerType.php](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/Database/Type/IntegerType.php) has a small but really annoying bug that pops up occasionally in my application and it a pain to track down every time. If you pass a UUID to query conditions where the field is an integer the `IntegerType` will convert the UUID to an integer and return unexpected results. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// UsersTable.php\r\npublic function findUser(Query $query, array $options = []): Query\r\n{\r\n    return $query->where([\r\n        'OR' => [\r\n            [$this->aliasField('id') => $options['id']],\r\n            [$this->aliasField('uuid') => $options['id']],\r\n        ],\r\n    ]);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Using the finder\r\n$users = $this->Users->find('user', ['id' => '6a88accf-a34e-4dd9-ade0-8d255ccaecbe'])->toArray();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, I use `toArray()` to illustrate the point but `first()` would return the incorrect record as well. The following results are returned...\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$users = [\r\n    [\r\n        'id' => 6,\r\n        'uuid' => 'c52a67e7-87fa-408d-b819-ccb4033f7372',\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n        'id' => 213,\r\n        'uuid' => '6a88accf-a34e-4dd9-ade0-8d255ccaecbe',\r\n    ],\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a real example that has happened up at least 2 times in my application. What happens is when the UUID is [converted to an integer by php](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/Database/Type/IntegerType.php#L74) - if the UUID happens to begin with an integer - PHP is returning numeric values to until it reaches non-numeric values.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$uuid = '6a88accf-a34e-4dd9-ade0-8d255ccaecbe';\r\n(int)$uuid === 6; // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes application code to return very unexpected results. It's actually so obscure that it makes writing a test to check for it very difficult, too. The first time it popped up I just fixed it and moved on, but it is starting to happen more when I want to use `id` and `uuid` interchangeably.\r\n\r\nI haven't experienced it with any of the other database types, but I imagine this bug might present itself wherever a cast is being performed. For example using `on` or `off` in the `BoolType` could be caught with `filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN)`.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else has this problem, hopefully you've used a finder because the solution can be a little verbose. Alternatively, you can extend the `IntegerType` and patch it yourself.\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function findUser(Query $query, array $options = []): Query\r\n{\r\n    $conditions = [];\r\n\r\n    foreach ((array)$options['id'] as $id) {\r\n        $field = (is_numeric($id) === true) ? 'id' : 'uuid';\r\n        $conditions[] = [$this->aliasField($field) => $id];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return $query->where(['OR' => $conditions]);\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
