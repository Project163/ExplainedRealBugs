version 5.3 the method `Crud/Listener/ApiListener::respond` is changed to call `$response->withStatus` in stead of `$response->statusCode`. Because the actions View and Lookup don't have the key `api`, the status code in the Response is set to null. CakePHP doesn't check if null is a valid status code and add it to the response. This will result in a 502 bad gateway error in Nginx for example.\r\nThere is already a discussion going in cakephp/cakephp (https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11677), but it would be advisable
