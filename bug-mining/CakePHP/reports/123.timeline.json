I don't think 0 rows represents an invalid query unless you can select 0 fields, which you shouldn't be able to.  If there are no rows, then the conditions are excluding results which would exclude the association anyway.\r\n\r\nValidating on declaration would be impossible and writing something to validate before execution would be a large expression tree traversal.  I think validating results is the only possible solution.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/567341524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/567536054","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13467#issuecomment-567536054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13467","id":567536054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzUzNjA1NA==","user":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-19T15:27:13Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T15:27:13Z","body":"> Are you saying the PDO excludes nullable foreign key fields? \r\n\r\nNot in PDO, but when we are collecting foreign key values to prepare the conditions for the association query.

Validating in result generation is also difficult because of billable associations. I will explore how adding foreign keys would work. This wouldn't prevent fields being restricted after the contain() call unfortunately, but could help mitigate how frequently this comes up.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/567536054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/567590027","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13467#issuecomment-567590027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13467","id":567590027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzU5MDAyNw==","user":{"login":"andrii-pukhalevych","id":3767063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjcwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3767063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych","html_url":"https://github.com/andrii-pukhalevych","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrii-pukhalevych/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-19T17:41:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T17:41:45Z","body":"But foreign key is not null.
