is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.8.1.\r\n* Platform and Target: Apache, MySQL 5.6.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nSet float data type $fields in AreasFixture:\r\n```\r\n        'latitude' => [\r\n            'type' => 'float',\r\n            'length' => 53,\r\n            'precision' => 7,\r\n            'unsigned' => true,\r\n            'null' => true,\r\n            'default' => null,\r\n            'comment' => ''\r\n        ],\r\n        'longitude' => [\r\n            'type' => 'float',\r\n            'length' => 53,\r\n            'precision' => 7,\r\n            'unsigned' => true,\r\n            'null' => true,\r\n            'default' => null,\r\n            'comment' => ''\r\n        ],\r\n```\r\nWe use `double` data type in production database for that though.\r\n\r\nAdded to $fields in AreasFixture:\r\n```\r\n            [\r\n                'id' => 5,\r\n                'name' => 'My area',\r\n                'latitude' => 55.6760968,\r\n                'longitude' => 12.5683371,\r\n            ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nWrote unit test in AreasTableTest.php:\r\n```\r\n    public function testGet()\r\n    {\r\n        $expected = [\r\n            'id' => 5,\r\n            'name' => 'My area',\r\n            'latitude' => 55.6760968,\r\n            'longitude' => 12.5683371,\r\n        ];\r\n        $actual = $this->Areas->get(5)->toArray();\r\n        $this->assertEquals($expected, $actual);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I run `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/TestCase/Model/Table/AreasTableTest.php`.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThe test failed:\r\n```\r\n1) App\\Test\\TestCase\\Model\\Table\\AreasTableTest::testGet\r\nFailed asserting that two arrays are equal.\r\n--- Expected\r\n+++ Actual\r\n@@ @@\r\n-    'latitude' => 55.6760968\r\n-    'longitude' => 12.5683371\r\n+    'latitude' => 55.6760979\r\n+    'longitude' => 12.5683374\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI would expect the test to pass.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
