If one uses `authors` instead of `Authors` in `contain()` the related record is now under property `Authors` instead of `author` and also it's an array instead of entity.\r\n\r\n```php\r\ndiff --git a/tests/TestCase/ORM/Association/BelongsToTest.php b/tests/TestCase/ORM/Association/BelongsToTest.php\r\nindex 3fe85b2229..6cc56e870f 100644\r\n--- a/tests/TestCase/ORM/Association/BelongsToTest.php\r\n+++ b/tests/TestCase/ORM/Association/BelongsToTest.php\r\n@@ -415,12 +415,12 @@ class BelongsToTest extends TestCase\r\n         $query = $articles->find()\r\n             ->select(['Authors.name'])\r\n             ->where(['Articles.id' => 1])\r\n-            ->contain('Authors');\r\n+            ->contain('authors');\r\n         $result = $query->firstOrFail();\r\n \r\n-        $this->assertNotEmpty($result->author);\r\n-        $this->assertSame('mariano', $result->author->name);\r\n-        $this->assertSame(['author'], array_keys($result->toArray()), 'No other properties included.');\r\n+        $this->assertNotEmpty($result->Authors);\r\n+        $this->assertSame('mariano', $result->Authors['name']);\r\n+        $this->assertSame(['Authors'], array_keys($result->toArray()), 'No other properties included.');\r\n     }\r\n \r\n     /**\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The cause\r\nThe source of the problem is that all methods of `AssociationCollection` lower case the association names.\r\n\r\n### The solution\r\nRemove the lower casing of assocation names/aliases. That would cause the ORM to throw exception with message like `\"The authors association is not defined on Articles.\"` so users are made aware of the problem and they can fix it.","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14554/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14554/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
