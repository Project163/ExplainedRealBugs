like this issue was caused by changes in #11978. The `ExceptionRenderer` is now passed the request instead of it being retrieved from `Router` via `getRequest(true)` as it was in 3.6.\r\n\r\nBecause your request is using a `.json` extension the request that ends up in `ExceptionRenderer` doesn't have routing applied and the parsed extension is not present. The same problem does not occur if a request is sent with `Accept: application/json` in the headers.
