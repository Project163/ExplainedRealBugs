The tests fail because the ``I18n::locale()`` function behaves slightly different now.\r\n\r\nThe relevant changes can be seen in this commit:\r\nhttps://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/de23e33c44ca7a2cc3f7636b303f48966be222a9#diff-f93c69a473b7c4e871355ef04e668140L214\r\n\r\nIn the \"old\" version (3.4), when calling ``I18n::locale()`` we first get the default locale, before doing anything else, setting the variable ``$_defaultLocale`` to whatever the default was (en_US in my case because I didn't set any other default). Then we can do whatever we want (e.g. set a new locale) but ``$_defaultLocale`` will always be the very first locale (en_US in my case) and ``getDefaultLocale()`` will always return exactly that. That is also what the documentation of ``getDefaultLocale()`` says: \"This returns the default locale before any modifications\" https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/I18n/I18n.php#L332\r\n\r\nBut in 3.5, we don't call ``getDefaultLocale()`` (or ``defaultLocale()``) anymore when setting a new locale (it doesn't matter if you call ``setLocale()`` directly or if you call ``locale()``), meaning the 'default locale' gets lost. Since ``setLocale()`` overwrites the default locale on \"php level\" in intl https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/I18n/I18n.php#L292 and ``getDefaultLocale()`` reads the default locale from intl https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/I18n/I18n.php#L341, when we first use ``getDefaultLocale()``, ``getLocale()`` or ``locale()`` without parameter, the value that, at this point, has last been set will be set as default locale and it will stay that value from then on.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
