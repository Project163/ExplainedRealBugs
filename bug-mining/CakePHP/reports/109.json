Environment\r\nCakePHP 3.8.4\r\nPHP 7.2.19\r\nBake 1.11\r\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2017 (running in a Docker Container)\r\n\r\n# What I did\r\n`bin/bake fixture test_table`\r\n\r\nThis is the structure of the test case table:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE [dbo].[test_table](\r\n\t[id] [int] NOT NULL,\r\n\t[bin_field] [varbinary](max) NOT NULL,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# What Happened\r\n\r\nThis generates a fixture with the following line:\r\n`'bin_field' => ['type' => 'binary', 'length' => -1, 'null' => false, 'default' => null, 'precision' => null, 'comment' => null],`\r\n\r\nIn a test case, the SQL being generated is as follows:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE [test_table] (\r\n    [id] INTEGER NOT NULL,\r\n    [bin_field] VARBINARY(-1) NOT NULL\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **length => -1** is causing the invalid SQL error. However, if you actually specify the length of a number that is not MAX, it generates the SQL correctly. For example, VARBINARY(100) generates the following, which is correct:\r\n`'bin_field' => ['type' => 'binary', 'length' => 100, 'null' => false, 'default' => null, 'precision' => null, 'comment' => null],`\r\n\r\nSQL:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE [test_table] (\r\n    [id] INTEGER NOT NULL,\r\n    [bin_field] VARBINARY(100) NOT NULL\r\n)\r\n```\r\nPossible that \"-1\" in this case can be interpreted as MAX by the SQL generator for MSSQL?\r\n\r\nVARBINARY(MAX) stores a max file size of 2GB according to SQL Server documentation.  While ideally I'd love to not have this field even exist in the database itself, currently I am coding against a legacy database system and reworking this field is not possible in the scope of my project.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen this issue reported anywhere, so I thought I'd post here.
