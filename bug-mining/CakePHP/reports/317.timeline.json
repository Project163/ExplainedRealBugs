' - ' . $Article->subtitle;\n\n// For `Post`, by default no property is required.\n// But in this statement I expect `title` to be.\n// This will only throw an exception if `title` is not present, while `subtitle` is irrelevant to me\n$Post = new Post();\n$Post->requireFieldPresence(false);\necho $Post->getOrFail('title') . ($Post->subtitle ? ' - ' . $Post->subtitle : '');\n```\n\nOr, if we want, we could also intervene on the `get()` method [here](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/5.x/src/Datasource/EntityTrait.php#L336).\n\nImagining (just imagining, just to understand) that you could add an argument `$required` to the `get()` method:\n\n```php\npublic function &get(string $field, bool $required = false): mixed\n{\n   /// ...\n\n   if (!$fieldIsPresent && ($this->requireFieldPresence || $required)) {\n     /// ...\n   }\n\n   /// ...\n}\n```\nSo the previous example:\n\n```php\n// For `Post`, by default no property is required.\n// But in this statement I expect `title` to be.\n// This will only throw an exception if `title` is not present, while `subtitle` is irrelevant to me\n$Post = new Post();\n$Post->requireFieldPresence(false);\necho $Post->get('title', true) . ($Post->subtitle ? ' - ' . $Post->subtitle : '');\n```\n\nIt's just to throw out an idea that maybe you might like.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/2621598347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mirko-pagliai","id":293199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzE5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/293199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai","html_url":"https://github.com/mirko-pagliai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirko-pagliai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16107877965,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAoEbs6n8FoszwAAAAPAGrZN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/16107877965","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7d146be3ca6f06acf4a8bc41e1879b4b25ffeaef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/commits/7d146be3ca6f06acf4a8bc41e1879b4b25ffeaef","created_at":"2025-01-29T13:15:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/2621959619","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18164#issuecomment-2621959619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18164","id":2621959619,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAoEbs6cR-3D","user":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-29T15:24:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T15:24:10Z","body":"Having a `getOrFail()` does sound interesting.
