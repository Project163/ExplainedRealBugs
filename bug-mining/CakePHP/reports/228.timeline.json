I was able to reproduce the problem you're seeing and the difference between 3.x and 4.x was introduced quite recently as a consequence of fixing #15977 (another long dormant bug). In this issue the reporter *has* a junction table instance.\r\n\r\nThe reporter of #15977 expects  (I agree with their view) that the query used to delete records on the junction table, should receive junction table entity instances in callbacks. As the query that that creates entities for callbacks is the *same* as the one that association finders are applied to.\r\n\r\nCurrently we call the BelongsToMany `finder` option on the target table and *then* pass that finder the query currently based on the junction table. This change in behavior has cause finders that use `contain()` to break as you've described.\r\n\r\nOne potential solution that *could* work is to revert most of the changes in #15985 and after the finder and conditions are built we can use that in a subquery select from the junction record table. This should let us get the correct entity type with all the required columns and have all the conditions driven by the subquery. This would require applying additional subquery conditions so that the joins to the junction table work, but we can do that with the ORM now. How does that sound as a solution to you? \r\n\r\ncc @cakephp/core
