Description\n\n**The issue**\n\nWhile upgrading from v4 to v5 we noticed an issue with the configuration `App.base`. It gets ignored when generating URLs on the CLI.\n\n**How to reproduce**\n\nSet the configurarion `App.base` to '/foo'.\n\nCreate an url within a cake command as follow:\n`Router::url('/bar', true)`\n\nThe url generated should be http://my-domainl.com/foo/bar. \n\nBut the base is simply ignored.\n\n**How to fix**\n\nI suspect this to have been introduced by [this commit](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/09dd93b3c60b4cdcc611f97ac891c50676870298).\n\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n5.0\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.2","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18629/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
