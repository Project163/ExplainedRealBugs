an email to `[\"my@customer.net\" => null]`\r\n- Wrote a test using the `EmailTrait`\r\n- Called `$this->assertEmailSentTo('my@customer.net');`\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThe assertion failed.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nThe assertion should have succeeded\r\n\r\n### Why did that happen?\r\nThe `MailSentWith` constraint uses `isset($value[$other])` to check the assertion. this fails for existing array keys with a null value. `array_key_exists($other, $value)` should do the job.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.php.net/manual/de/function.array-key-exists.php#example-6219","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
