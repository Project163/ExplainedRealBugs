is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: latest master\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nUpgrade cake3 app to cake4\r\n\r\nURL `/clubs/users` without any args.\r\n```php\r\n\tpublic $paginate = ['order' => ['Clubs.name' => 'ASC']];\r\n\r\n\t// ClubController users action\r\n\t$query = $this->Clubs->ClubUsers->find();\r\n\t$clubUsers = $this->paginate($query)->toArray();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\n```\r\n[TypeError] strtolower() expects parameter 1 to be string, bool given in\r\n /var/www/site/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/View/Helper/PaginatorHelper.php on line 566\r\n```\r\n\r\nI solved it on project level for now using\r\n```php\r\n\t\t// HACK FOR NOW\r\n\t\tif ($this->request->getAttribute('paging') && $this->request->getAttribute('paging')['ClubUsers']['direction'] === false) {\r\n\t\t\t$paging = $this->request->getAttribute('paging');\r\n\t\t\t$paging['ClubUsers']['direction'] = 'asc';\r\n\t\t\t$this->request = $this->request->withAttribute('paging', $paging);\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nServerRequest content\r\n```\r\nprotected attributes => [\r\n'isAjax' => false,\r\n'paging' => [\r\n'ClubUsers' => [\r\n'count' => (int) 614,\r\n'current' => (int) 20,\r\n'perPage' => (int) 20,\r\n'page' => (int) 1,\r\n'requestedPage' => (int) 1,\r\n'pageCount' => (int) 31,\r\n'start' => (int) 1,\r\n'end' => (int) 20,\r\n'prevPage' => false,\r\n'nextPage' => true,\r\n'sort' => 'Clubs.name',\r\n'direction' => false, // !\r\n'sortDefault' => 'Clubs.name',\r\n'directionDefault' => 'ASC',\r\n'completeSort' => [ ],\r\n'limit' => null,\r\n'scope' => null,\r\n'finder' => 'all',\r\n],\r\n],\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n\r\nNo TypeError, either meaningful exception to dev, or defaulting to a sane default for direction (asc/desc etc).\r\n\r\nI assume there is some shenanigans going on inside the default whitelist validation for aliases models.\r\nWhich then, combined with a non-direct component paginate seems to not work with the model being used for sorting.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15499/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
