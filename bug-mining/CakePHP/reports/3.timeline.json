for the delay. I've had to learn how to use phpunit :)\n\n@markstory, I haven't seen any impact with the translated errors functionalities. \n\nThis solution is not very ellegant. I think error options in the input function should be separated in two different structures, to pass them separately to the error function as well, but it would break the backwards compatibility.\n\nbtw, I have a project running in 3.0 branch (current 3.0.18), will you merge the change on that branch too?\n\nThanks and

is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 2.10.16 (commit 4fd57b86ca2263ac39ed66a278cd1f058b6d550e)\r\n* Platform and Target: Apache2, MySQL\r\n\r\nIn a View I set the following:\r\n```\r\n\t\t$this->Form->inputDefaults( [\r\n\t\t\t'error' => [\r\n\t\t\t\t'attributes' => [ 'class' => 'my-error-class' ],\r\n\t\t\t\t'escape' => false,\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t]);\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe 'attributes' option is applied to all the generated inputs, but the 'escape' option never makes it to  FormHelper::error(). In my tests, the same happens when the 'error' option is specified when calling FormHelper::input();\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I change  how the error() method is called (around line 1069) from:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$errMsg` = $this->error($fieldName, $error);\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\n$errMsg = $this->error($fieldName, null, $error);\r\n```\r\n\r\nmy error message appears with HTML inside.\r\n\r\nHappy to submit a pull request...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13053/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
