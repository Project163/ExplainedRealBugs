Description\r\n\r\nFor 5.x I'd love to see TLS support for the Redis cache engine.\r\n\r\nWe're using Redis as cache (because Azure) for every project and in every project we have something like this included:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nnamespace Redis\\Cache\\Engine;\r\n\r\nclass RedistlsEngine extends \\Cake\\Cache\\Engine\\RedisEngine\r\n{\r\n    protected $_defaultConfig = [\r\n        'database' => 0,\r\n        'duration' => 3600,\r\n        'groups' => [],\r\n        'password' => false,\r\n        'persistent' => true,\r\n        'port' => 6380,\r\n        'prefix' => 'cake_',\r\n        'probability' => 100,\r\n        'host' => null,\r\n        'server' => '127.0.0.1',\r\n        'timeout' => 0,\r\n        'unix_socket' => false,\r\n        'scanCount' => 10,\r\n        'tls' => true\r\n    ];\r\n    \r\n    protected function _connect() : bool\r\n    {\r\n        if ($this->_config['tls'] === true) {\r\n            $this->_config['server'] = 'tls://' . $this->_config['server'];\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return parent::_connect();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a widely used framework I don't think this solution is the best. I can imagine use cases where you'll need to be able to add a CA certificate for example.\r\n\r\n### CakePHP Version\r\n5.0 with optional backport for 4.x","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
