Eg:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"form-group datetime\">\r\n  <label class=\"col-form-label\">Start Date</label>\r\n  <input name=\"start_date\" value=\"2018-03-19 17:00:00\" id=\"start-date\" type=\"hidden\">\r\n  <div class=\"input-group datetime \">\r\n    <!-- removed for clarity -->\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nThe `<label>` should contain the appropriate `for` attribute`, eg:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"form-group datetime\">\r\n  <label class=\"col-form-label\" for=\"start-date\">Start Date</label>\r\n  <input name=\"start_date\" value=\"2018-03-19 17:00:00\" id=\"start-date\" type=\"hidden\">\r\n  <div class=\"input-group datetime \">\r\n    <!-- removed for clarity -->\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/src/View/Helper/FormHelper.php#L1505 assumes that a `datetime` is in `$groupTypes` causing forceful set of `for` to `false`.\r\n\r\nThere's no way AFAIK to bypass this aside by overriding the whole `_inputLabel()` method. Ideally, this should be configurable or obtained from the widget.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
