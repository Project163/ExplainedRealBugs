The form being posted is not being created with the FormHelper.\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * blackhole\r\n     * @param string $type\r\n     * @return \\Cake\\Http\\Response\r\n     */\r\n    public function blackhole($type, \\Cake\\Controller\\Exception\\SecurityException $Exception)\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        if (!$this->Auth->user()) {\r\n            $this->Flash->error('You must login to continue.');\r\n            return $this->redirect('/users/login');\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        $this->Flash->error(\"You are not authorized to view this page.\");\r\n        return $this->redirect($this->referer());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nMy browser is redirected and i get the \"You are not authorized to view this page.\" flash error, which is correct. However, via debugging i can also see that the controller action is executed in full and i can see the new record inserted into the database.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI expected to be redirected and for the controller action to not be executed (due to the form tampering protection in SecurityComponent)\r\n\r\n### Extra Info\r\nI have noticed that if i modify the following lines in SecurityComponent::startup()\r\n```\r\n} catch (SecurityException $se) {\r\n     $this->blackHole($controller, $se->getType(), $se);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto\r\n ```\r\n} catch (SecurityException $se) {\r\n     return $this->blackHole($controller, $se->getType(), $se);     \r\n}\r\n```\r\nthis issue goes away.\r\n\r\nHere's my best understanding of what's happening: Since the response from the blackhole callback is not being returned, Cake\\Controller\\Controller::startupProcess() has no reason to return the redirect as a response, so it just moves forward with executing the controller action. The redirect then occurs at the end of the controller action that should have been black-holed. \r\nThe reason that the redirect is still occurring, despite the fact that the redirect was not returned correctly from the blackhole callback, was that \\Cake\\Controller\\Controller::redirect() had mutated the controller's response object, adding the location header.","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13036/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
