is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.8.1.\r\n* Platform and Target: Apache, MySQL 5.6.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nExecuted `bin/cake bake model Areas`.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nFew classes were generated but the length and precision in AreasFixture.php were wrong:\r\n```\r\n    public $fields = [\r\n        'id' => [\r\n            'type' => 'integer',\r\n            'length' => 10,\r\n            'unsigned' => true,\r\n            'null' => false,\r\n            'default' => null,\r\n            'comment' => '',\r\n            'autoIncrement' => true,\r\n            'precision' => null\r\n        ],\r\n        'name' => [\r\n            'type' => 'string',\r\n            'length' => 90,\r\n            'null' => false,\r\n            'default' => null,\r\n            'collate' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',\r\n            'comment' => '',\r\n            'precision' => null,\r\n            'fixed' => null\r\n        ],\r\n        'latitude' => [\r\n            'type' => 'float',\r\n            'length' => 0,\r\n            'precision' => 0,\r\n            'unsigned' => true,\r\n            'null' => true,\r\n            'default' => null,\r\n            'comment' => ''\r\n        ],\r\n        'longitude' => [\r\n            'type' => 'float',\r\n            'length' => 0,\r\n            'precision' => 0,\r\n            'unsigned' => true,\r\n            'null' => true,\r\n            'default' => null,\r\n            'comment' => ''\r\n        ],\r\n        '_constraints' => [\r\n            'primary' => [\r\n                'type' => 'primary',\r\n                'columns' => [\r\n                    'id'\r\n                ],\r\n                'length' => []\r\n            ],\r\n        ],\r\n        '_options' => [\r\n            'engine' => 'InnoDB',\r\n            'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci'\r\n        ]\r\n    ];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I run `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/TestCase/Model/Table/AreasTableTest.php` and got:\r\n```\r\nWarning Error: Fixture creation for \"areas\" failed \"SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1439 Display width out of range for column 'latitude' (max = 255)\" in [../vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/TestSuite/Fixture/TestFixture.php, line 313]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI would expect the length and the precision to be `null` or some numbers to correctly represent `double` data type.\r\n\r\nDDL:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE `areas` (\r\n  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n  `name` varchar(90) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\r\n  `latitude` double unsigned DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  `longitude` double unsigned DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci;\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/13697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
