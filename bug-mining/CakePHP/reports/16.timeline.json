Ok, so I figured out that, apparently, PHP approves when instances with the same classname call protected methods of each other. So that explains why it has never thrown an error, even in the test harnesses. The default translator retrieved from the registry is cached in `_cake_core_`. Which in .11 is Aura, but now is Cake's own I18n Translator. Therefore, it occurs that we get this:\r\n```\r\nobject(Cake\\I18n\\Translator) {\r\n\t[protected] fallback => object(Aura\\Intl\\Translator) {\r\n```\r\nThough, I still need to figure out why the Cake Translator is initialized with a fallback on Aura.\r\n\r\nBesides figuring out the exact cause, I also advocate that the TranslatorInterface in Aura should be adjusted, such that there is a

so the following goes wrong:\r\n- There is `PackageLocator` in Aura with a cached registry\r\n- There is `TranslatorLocator` in Aura with a cached registry\r\n- There is `TranslatorFactory` in Aura
