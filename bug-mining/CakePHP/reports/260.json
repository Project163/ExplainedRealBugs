Using a single instance of the Mailer class. The return value of getMessages() will be invalid if more than 1 email is sent.\r\n\r\nI believe this is because the $message object is a reference to the Mailer's single $message object, and all subsequent calls to setSubject, setTo, etc. will affect all messages in the static::messages array in TestEmailTransport.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        // Dummy Data\r\n        $event1 = ['title' => 'Event 1', 'eventdate' => '2023-02-23', 'time' => '18:00'];\r\n        $event2 = ['title' => 'Event 1', 'eventdate' => '2023-02-23', 'time' => '18:00'];\r\n        $emails = ['one@test.com' => $event1, 'two@example.org' => $event2];\r\n\r\n        // Create a new Mailer and configure it for all emails\r\n        $mailer = new Mailer();\r\n\r\n        $mailer\r\n            ->setTransport('default')\r\n            ->setEmailFormat('html')\r\n            ->setLayout('default');\r\n\r\n        foreach ($emails as $email => $event) {\r\n            $mailer\r\n                ->setSubject($event['title'])\r\n                ->setTo($email)\r\n                ->setViewVars(['title' => $event['title'], 'event' => $event])\r\n                ->deliver();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix for this is to update TestEmailTransport send() method so that it clones the $message object rather than stores the reference.\r\n\r\nE.G.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Stores email for later assertions\r\n     *\r\n     * @param \\Cake\\Mailer\\Message $message Message\r\n     * @return array{headers: string, message: string}\r\n     */\r\n    public function send(Message $message): array\r\n    {\r\n        static::$messages[] = clone $message;\r\n\r\n        return parent::send($message);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n4.4.11\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.2","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/17030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
