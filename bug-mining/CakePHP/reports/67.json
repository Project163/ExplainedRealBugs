is a (multiple allowed):\r\n\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 3.7.1 : 1f6fd21ca27ffc88fa88506a400b94a809e29254\r\n* Platform and Target: apache php 7.0.12\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nIn fresh cakephp 3.7.1 install, I create an API.\r\n\r\nIn my route.php\r\n```php\r\nRouter::scope('/', function (RouteBuilder $routes) {\r\n    $routes->setExtensions(['json']);\r\n\t//...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn AppController\r\n```php\r\npublic function initialize()\r\n    {\r\n        parent::initialize();\r\n\r\n        $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler', [\r\n            'enableBeforeRedirect' => false,\r\n        ]);\r\n        $this->loadComponent('Flash');\r\n\r\n        /*\r\n         * Enable the following

TestController extends AppController\r\n{\r\n    public function success()\r\n    {\r\n        $this->set([\r\n            'test' => true,\r\n            '_serialize' => ['test']\r\n        ]);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function error()\r\n    {\r\n        throw new NotFoundException();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA simple view for test\r\n```\r\n<script>\r\n    fetch('/Test/error.json')\r\n    fetch('/Test/success.json')\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\n* /Test/success.json\r\n![success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5025797/50347527-1e864680-0536-11e9-89a7-9a5a0bf473a5.png)\r\n\r\n*
