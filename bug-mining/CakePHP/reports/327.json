Description\n\nSince upgrading to 5.2.0 (and also patch 5.2.1) upon editing an entity via a form & `patchEntity()` all magic `_set()` mutators run even when the field is not dirty. The setter did not previously run when no changes had been passed in `patchEntity()` this is a big behaviour change that is not mentioned in the migration guide that i feel is an unexpected behaviour.\n\nI see there were fixes for loss of context in 5.2.1 \n\n_Fixed regression where custom validation methods would have not get `$context` passed._\n\nCould this be related and a similar issue?  \n\n### CakePHP Version\n\n5.2.1\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.3.14","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
