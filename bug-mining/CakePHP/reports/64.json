latest, and while doing so I kept the middelware loading the same:\r\n\r\n\t->add(RoutingMiddleware::class);\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n$app going into the middleware is null (see https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/pull/12739).\r\nThis silently fallbacks to some weird thing where now no plugin routes are loaded anymore in Web requests. CLI works fine, though.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that this is not so bc after all, and as such dangerous to be kept silent.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nThat it still loads the plugin routes.\r\nOr maybe some deprecation warning here if `$app === null` to make it easier to know that it now requires the $app to be actually passed as object to load plugin routing.\r\n\r\nAs\r\n\r\n\t->add(new RoutingMiddleware($this, '_cake_routes_'))\r\n\r\nfixes the issue","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/12740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
