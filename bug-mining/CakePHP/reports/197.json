is a (multiple allowed):\r\n* [x] bug\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.2.4.\r\n* Platform and Target: Ubuntu Linux 18.04, PHP 7.2.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nI've set up a plugin with a namePrefix for its routes.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// my Plugin class\r\nclass Plugin extends BasePlugin\r\n{\r\n    public function routes(RouteBuilder $routes): void\r\n    {\r\n        $config = [\r\n            'path' => '/sadmin',\r\n            '_namePrefix' => 'sadmin.',\r\n        ];\r\n\r\n        $routes->plugin('SuperAdmin', $config, function (RouteBuilder $builder) {\r\n            $builder->connect('/', 'Clientes::index', ['_name' => 'home']);\r\n            $builder->fallbacks();\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        parent::routes($routes);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThe route is registered with the _name \"home\" without the prefix.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nThe route should be named as \"sadmin.home\"\r\n\r\nI've been looking into the code and I think the issue is on the `\\Cake\\Routing\\RouteBuilder::plugin()` method, as it's ignoring any options key other than `\"path\"`:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// \\Cake\\Routing\\RouteBuilder class\r\n    public function plugin(string $name, $options = [], $callback = null)\r\n    {\r\n        if (!is_array($options)) {\r\n            $callback = $options;\r\n            $options = [];\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        $params = ['plugin' => $name] + $this->_params;\r\n        $path = $options['path'] ?? '/' . Inflector::dasherize($name);\r\n        $this->scope($path, $params, $callback);\r\n\r\n        return $this;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, `$options` is not passed nor merged into `scope()` method, instead only the `\"path\"` key is taken.\r\nI found this bug some time ago, in cakephp 3.x, I was almost sure I'd reported it then, but it turns out that I didn't, I'd just used the scope method directly, avoiding the use of `plugin()`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
