NOCHECK CONSTRAINT all\"\r\nEXEC sp_msforeachtable \"ALTER TABLE ? WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT all\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nEven though my database collation is set to Case Insensitive, driver replies it can't find `sp_msforeachtable`.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nI had to replace with those statements to run the query:\r\n```sql\r\nEXEC sp_MSforeachtable \"ALTER TABLE ? NOCHECK CONSTRAINT all\"\r\nEXEC sp_MSforeachtable \"ALTER TABLE ? WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT all\"\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"othercorey","id":24221186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIxMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24221186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey","html_url":"https://github.com/othercorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othercorey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14432/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
