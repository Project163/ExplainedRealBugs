there,\r\n\r\nI have a problem when updating to Cake 4.3. \r\nWe are using „Fixture Factories 2.5.1“ and „test-suite-light 2.4“.\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nThe tables are not emptied between tests, since the triggers  are not created in the database.\r\nAfter some evaluation, the Sniffer’s truncateDirtyTables() method is called, but createTriggers() is not.\r\n\r\nWe are using a MariaDB database, so I used the MysqlTriggerBasedTableSniffer in my DB config.\r\n'tableSniffer' => '\\CakephpTestSuiteLight\\Sniffer\\MysqlTriggerBasedTableSniffer',\r\n\r\nNote: I already had the problem on Cake 4.2 and before that the triggers were not created automatically.\r\nTherefore I had created the triggers manually on the database. That worked.\r\nWith the update, this workaround no longer works. \r\nThe triggers are now deleted when the test is executed, since the DB schema is created anew each time by the schema generator.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any help.\r\nThanks.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vierge-noire/cakephp-test-suite-light/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vierge-noire/cakephp-test-suite-light/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5772968947,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAoEbs4_Cqz0zwAAAAFYGIPz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/5772968947","actor":{"login":"rmarsh1ua","id":82287338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjg3MzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82287338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua","html_url":"https://github.com/rmarsh1ua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0cbd3e45e99654e16bbdf87543a07369f53ea635","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rmarsh1ua/cakephp/commits/0cbd3e45e99654e16bbdf87543a07369f53ea635","created_at":"2021-12-15T17:32:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5774780997,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAoEbs4_Cqz0zwAAAAFYNCpF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/5774780997","actor":{"login":"rmarsh1ua","id":82287338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjg3MzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82287338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua","html_url":"https://github.com/rmarsh1ua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmarsh1ua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2764183b0711143b8bf1e1d0d14da2bfb3a9cf96","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rmarsh1ua/cakephp/commits/2764183b0711143b8bf1e1d0d14da2bfb3a9cf96","created_at":"2021-12-15T22:53:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5785556033,"node_id":"DEME_lADOAAoEbs4_Cqz0zwAAAAFY2JRB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/5785556033","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-17T16:08:51Z","milestone":{"title":"4.3.3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5785556035,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAAoEbs4_Cqz0zwAAAAFY2JRD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/events/5785556035","actor":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users
