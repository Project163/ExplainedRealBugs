Prior to commit https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/b6b75b0662d38889e5b699a8fe1c72f6e9022c02, rules added with RulesChecker:add() only applied to create and update operations.\n\nI am not sure that's a valid claim. Rules added with `RulesChecker:add()` apply to delete operations as well. The manual states the same https://book.cakephp.org/5/en/orm/validation.html#creating-a-rules-checker\n\n```\n    // Add a rule that is applied for create, update and delete operations\n    $rules->add(function ($entity, $options) {\n        // Return a boolean to indicate pass/failure\n    }, 'ruleName');\n```\n\nThe only change that the referenced commit does is use the rule name as array key when storing the rules (too allow removing rules by name), it doesn't change how the rules are run in anyway.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/3172373837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/comments/3172378076","html_url":"https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18800#issuecomment-3172378076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/18800","id":3172378076,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAoEbs69FqXc","user":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-10T05:18:09Z","updated_at":"2025-08-10T05:18:09Z","body":"Sorry,
