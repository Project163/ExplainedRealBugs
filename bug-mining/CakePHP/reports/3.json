is a (multiple allowed):\n- [x] bug\n- [ ] enhancement\n- [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\n- CakePHP Version: detected on 3.0.18, master also has it.\n- Platform and Target: not relevant\n### What you did\n\nI have a field \"vat_number\" which returns a validation message that contains HTML I don't want to be escaped, so I write:\n`<?= $this->Form->input('vat_number', ['error' => ['escape' => false]]) ?>`\nIt keeps escaping the HTML, but if I write directly:\n`<?= $this->Form->error('vat_number',null,['escape' => false]) ?>`\n... it works.\n### Expected Behavior\n\nValidation message is not escaped when you set the options from the input function of FormHelper.\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt keeps escaping the message.\n### Fix proposed\n\nThe fix is to change FormHelper 'cause it's not passing the parameters in the right order to the \"error\" function. Also if the \"error\" option is not passed it should be converted to an empty array.\n\n```\n...\n        if ($options['type'] !== 'hidden' && $options['error'] !== false) {\n            $options['error'] = isset($options['error']) ? $options['error'] : [];\n            $error = $this->error($fieldName, null, $options['error']);\n            $errorSuffix = empty($error) ? '' : 'Error';\n            unset($options['error']);\n        }\n...\n```\n\nI'm preparing a pull request.\n\nRegards,\nPedro.\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/8821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/8821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
