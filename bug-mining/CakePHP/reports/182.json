[x] bug\r\n\r\n* CakePHP Version: 4.1.5\r\n* Platform and Target: Any.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nI'm trying to make a post request with Oauth 1.0 authentication with an xml body. like this :\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$http = new Client();\r\n$response = $http->post('http://example.com/test', '<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><test></test>', [\r\n  'headers' => ['Content-Type' => 'text/xml'],\r\n  'auth' => [\r\n    'type' => 'oauth',\r\n    'consumerKey' => 'xxx',\r\n    'consumerSecret' => 'xxx',\r\n    'token' => 'xxx',\r\n    'tokenSecret' => 'xxx'\r\n  ]\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nEverything works fine except that the signature generated is wrong. Cakephp uses the request body to generate it when it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\n**Section 9.1.1 of Oauth spec (https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#anchor13) :**\r\n\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3149449/96109067-94635b00-0ede-11eb-9b10-3bc14cf7c00d.PNG)\r\n\r\nI'm expecting for cakephp dont use the body of the request to generate the Oauth Authorization when it shouldn't do it :)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markstory","id":24086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory","html_url":"https://github.com/markstory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markstory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/15066/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
