Place a `return` in front of the statement, and you get 502 Bad Gateway errors.\r\n```\r\n$this->Crud->mapAction('someWorkingMethod', 'Crud.View');\r\n$this->Crud->mapAction('someBrokenMethod', 'Crud.View');\r\n\r\n//working\r\npublic function someWorkingMethod() {\r\n    $this->Crud->execute();\r\n}\r\n\r\n// crashing\r\npublic function someBrokenMethod() {\r\n    return $this->Crud->execute();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nThrough some digging, we found the statuscode in the response is null, gets transformed to 0 and nginx loses it. The statuscode being null originates from the ViewAction missing an index `api` in its defaultConfig. We encountered this problem after we updated to Crud 5.3, which now uses `$response->withStatus()` instead of `$response->statusCode()`. `withStatus()` does not check the provided status, which `statusCode` did.\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nWe expected our methods to simply return the response, instead of completely crashing. The statuscode should never become null.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/11677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
