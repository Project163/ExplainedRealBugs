did\r\nI tried to use a layout with *.ctp extension\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\nMissingLayoutExtension asks to create a template on wrong folder:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10481749/84544602-849bf600-acf5-11ea-874d-7dbf2a9af5e9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What you expected to happen\r\nThe help text should say `/templates/layout/layout_name.php` instead of `/templates/layout_name.php`.\r\nAlso, it could be a good idea to mark the extension in bold or something.\r\nI struggled finding what was happening since I use with CakePHP 1, 2 and 3 (*.ctp) at work.","closed_by":{"login":"dereuromark","id":39854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark","html_url":"https://github.com/dereuromark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dereuromark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cakephp/cakephp/issues/14704/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
