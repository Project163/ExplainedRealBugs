 | `--fail-on-flaky-tests` | Fails test runs that contain flaky tests. By default flaky tests count as successes. |
 | `--forbid-only` | Whether to disallow `test.only`. Useful on CI.|
 | `--global-timeout <number>` | Total timeout for the whole test run in milliseconds. By default, there is no global timeout. Learn more about [various timeouts](./test-timeouts.md).|
-| `-g <grep>` or `--grep <grep>` | Only run tests matching this regular expression. For example, this will run `'should add to cart'` when passed `-g "add to cart"`.  The regular expression will be tested against the string that consists of the test file name, `test.describe` titles if any, test title and all test tags, separated by spaces, e.g. `my-test.spec.ts my-suite my-test @smoke`. The filter does not apply to the tests from dependency projects, i.e. Playwright will still run all tests from [project dependencies](./test-projects.md#dependencies). |

 | `--grep-invert <grep>` | Only run tests **not** matching this regular expression. The opposite of `--grep`. The filter does not apply to the tests from dependency projects, i.e. Playwright will still run all tests from [project dependencies](./test-projects.md#dependencies).|
 | `--headed` | Run tests in headed browsers. Useful for debugging. |
 | `--ignore-snapshots` | Whether to ignore [snapshots](./test-snapshots.md). Use this when snapshot expectations are known to be different, e.g. running tests on Linux against Windows screenshots. |
