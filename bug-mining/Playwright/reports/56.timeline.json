In VS Code with the PW Plugin installed.,  Create/open an empty folder.\r\n2. VS Codes command pallet and  Install: Playwright\r\n3. Look at Test Explorer, ensure the stock sample project was installed, should see in the test explorer \"get started link\"\r\n4. open the terminal in VS Code and run, first few work then...\r\n5. npx playwright test \"get started link\" \r\n    Running 1 test using 1 worker\r\n      [1/1] [firefox] › example.spec.ts:10:5 › get started link\r\n     **(works as expected.)** \r\n\r\n7. npx playwright test --grep \"get.+link\" \r\n      [1/1] [firefox] › example.spec.ts:10:5 › get started link\r\n     **(works as expected.)** \r\n\r\n-- Note the regex for begins with and ends with... \r\n8. npx playwright test --grep \"**^**get.+link**$**\" \r\n    **No tests found.**      \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nthe last command example in the repro steps should have worked... \n\n### Actual behavior\n\nNo tests are run when adding in regex meta characters for begins with it seems. \n\n### Additional context\n\nnone -- should be really straight forward... \r\n\r\nother than help has no docs on the \"Flavor of regex\" if unqualified all regex commands should be valid as is, and shouldn't be language specific.   Such as javascript might requires like the '//ig'  regex command format.   If required \"internal\" then one shouldn't need to enter them on the command line if always needed the plug in should add them...?   So:\r\nnpx playwright test --grep \"/<<regex pattern>>/ig\" seems unnecessary if --grep has already been entered? \r\n\r\nOn other note,  it seems this is related to when tag annotations, i swear i use to have batch files for running test and --grep worked exactly as expected,  not running them for a while i might bet the issue came in with overloading grep with tags.  Honestly it seem there should be a --grep only for tests titles, and --grepTag for searching tags and the two, however fancy one is trying to be, they should be completely separate.  What if i have s collision of a test title that might pick up tests with the tag  but wish only one to run...   With the test title and tags searched, not sure how to get so only one will run, or not include something not desired to run...   But i'd agree a separate issue, but just feels to me the grep functionality broke with the 'tag  functionality...'  So kind of related and something to consider this when fixing this...?\r\n\r\nFinally would assert **any** regex that works when references [www.regex101.com](url)  if it matches then it should work... \n\n### Environment\n\n```shell\nWin 10 \r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"sample\",\r\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\r\n  \"description\": \"\",\r\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {},\r\n
