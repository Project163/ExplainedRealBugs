happen?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-14T01:16:31Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T01:16:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28629","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28629/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28629/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28629/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/28629","id":2040423983,"node_id":"PR_kwDODTssw85h72Zr","number":28629,"title":"fix(dispatchers): separate gc bucket for main frame, increased limit","user":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2992174511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTkyMTc0NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/labels/CQ1","name":"CQ1","color":"BA2AAF","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2023-12-13T20:31:06Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T18:42:09Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T18:42:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"repository":{"id":221981891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjE5ODE4OTE=","name":"playwright","full_name":"microsoft/playwright","private":false,"owner":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright","description":"Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation.

add style with `frame.addStyleTag()`.\r\n  - Playwright sends a command to the browser to add style (using a protocol close to [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)).\r\n    ```javascript\r\n    {\r\n      id: 6,\r\n      guid: 'frame@3ee5e10621a15eaf80cb985dbccb9a28',\r\n      method: 'addStyleTag',\r\n      params: { content: 'div {}' }\r\n    }\r\n    ``` \r\n- I close the browser.\r\n  - Playwright _removes_ the callbacks from the commands.\r\n- Playwright receives the response from the command.\r\n  ```JavaScript\r\n  {\r\n    id: 6,\r\n    result: { element: { guid: 'handle@7833e65f500bd1d978e1450a5459c7bb' } }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  - Playwright doesn't find the callback associated with the command and throws an exception.\r\n
