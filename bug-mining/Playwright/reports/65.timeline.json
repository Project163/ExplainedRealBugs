You will see a failed snapshot image compare, expected.\r\n6. Look at the paths for attachments 2 and 3\r\n\r\nTo view the changed behavior do the same steps as above, but go into the playwright-v1.43.0 directory.\r\n\r\nThis occurs starting on v1.43.0 and later.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPrior image path was something like this:\r\n\r\n`tmp/test-output/example-lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipiscing-elit-sed-do-eiusmod-tempor-incididunt/example_test/one-two-three-four-actual.png`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nOn v1.43.0 or later (including next) the path and file name have changed. Part of the path is now replaced with `fcf62` in this example and the file name has been merged with what used to be an additional directory.\r\n\r\n`tmp/test-output/example-lorem-ipsum-dolor--fcf62-o-eiusmod-tempor-incididunt/example-test-one-two-three-four-actual.png`\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI don't actually care about the full path naming per se. What I need the original format for is to be able to do the following:\r\n- Copy the updated version of the image into a folder along with it's test name path. Example: `updated_images/example_text/one-two-three-four.png`\r\n- Take the original, diff, and updated versions and stitch them together into a single file. This was something Jest was doing before we migrated to the Playwright runner and folks wanted to keep it since it can be quicker than always getting an artifact from github and running the trace viewer.\r\n\r\nI can code around the shortened path, but at the point where in the global teardown when I do the image juggling I don't have any info to work with except the path when trying to determine how to change `example-test-one-two-three-four-actual.png` into `example_text/one-two-three-four.png`.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 6.8 Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
