have lots of test pages served via tomcat in jsp pages.\r\nThose tests are executed in an async pipeline where we get results next day due to lots of tests.\r\nHowever we also use playwright to visit those jsp pages served via tomcat running a selection of tests (the ones we find crucial) also in our local PRs for fast feedback.\r\nPlaywright is used just to visit those pages and to wait test end signal via exposed binding, all the test exec and assertion is done in the jsp pages themselves.\r\nThis works just fine for a long time now, but we had now a need to write some bf cache tests for our product and this is where we came into an obstacle of getting the exception.\r\nFor now we wrote bf cache tests locally in playwright.\r\n\r\nAt first we thought playwright uses puppeteer as a dependency so we filed an issue there which they fixed, but then we realised playwright is completely separate of it, thus deciding to open an issue here as well, hoping playwright could do the similar workaround puppeteer
