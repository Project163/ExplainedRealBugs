With this option, the test run will fail in such case.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New enviroment variable <code>PLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY</code> controls whether built-in <code>list</code>, <code>line</code> and <code>dot</code> reporters assume a live terminal. For example, this could be useful to disable tty behavior when your CI environment does not handle ANSI control sequences well. Alternatively, you can enable tty behavior even when to live terminal is present, if you plan to post-process the output and handle control sequences.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"# Avoid TTY features that output ANSI control sequences\nPLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY=0 npx playwright test\n\n# Enable TTY features, assuming a terminal width 80\nPLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY=80 npx playwright test\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Avoid TTY features that output ANSI control sequences</span>\nPLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY=0 npx playwright <span class=\"pl-c1\">test</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Enable TTY features, assuming a terminal width 80</span>\nPLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY=80 npx playwright <span class=\"pl-c1\">test</span></pre></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New options <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-respect-git-ignore\" rel=\"nofollow\">testConfig.respectGitIgnore</a> and <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-respect-git-ignore\" rel=\"nofollow\">testProject.respectGitIgnore</a> control whether files matching <code>.gitignore</code> patterns are excluded when searching for tests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New property <code>timeout</code> is now available for custom expect matchers.
