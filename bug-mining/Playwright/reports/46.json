Configure a test id attribute\r\n```js\r\nimport { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';\r\n\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  use: {\r\n    testIdAttribute: 'pw-test-id',\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n2. Create a test that uses `page.getByTestId(...)`\r\n3. Use `page.getByTestId(...)` in [globalSetup function](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-global-setup-teardown#option-2-configure-globalsetup-and-globalteardown) (probably the same happens for the teardown function)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`page.getByTestId(...)` works seamlessly across setup/teardown functions and specs.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nI need to execute\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { selectors } from '@playwright/test'\r\nselectors.setTestIdAttribute('pw-test-id')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order for the selector to work as expected.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.4.1\r\n    Memory: 185.98 MB / 16.00 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 20.11.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.11.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 10.2.4 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.11.0/bin/npm\r\n  Languages:\r\n    Bash: 3.2.57 - /bin/bash\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
