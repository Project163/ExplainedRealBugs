<a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\"

error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts

button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts

button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error
