repro**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/currents-dev/pw-issue-2023-11-23-001\r\n\r\n**Steps**\r\n\r\n- Checkout  the demo repo, follow README instructions\r\n- Run the test for `1.39`\r\n- Run the test for `1.40`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nThe following test suite:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { expect, test } from \"@playwright/test\";\r\n\r\ntest.describe.configure({ mode: \"serial\", retries: 1 });\r\n\r\ntest(\"A\", async ({ page }, { retry }) => {\r\n  if (retry === 0) {\r\n    throw new Error(\"oh!\");\r\n  }\r\n  if (retry === 1) {\r\n    expect(true).toBe(true);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\ntest(\"B\", async ({ page }, { retry }) => {\r\n  throw new Error(\"oh!\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs supposed to produce the following outcome:\r\n- Test A results status: failed, passed\r\n- Test B results status: skipped, failed\r\n\r\n- `onTestBegin` should be invoked for every attempt of every test in a serial group as in `1.39`\r\n- all tests should exhaust all attempts in a serial group\r\n\r\n**Actual**\r\n\r\n`1.40` runs serial tests group differently and produces different results:\r\n- Test A results status: failed, passed\r\n- Test B results status: failed\r\n\r\n\r\n- `1.40` doesn't invoke `onTestBegin` for test `B` when `A` fails\r\n- `1.40` doesn't retry test `B` and \"swallows\" the last retry\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28321/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11077242501,"node_id":"LE_lADODTssw853vseOzwAAAAKUQU6F","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/11077242501","actor":{"login":"pavelfeldman","id":883973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4Mzk3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/883973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman","html_url":"https://github.com/pavelfeldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-28T00:01:33Z","label":{"name":"v1.41","color":"000000"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11077243993,"node_id":"AE_lADODTssw853vseOzwAAAAKUQVRZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/11077243993","actor":{"login":"pavelfeldman","id":883973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4Mzk3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/883973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman","html_url":"https://github.com/pavelfeldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelfeldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-28T00:01:45Z","assignee":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mook-as","id":3977982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Nzc5ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3977982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as","html_url":"https://github.com/mook-as","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mook-as/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-07T18:40:15Z","updated_at":"2023-12-07T18:40:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/issues/6141","repository_url":"https:

Version\r\n\r\n1.42.1\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRepo here: https://github.com/BeeMargarida/playwright-serial-retries-bug\r\n\r\nYou can see the issue in the [pipeline](https://github.com/BeeMargarida/playwright-serial-retries-bug/actions/runs/8266118282/job/22613372136), in the `Run Playwright tests` step.\r\n\r\nBasically, the issue happens in serial mode, where if different tests fail on retries, it will skip not run certain tests and mark the run as successful. \r\n\r\nSimple example of 4 tests and 1 retry:\r\n\r\n**first run:**\r\npasses\r\nfails\r\nskips\r\nskips\r\n\r\n**1st retry:**\r\nfails\r\nskips\r\nskips\r\nskips\r\n\r\nThe run ends with 2 flaky tests, 2 skipped tests and marked as successful. This is not successful, it's a false positive since it didn't run all tests.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe pipeline fails if it doesn't run all tests in a retry, in serial mode.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe pipeline shows as successful even though some tests were not executed.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI'm open to contributing a solution for this, just want feedback on this bug first.\r\n\r\nI know serial mode is not recommended, but the use case for this really requires serial mode since it's an offline first PWA that does a big setup on first launch, so it's not useful to launch a new isolated context for each test.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n  OS: Linux 6.7 EndeavourOS\r\n  CPU: (16) x64 AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processor\r\n
