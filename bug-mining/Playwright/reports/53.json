I expect to see both `\"Fixture teardown starts\"` and `\"Fixture teardown ends\"` log messages\r\n2. I expect the string `\"will never be thrown\"` to be thrown\r\n3. I expect the teardown to take at least 40 seconds\r\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n1. The \"Fixture teardown starts\" text appears, but \"Fixture teardown ends\" is missing\r\n2. The test takes 30.2s\r\n3. No exception is thrown\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe documentation states that:\r\n\r\n> for slow fixtures, especially [worker-scoped](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#worker-scoped-fixtures) ones, it is convenient to have a separate timeout\r\n\r\nThat's why I believe timeouts are expected to work for worker-scoped fixtures.\n\n### Environment\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 6.5 Ubuntu 23.10 23.10 (Mantic Minotaur)\r\n    CPU: (20) x64 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700H\r\n    Memory: 14.82 GB / 31.01 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.12.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.12.1/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.12.1/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 9.5.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.12.1/bin/npm\r\n  IDEs:\r\n    VSCode: 1.88.1 - /usr/bin/code\r\n  Languages:\r\n    Bash: 5.2.15 - /usr/bin/bash\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @playwright/test: ^1.43.1 => 1.43.1\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30504/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
