Install VS Code and add the [Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) extension.\r\n2. Clone https://github.com/twalshOG/PlaywrightBug\r\n3. Run the test (this project only has one test for simplicity sake) from the Playwright test explorer\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/388515e6-69a1-4c9b-aa92-f266ee14c1ba) <br>_Note that global setup ran_  <br>\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/980e2caf-8b4b-430a-8341-23f3cd46c781)\r\n4. Run the test again via the test explorer \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a8bfb18-3434-4489-9b2b-b9acbf6c6358) <br>\r\n_Note that global setup did not run_\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect global setup to run each time I run \n\n### Actual behavior\n\nGlobal setup not running on subsequent runs when tests are run via the Playwright test extension for VS Code.\n\n### Additional context\n\n**Work arounds**\r\n1. Close and reopen VS Code\r\n2. Manually trigger \"Run global teardown\"\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/267d58a2-dde9-4441-866a-8b36b233b6b3) <br>This makes it so the next run will run global setup, but runs after that will continue to skip global setup.\r\n\r\n**Thoughts**\r\n1. This look something was intentionally done\r\n   1. If I am using my own [test web service](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver) it stays up between runs\r\n   2. The SETUP section of the TESTING: PLAYWRIGHT  VSCode bar disables Run global setup and enables Run global teardown.\r\n2. Within many contexts this would work great, however it gets really unpleasant when trying to update/debug global setup\r\n\r\n**Recommendations**\r\n1. Document when global setup/teardown should be/will be executed when using VSCode\r\n2. Add a setting that allows users to decide if they want to use the same global setup between test runs\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d861307-1b4b-499b-ac2e-296bb7093880)\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.5\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1
