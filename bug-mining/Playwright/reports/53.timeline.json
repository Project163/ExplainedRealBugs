you for addressing this issue.\r\nFew words regarding our use case:\r\nIn every test, we are uploading test related resources to our servers. We don't want this long operation to block the worker from proceeding the run with other tests, that's why we use fixtures to wait for this operation to be completed during worker's teardown.\r\nAs a workaround, we have placed the waiting in an `afterAll` clause added to every test file, but performance-wise it's a terrible idea as the worker is stopped from running the next test file until the upload operation is completed.\r\nHaving the ability to use worker-scope teardown could make our (and our some of our clients) test-suite twice as fast.\r\nI hope this explanation shed some light on why this issue is important for us, I'm here to help so please let me know if there's anything I can explain or do better.\r\nThank you very much! :pray:

Version\n\n1.44.0\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Download and unzip [browser-fixture-override-bug.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/files/15261602/browser-fixture-override-bug.zip)\r\n- Run `yarn -E --no-lockfile`\r\n- Run `yarn playwright install chromium`\r\n- Run `yarn playwright test`\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nBoth browser windows are kept opened until you close them\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe one that is using the overridden browser fixture closes after ~30s\n\n### Additional context\n\nBoth fixtures share the following code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({ headless: false });\r\nawait use(browser);\r\nawait expect(() => {\r\n  expect(\r\n    browser\r\n      .contexts()\r\n      .every((context) => context.pages().every((page) => page.isClosed()))\r\n  ).toBe(true);\r\n}).toPass({ intervals: [2_000] });\r\n```\r\n\r\n`expect.toPass` should prevent the browser from closing after being used in test, but it does not work if you are using the overridden browser fixture.\n\n### Environment\n\n```shell\nlstat\r\nENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat\r\nThis is related to npm not being able to find a file.\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30726/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12821353359,"node_id":"CE_lADODTssw86GxUcbzwAAAAL8NlOP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/12821353359","actor":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-15T17:37:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12821353421,"node_id":"REFE_lADODTssw86GxUcbzwAAAAL8NlPN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/12821353421","actor":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5fa0583dcb708e74d2f7fc456b8c44cec9752709","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/commits/5fa0583dcb708e74d2f7fc456b8c44cec9752709","created_at":"2024-05-15T17:37:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
