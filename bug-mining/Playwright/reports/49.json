Something like\r\n\r\n```\r\npage.scroll_to_bottom()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr maybe\r\n\r\n```\r\npage.scroll_to('bottom')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the possible answers are top and bottom.\n\n### Example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe motivation here is that scrolling to the bottom of a page is a common way to trigger infinite scrolling pages to load more content.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to search and find people working around the lack of this feature via Javascript. In fact, a Playwright developer suggests using Javascript in https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/issues/683\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd argue that infinite scrolling pages are common enough that this is a worthwhile feature to add to Playwright.","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30643/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
