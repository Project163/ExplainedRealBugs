However seems like there is some form of hybrid shading algorithm at play here.\n\nBesides that, there has to be a way to shard tests evenly even if I am using a single file because there are many usecases where users might generate tests dynamically and still have beforeEach or beforeAll in their test files.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/comments/2408631043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rohitkrishna094","id":18495886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDk1ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18495886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094","html_url":"https://github.com/rohitkrishna094","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohitkrishna094/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14619293726,"node_id":"SE_lADODTssw86Z-X9pzwAAAANnYLge","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/14619293726","actor":{"login":"mxschmitt","id":17984549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTg0NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17984549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt","html_url":"https://github.com/mxschmitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-13T10:40:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-14T08:21:46Z","updated_at":"2024-10-14T08:21:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/33083","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/33083/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/33083/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/33083/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/33083","id":2585202001,"node_id":"PR_kwDODTssw85-gH2z","number":33083,"title":"fix(test
