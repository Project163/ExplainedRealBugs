@dgozman , @pavelfeldman , we would exactly have the same use case as described by @throw5way. We currently have all teams specify the test metadata like author, ticket, app, etc. in the test.use block, and then have an auto-test fixture to read those properties, verify them, and set them as annotations to pass to our custom reporters. \r\n\r\nSadly, this does not work for skipped tests. As discussed above, the auto fixture body will not get executed, and therefore, we are missing all the metadata information for skipped tests, which is not really good. \r\n\r\nThe perfect solution for us would be exactly what @throw5way described [here](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/29229#issuecomment-1921221023). So, to have a fixture option \"always\" that gets executed no matter the test resolution. Copy of the proposed solution:\r\n```ts\r\nconst modifyLabels = [\r\n  async ({ }, use, testInfo) => {\r\n    allure.layer('system');\r\n    await use();\r\n  },\r\n  { always: true },\r\n]\r\n\r\ntest.skip('foo', () => {\r\n  // fixture was executed, body of the test wasn't\r\n});

🚀 Feature Request\n\nOriginates from: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/29229\r\n\r\nWe currently have all teams specify metadata information such as author, ticket, app, tags in the `test.use({...})` block, in the following way:\r\n```typescript\r\ntest.use({\r\n  author: Author.SOME_AUTHOR,\r\n  ticket: 'TICKET-1234',\r\n  app: APPS.SOME_APP,\r\n  tags: ['some-tag'],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the great benefit, that it is not needed to specify the information for each test, in case it is the same, because it re-uses the information for each test in the same file, until a new `test.use` block is specified. \r\n\r\nSadly, we have the issue with this implementation that skipped tests are not reported because the auto test-scoped fixture, in which we pick up, validate, and send the metadata to our custom reporters, is not executed. \r\n\r\nhow our auto test-scoped fixture looks like:\r\n```typescript\r\n  metaDataHandler: [\r\n    async ({ page, app, author, ticket, tags, userRole, logger, browser }, use, testInfo) => {\r\n\r\n      // do some validation & attach it to the metadata.json via `testInfo.attach(...`\r\n      await use(); // execute test\r\n    },\r\n    { auto: true, scope: 'test' },\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to request a new fixture option that allows running the fixture no matter the test result. Thanks already in advance for your efforts!\n\n### Example\n\n### Usage:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { test as base } from '@playwright/test';\r\n\r\ntype CustomFixtures = {\r\n  metaDataHandler: void;\r\n};\r\ntype CustomOptions = {\r\n  author: string;\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst test = base.extend<CustomOptions & CustomFixtures>({\r\n  author: undefined,\r\n  metaDataHandler: [\r\n    async ({ author }, use, testInfo) => {\r\n      if (!author) {\r\n        throw Error('Please specify an author for the test');\r\n      }\r\n      console.info(`Test Author: ${author}`);\r\n      await testInfo.attach('metadata.json', { body: JSON.stringify({ author: author }) });\r\n      await use();\r\n    },\r\n    { scope: 'test', auto: true, always: true }, // <- new option \"always: true\" which means that it will always executed no matter if the test was skipped or not\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n\r\ntest.use({ author: 'max.mustermann' });\r\n\r\ntest('tryout', async ({ page }) => {\r\n  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/docs');\r\n  // Expected output: Test Author: max.mustermann\r\n});\r\n\r\ntest.skip('skiped tryout', async ({ page }) => {\r\n  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/docs');\r\n  // Expected output: Test Author: max.mustermann\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Motivation\n\nEspecially in bigger companies with platform products, where teams have their own repositories for their app, it is important to have insights into the health/maturity of the app in order to instrument the correct quality gates that prevent or allow a new release of the app in production.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is important for such a quality gate, is to have an overview of all the tests in a central place that shows what features/pages are tested in a certain version of the app or, even more importantly, what features are not tested for that app because the tests are skipped (or no tests exist at all) and could potentially cause an app failure in production.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important to also send the metadata information for skipped tests to ensure that the people responsible for new app releases are aware.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/31605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/31605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
