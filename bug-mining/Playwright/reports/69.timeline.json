can verify them, as specified by TLS Client Authentication.</p>\n<p>When client certificates are specified, all browser traffic is routed through a proxy that establishes the secure TLS connection, provides client certificates to the server and validates server certificates.</p>\n<p>The following snippet sets up a client certificate for <code>https://example.com</code>:</p>\n<div

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"import { handlers } from '@ src/mocks/handlers';\n\ntest.beforeEach(async ({ router }) =&gt; {\n  // install common

shown in UI mode.</li>\n<li>Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.</li>\n<li>New setting to show/hide routing actions like <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route#route-continue\" rel=\"nofollow\">route.continue()</a>.</li>\n<li>Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.</li>\n<li>New button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error messages.</li>\n<li>New option to provide a <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#custom-fixture-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">custom fixture title</a> to be used in test reports and error messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possibly breaking change</h2>\n<p>Fixture values that are array of objects, when specified in the <code>test.use()</code> block, may require being wrapped into a fixture

<a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\"

can verify them, as specified by TLS Client Authentication.</p>\n<p>When client certificates are specified, all browser traffic is routed through a proxy that establishes the secure TLS connection, provides client certificates to the server and validates server certificates.</p>\n<p>The following snippet sets up a client certificate for <code>https://example.com</code>:</p>\n<div

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"import { handlers } from '@ src/mocks/handlers';\n\ntest.beforeEach(async ({ router }) =&gt; {\n  // install common

shown in UI mode.</li>\n<li>Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.</li>\n<li>New setting to show/hide routing actions like <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route#route-continue\" rel=\"nofollow\">route.continue()</a>.</li>\n<li>Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.</li>\n<li>New button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error messages.</li>\n<li>New option to provide a <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#custom-fixture-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">custom fixture title</a> to be used in test reports and error messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possibly breaking change</h2>\n<p>Fixture values that are array of objects, when specified in the <code>test.use()</code> block, may require being wrapped into a fixture

can verify them, as specified by TLS Client Authentication.</p>\n<p>When client certificates are specified, all browser traffic is routed through a proxy that establishes the secure TLS connection, provides client certificates to the server and validates server certificates.</p>\n<p>The following snippet sets up a client certificate for <code>https://example.com</code>:</p>\n<div

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"import { handlers } from '@ src/mocks/handlers';\n\ntest.beforeEach(async ({ router }) =&gt; {\n  // install common

href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components#handling-network-requests\" rel=\"nofollow\">component tests</a>.</p>\n<h2>UI Mode / Trace Viewer Updates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Test annotations are now shown in UI mode.</li>\n<li>Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.</li>\n<li>New setting to show/hide routing actions like <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route#route-continue\" rel=\"nofollow\">route.continue()</a>.</li>\n<li>Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.</li>\n<li>New button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error messages.</li>\n<li>New option to provide a <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#custom-fixture-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">custom fixture title</a> to be used in test reports and error messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possibly breaking change</h2>\n<p>Fixture values that are array of objects, when specified in the <code>test.use()</code> block, may require being wrapped into a fixture

provides client certificates to the server and validates server certificates.</p>\n<p>The following snippet sets up a client certificate for <code>https://example.com</code>:</p>\n<div

<a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts

shown in UI mode.</li>\n<li>Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.</li>\n<li>New setting to show/hide routing actions like <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route#route-continue\" rel=\"nofollow\">route.continue()</a>.</li>\n<li>Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.</li>\n<li>New button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error messages.</li>\n<li>New option to provide a <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#custom-fixture-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">custom fixture title</a> to be used in test reports and error messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possibly breaking change</h2>\n<p>Fixture values that are array of objects, when specified in the <code>test.use()</code> block, may require being wrapped into a fixture

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"import { handlers } from '@ src/mocks/handlers';\n\ntest.beforeEach(async ({ router }) =&gt; {\n  // install common

shown in UI mode.</li>\n<li>Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.</li>\n<li>New setting to show/hide routing actions like <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route#route-continue\" rel=\"nofollow\">route.continue()</a>.</li>\n<li>Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.</li>\n<li>New button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error messages.</li>\n<li>New option to provide a <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#custom-fixture-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">custom fixture title</a> to be used in test reports and error messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possibly breaking change</h2>\n<p>Fixture values that are array of objects, when specified in the <code>test.use()</code> block, may require being wrapped into a fixture

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts

button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error

can verify them, as specified by TLS Client Authentication.</p>\n<p>When client certificates are specified, all browser traffic is routed through a proxy that establishes the secure TLS connection, provides client certificates to the server and validates server certificates.</p>\n<p>The following snippet sets up a client certificate for <code>https://example.com</code>:</p>\n<div

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"import { handlers } from '@ src/mocks/handlers';\n\ntest.beforeEach(async ({ router }) =&gt; {\n  // install common

href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components#handling-network-requests\" rel=\"nofollow\">component tests</a>.</p>\n<h2>UI Mode / Trace Viewer Updates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Test annotations are now shown in UI mode.</li>\n<li>Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.</li>\n<li>New setting to show/hide routing actions like <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route#route-continue\" rel=\"nofollow\">route.continue()</a>.</li>\n<li>Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.</li>\n<li>New button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error messages.</li>\n<li>New option to provide a <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#custom-fixture-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">custom fixture title</a> to be used in test reports and error messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possibly breaking change</h2>\n<p>Fixture values that are array of objects, when specified in the <code>test.use()</code> block, may require being wrapped into a fixture

can verify them, as specified by TLS Client Authentication.</p>\n<p>When client certificates are specified, all browser traffic is routed through a proxy that establishes the secure TLS connection, provides client certificates to the server and validates server certificates.</p>\n<p>The following snippet sets up a client certificate for <code>https://example.com</code>:</p>\n<div

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"import { handlers } from '@ src/mocks/handlers';\n\ntest.beforeEach(async ({ router }) =&gt; {\n  // install common

href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components#handling-network-requests\" rel=\"nofollow\">component tests</a>.</p>\n<h2>UI Mode / Trace Viewer Updates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Test annotations are now shown in UI mode.</li>\n<li>Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.</li>\n<li>New setting to show/hide routing actions like <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route#route-continue\" rel=\"nofollow\">route.continue()</a>.</li>\n<li>Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.</li>\n<li>New button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error messages.</li>\n<li>New option to provide a <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#custom-fixture-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">custom fixture title</a> to be used in test reports and error messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possibly breaking change</h2>\n<p>Fixture values that are array of objects, when specified in the <code>test.use()</code> block, may require being wrapped into a fixture

<a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\"

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts

shown in UI mode.</li>\n<li>Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.</li>\n<li>New setting to show/hide routing actions like <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route#route-continue\" rel=\"nofollow\">route.continue()</a>.</li>\n<li>Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.</li>\n<li>New button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error messages.</li>\n<li>New option to provide a <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#custom-fixture-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">custom fixture title</a> to be used in test reports and error messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possibly breaking change</h2>\n<p>Fixture values that are array of objects, when specified in the <code>test.use()</code> block, may require being wrapped into a fixture
