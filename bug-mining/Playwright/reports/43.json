The docs have examples like:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npage.on('dialog', dialog => dialog.accept());\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npage.on('console', async msg => {\r\n  const values = [];\r\n  for (const arg of msg.args())\r\n    values.push(await arg.jsonValue());\r\n  console.log(...values);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the types are:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\non(event: 'console', listener: (consoleMessage: ConsoleMessage) => void): this;\r\n\r\non(event: 'dialog', listener: (dialog: Dialog) => void): this;\r\n\r\non(event: 'filechooser', listener: (fileChooser: FileChooser) => void): this;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of them say the return must be `void` and not `Promise<void>`.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the [no-floating-promises](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises/) ESLint rule flags these. But more importantly, if they truly are not handled, they could cause crashing or hanging.\r\n\r\nResolution:\r\n\r\n- If the code that calls the handler _does_ await the promise or catch errors from it, then the TypeScript return types should be `void | Promise<void>` and the docs do not need to be updated.\r\n- Or if the TypeScript types _do_ match the code behavior, then the documentation examples need to be updated to have `.catch()` on all the promises. (More generally, every code example should pass `no-floating-promises` checks.)\r\n\r\nFinally, there is one code example in the docs [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-event-dialog) that is wrong either way:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npage.on('dialog', dialog => {\r\n  dialog.accept();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the braces, this is not returning the promise, so it either needs to return it or add `.catch`, depending on which resolution is used above.","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29353/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
