🚀 Feature Request\n\nWe currently have isVisible(), isHidden(), isEnabled(), etc....  available for locators.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to expose these methods to other elements such as:  frameLocator, frame, etc....  ?\r\n\r\nAsking because:  One of the websites I am working on have many frameLocators and frames, and depending on the situation, they might be visible or hidden, and I would like to have the ability to check on them.\n\n### Example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation\n\nI think this feature might become handy to others as well if they are working on similar websites like the one I am working with.","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29336/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
