Despite the link being clickable by a user in a real browser, Playwright considers the entire label element disabled and retries the click action multiple times, eventually failing with an error.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest('should click Google link inside a disabled label', async ({ page }) => {\r\n\tawait page.setContent(`\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input type=\"radio\" id=\"huey\" name=\"drone\" value=\"huey\" checked disabled />\r\n      <label onclick=\"alert('Click is working!!!')\" for=\"huey\">Huey <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google link</a></label>\r\n    </div>\r\n  `);\r\n\tawait page.click('text=Google link');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPlaywright should successfully click on the \"Google link\" inside the label, and the navigation should proceed to the linked URL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nPlaywright retries the click action multiple times and eventually fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nretrying click action, attempt #54\r\n  -   waiting 500ms\r\n  -   waiting for element to be visible, enabled, and stable\r\n  -   element is not enabled\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe link inside the label is clickable in a real browser even though the associated radio button is disabled.\r\nPlaywright appears to treat the entire label as disabled because the input it is associated with is disabled.\r\nThis behavior prevents Playwright from interacting with clickable elements inside labels tied to disabled inputs.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.5\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 151.14 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 20.11.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.11.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.21 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.11.0/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 10.2.4 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.11.0/bin/npm\r\n  IDEs:\r\n    VSCode: 1.90.1 - /usr/local/bin/code\r\n  Languages:\r\n    Bash: 5.2.15 - /opt/homebrew/bin/bash\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @playwright/test: 1.44.0 => 1.44.0\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yury-s","id":9798949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTg5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9798949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s","html_url":"https://github.com/yury-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/31359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/31359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
