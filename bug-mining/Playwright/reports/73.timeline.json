Version\n\n1.46.1\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\npoc.ts:\r\n```\r\nimport { expect, test as base } from '@playwright/test';\r\n\r\ntype FixtureOptions = {\r\n  data: { foo: string, bar: string }[];\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst testFixture = base.extend<FixtureOptions>({\r\n  data: [[], { option: false }],\r\n  page: async ({ page, data }, use) => {\r\n    if (!data || !data.length) {\r\n      // data is just { \"foo\": \"foo\", \"bar\": \"bar\" } instead of an array at this point\r\n      throw new Error(':(');\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    await use(page);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\ntestFixture.describe('POC', () => {\r\n  testFixture.use({\r\n    data: [\r\n      { foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar'},\r\n      { foo: 'bar', bar: 'foo'}\r\n    ]\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  testFixture('Should pass', async ({ page }) => {\r\n    expect(true).toBeTruthy();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nplaywright.config.ts:\r\n```\r\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  testDir: './tests',\r\n  fullyParallel: false,\r\n  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,\r\n  retries: 0,\r\n  workers: 1,\r\n  reporter: 'html',\r\n  use: {\r\n    trace: 'on',\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  projects: [\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'chromium',\r\n      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe test passes, as the passed data fixture parameter is an array\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe test  fails in the fixture o nthe parameter validation, as data has no `length` property - in fact it is the first element of the array passed in in `use`\n\n### Additional context\n\n Works fine with 1.45.3\n\n### Environment\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 11 10.0.22631\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1335U\r\n    Memory: 17.32 GB

Last Good Version\n\n1.45\n\n### First Bad Version\n\n1.46, 1.47\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAfter upgrading to Playwright 1.47 from 1.45, I discovered that the behavior of using a fixture accepting array of objects changed.\r\n\r\nI have prepared a simplified example that illustrates this situation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { test as baseTest } from '@playwright/test';\r\n\r\nconst test = baseTest.extend<{\r\n    array: any[];\r\n}>({});\r\n\r\ntest.use({\r\n    array: [{ foo: '1' }, { foo: '2' }],\r\n});\r\n\r\ntest('Example test', ({ array }) => {\r\n    console.log(array);\r\n});\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen running this code on Playwright 1.45 it prints:\r\n`[ { foo: '1' }, { foo: '2' } ]`\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nWhen running this code on Playwright 1.46 it prints:\r\n`{ foo: '1' }`\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt used to work before, so it looks like a regression to me. When using e.g. array of numbers, it works as expected.\n\n### Environment\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 11 10.0.22631\r\n    CPU: (20) x64 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12800H\r\n    Memory: 4.97 GB / 31.69 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 20.12.2 -
