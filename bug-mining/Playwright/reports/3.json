This does not happen on Firefox + macOS/Windows. I've only reproduced this on Linux + GitHub Actions. I'm not sure if this is caused by Playwright or Firefox. If this would be better reported to the Firefox, please let me know and I can do that instead.\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/liamdebeasi/playwright-meta-repro\r\n\r\nTest: https://github.com/liamdebeasi/playwright-meta-repro/blob/ee8866c61c8c0b1911b1892882adf30d6210e6d2/tests/example.spec.js#L4-L15\r\n\r\nTest Run Example: https://github.com/liamdebeasi/playwright-meta-repro/actions/runs/7103647456/job/19336824001\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nI expect the \"OS\" text to not be added to the text input when pressing the \"Meta\" key on Firefox.\r\n\r\n**Actual**\r\n\r\nThe \"OS\" text is added to the text input when pressing the \"Meta\" key on Firefox.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mxschmitt","id":17984549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTg0NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17984549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt","html_url":"https://github.com/mxschmitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxschmitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
