Version\n\n@latest\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\ntest('download should work', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {\r\n    await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/docs/intro');\r\n    const screenshot = await page.screenshot();\r\n    expect(screenshot).toMatchSnapshot('landing-page.png');\r\n  });\n\n### Expected behavior\n\ndownload should work\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nin ui mode and vs code extension the download shows[::1] instead of localhost. when you click download it downloads a long name with no .png extension so you have to manually add that in order to be able to open the image. trace viewer from html report works as expected\n\n### Additional context\n\n**Beautiful filename**\r\n<img width=\"366\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-30 at 11 53 02\"
