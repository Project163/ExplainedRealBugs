bug**\r\nSetting up a request context in the the `beforeAll()`-hook using the fixture, to prep the test environment before the tests run, which works fine, but after all tests have run, when the clean-ups steps should run, the context is no longer reachable. This used to work in `1.39.0` \r\n\r\nAdd any other details about the problem here.\r\n```\r\nRunning 2 tests using 1 worker\r\n[chromium] › example.spec.ts:16:7 › has title\r\nrunning before all\r\n  1) [chromium] › example.spec.ts:23:7 › get started link ──────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n    Error: apiRequestContext.storageState: Target page, context or browser has been closed\r\n\r\n       9 |\r\n      10 |   test.afterAll(async () => {\r\n    > 11 |     const storage = await context.storageState();\r\n         |                                   ^\r\n      12 |     console.log(storage);\r\n      13 |     console.log(\"running after all\");\r\n      14 |   });\r\n\r\n  1 failed\r\n    [chromium] › example.spec.ts:23:7 › get started link ───────────────────────────────────────────\r\n  1 passed (2.7s)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29260/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29260/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
