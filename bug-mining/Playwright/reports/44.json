🚀 Feature Request\n\nit would be nice if handlers added by `addLocatorHandler` could be removed\n\n### Example\n\nremove a handler at a certain point in the test:\r\n```ts\r\nconst handler = await page.addLocatorHandler(page.getByText('Sign up to the newsletter'), async () => {\r\n  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'No thanks' }).click();\r\n});\r\n\r\nawait page.goto('https://example.com');\r\nawait page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Start here' }).click();\r\n\r\n// at this point we can be confident that the popup has either already appeared, or won't appear at all,\r\n// so it's safe to remove the handler.\r\nhandler.remove() \r\n```\r\n\r\nremove a handler after it's called once:\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nawait page.addLocatorHandler(page.getByText('Sign up to the newsletter'), async (handler) => {\r\n  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'No thanks' }).click();\r\n  handler.remove()\r\n});\n\n### Motivation\n\n- in some cases, a locator handler is only needed once\r\n- at a certain point in the test, you can often be confident that a handler is no longer needed","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30471/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
