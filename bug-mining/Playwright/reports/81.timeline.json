Have you considered [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro) in order to debug your failing tests?\r\n\r\n@mxschmitt Of course I archive the trace.zip in jenkins when test fails as it is definitely useful! But the playwright debug output is extremely useful in the logs for different reasons:\r\n1. failure triage (versus debugging). if test fails i go to \"failed tests\" in jenkins and it shows stderr with `pw:api` calls with associated timing information. it gives \"basic test logging\" with output consistent with any other test in any other tool/programming language (and we have many others in the build): textual output from the build is helpful for at least a basic understanding of which test failed and why, without downloading zip files and running a GUI.\r\n2. debugging low-level failures. in our tests we do some tricky things such as kerberos single-sign-on, we have encountered bugs in chromium, we have workaround place for said bugs, and special setup in place, hence having access to `pw:browser` logs is
