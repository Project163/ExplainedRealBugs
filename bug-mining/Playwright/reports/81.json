I was hoping this would engage the color-filtering here: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/b5d968fa0e3acb052de4eab5952f6efb668d9111/packages/playwright-core/src/utils/debugLogger.ts#L40-L44\n\n### Example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation\n\nCI logs are filled with ansi colors with no way to disable them.\r\nI don't give playwright process a TTY (runs via docker) but the debugging logs are still colored.\r\nUnfortunately, NO_COLOR environment variable is not respected: https://no-color.org/\r\n\r\nIt makes it extremely difficult to debug tests from:\r\n* jenkins \"Test Report\" (/testReport). This displays the output from the `junit` reporter for a particular test (e.g. the one that failed) and is the most intuitive and fast way to triage a failing test. Unfortunately all the debug output shows as ansi escapes.\r\n* full jenkins logfiles. We have a lot of tests and scrolling with the built-in console can be frustrating.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/32543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/32543/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
