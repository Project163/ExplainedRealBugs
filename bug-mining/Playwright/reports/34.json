But the default value of `intervals` can be modified only using the function and not in the `playwright.config` file to apply the default intervals to the entire application","closed_by":{"login":"yury-s","id":9798949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTg5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9798949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s","html_url":"https://github.com/yury-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30040/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
