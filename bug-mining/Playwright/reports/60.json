🚀 Feature Request\n\nIn #4752, we got types for screenshot-taking methods.\r\n\r\nHowever, the types for screenshot-expecting methods (`expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(..., options)`) don't have their own aliases, which makes it very tricky to write fully-typed wrappers over `expect(...).toHaveScreenshot`.\r\n\r\nRight now it can be written like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\noptions?: Parameters<ReturnType<typeof expect<Page>>['toHaveScreenshot']>[0],\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Example\n\n_No response_\n\n###
