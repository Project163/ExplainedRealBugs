Thus, the element and its children all have the same opacity relative to the element's background, even if they have different opacities relative to one another.\r\n\r\nHowever, the calculated opacity of the input _is_ `1`, not `0`:\r\n\r\n    window.getComputedStyle(playwright.$('[name=\"name\"]:visible')).getPropertyValue(\"opacity\"); // '1'\r\n\r\nEven though the parent's calculated opacity _is_ 0, as expected:\r\n\r\n     window.getComputedStyle(playwright.$('[style=\"opacity: 0; transform: translateY(1.93193px) translateZ(0px);\"]:visible')).getPropertyValue(\"opacity\"); // '0'\r\n\r\nSo, if Playwright is using `window.getComputedStyle` for its `:visible` check it makes sense why it would see this element as \"visible\".
