wondering to be complete.  I'm thinking about two related issues. \r\n\r\n**First suggestion**: \r\n1.)  Listing tests.\r\n     -list    --  as it works to day no tag info...\r\n     -listTags   --  implies the list of test as we have today but w/Tags  See the test name  but then a list of tags associated with the tests...\r\n     \r\n-list\r\n     testName1\r\n     testName2\r\n     testName3\r\n     \r\n-listTags \r\n     testName1\r\n         tag1, tag2, someOtherTag\r\n     testName2\r\n         en, deskTop, mobile\r\n     testName3\r\n         <no line if no tags, blank line...>  \r\n\r\n**Second Suggestion**.\r\n     Filtering grep'ing based on tags, separately from the test names. From reading the help it appears the -grep will filter by test names and tags, mainly by assuming the @Value is used for the tag name.  Might assert clearner/clearer If there was a separate -grepTag no need for the \"@\" in the \"@Value\".   Also depending on the shell used '@' is particularly a pain for some...   Well unless there is a tag prefix character users may change?  Or better yet having the grepTag option to only grep tag values, no need for the '@' in the tag names as searching for test names and tags are not overloaded by one search criteria...  Might be me but having two grep command line options just seems cleaner and more deterministic...  Glad to open another issue for these but seems all related... Just let me know...\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/comments/1977620422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ZooDoo4U","id":11509268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA5MjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11509268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U","html_url":"https://github.com/ZooDoo4U","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZooDoo4U/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12005911653,"node_id":"MEE_lADODTssw86BJk6NzwAAAALLm6xl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/12005911653","actor":{"login":"value","id":3872980,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4NzI5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3872980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/value","html_url":"https://github.com/value","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/value/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/value/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/value/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/value/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/value/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/value/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/value/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/value/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/value/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-04T23:03:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12030500922,"node_id":"CE_lADODTssw86BJk6NzwAAAALNEuA6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/12030500922","actor":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-06T16:33:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12030501148,"node_id":"REFE_lADODTssw86BJk6NzwAAAALNEuEc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/12030501148","actor":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"425f737eb6acae72ee75ab278b34d969891260cf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/commits/425f737eb6acae72ee75ab278b34d969891260cf","created_at":"2024-03-06T16:33:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login

supported):\r\n```ts\r\ntest('test customer login', {\r\ntag: ['https://github.com/fast', '@login'],\r\n}, async ({ page }) => {\r\n// ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\nUse --grep command line option to run only tests with certain tags.\r\n```\r\nnpx playwright test --grep https://github.com/fast\r\n```\r\n**A solution**\r\nAdd Cucumber tags to generated test files for Playwright >=
