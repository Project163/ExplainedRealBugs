@dgozman \r\n\r\nThank you for the suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhile your proposal is effective, I still believe it would be beneficial to expose methods like `isVisible()`, `isEnabled()`, and `highlight()`, etc., to `FrameLocators` and `Frames`. I will do my best to describe my use case below, and please feel free to correct me if I am mistaken.\r\n\r\nOur internal website incorporates numerous web services pulled from various microservices. On the homepage alone, we have up to six levels of iframes, each representing a microservice displayed within layers of iframes. It's worth noting that although the contents within each iframe may differ, iframe names can overlap with each other.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is a high-level representation of locators I observe from my homepage:\r\n\r\n- `page.frameLocator(frame1).frameLocator(frame2).frameLocator(frame3).frameLocator(frame4).frameLocator(frame5).frameLocator(frame6).locator();`\r\n- `page.frameLocator(frame1).frameLocator(frame2).frameLocator(frame3).locator();`\r\n- `page.frameLocator(frame1).frameLocator(frame4).frameLocator(frame5).locator();`\r\n- `page.frameLocator(frame1).frameLocator(frame6).locator();`\r\n- `page.frameLocator(frame1).frameLocator(frame6).frameLocator(frame2).locator();`\r\n- `etc...`\r\n\r\nIn my case, having `isVisible()` and especially `highlight()` exposed will enable me to focus on all the locators associated with a particular iframe, and makes it easier to troubleshoot.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/comments/1928773978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"qk5","id":72669523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjY5NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72669523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5","html_url":"https://github.com/qk5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qk5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11712878713,"node_id":"MEE_lADODTssw85-KY5ZzwAAAAK6JFh5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/11712878713","actor":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-06T04:45:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11712878723,"node_id":"SE_lADODTssw85-KY5ZzwAAAAK6JFiD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/events/11712878723","actor":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-06T04:45:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/comments/1930530235","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/29336#issuecomment-1930530235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29336","id":1930530235,"node_id":"IC_kwDODTssw85zEY27","user":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-06T18:31:27Z","updated_at":"2024-02-06T18:31:27Z","body":"After
