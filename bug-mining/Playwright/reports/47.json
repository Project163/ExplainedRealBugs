System info\r\n- Playwright Version: [v1.40.1]\r\n- Operating System: [Windows 10]\r\n- Browser: [All]\r\n- Other info:\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nDon't think it's needed for this but I'll gladly work on providing one if you think it is.\r\n\r\n**Steps**\r\n1) Setup Playwright and add the [html reporter](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#html-reporter) as one of the reporters.\r\n2) Set Playwright's `outputDir` to `test-results`\r\n3) Set the list reporter `outputFolder` to `test-results-html-report`\r\n4) Run Playwright tests and you will see a `Configuration Error` message like:\r\n```\r\nConfiguration Error: HTML reporter output folder clashes with the tests output folder:\r\n\r\nhtml reporter folder: C:\\dev\\repos\\github-personal\\playwright-adventures\\demos\\code-coverage-with-istanbul-via-webpack-babel-plugin\\test-results-html-report\r\n\r\ntest results folder: C:\\dev\\repos\\github-personal\\playwright-adventures\\demos\\code-coverage-with-istanbul-via-webpack-babel-plugin\\test-results\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nNo `Configuration Error` message should be displayed.\r\n\r\n**Actual**\r\n\r\nA `Configuration Error` message is displayed.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- I believe that, as per the explanation that @mxschmitt gave in [this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/28610#issuecomment-1854462505), since the `test-results-html-report` directory is not a child of `test-results` directory then there shouldn't be any `Configuration Error` message.\r\n- I believe the problem is in [this `if` condition](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/af5a23e55ffcf3385ba1410980ad19d4795c89bd/packages/playwright/src/reporters/html.ts#L89C12-L89C12): \r\n```\r\nif (outputFolder.startsWith(project.outputDir) || project.outputDir.startsWith(outputFolder)) {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAny folder that `startsWith` the same name as the tests output directory will be flagged, even if it's not a child folder.","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28677/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
