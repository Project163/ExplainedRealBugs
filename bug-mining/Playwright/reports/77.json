Install Playwright version 1.47.0.\r\n2. Write a test using expect.poll with a custom error message:\r\ne.g. `await expect.poll(actual, { message: \"Custom error message\", timeout, intervals }).toBe(expected)`\r\n3. Run the test with a condition that causes the poll to fail.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen the poll fails, the error message should include the custom message\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe failure message does not include the custom message, only showing the default error output.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\n```shell\nPlaywright Version: 1.47.0\r\nNode.js Version: v20.14.0\r\nOS: Mac 13.5.1\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/32582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/32582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
