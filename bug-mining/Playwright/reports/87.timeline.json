However, when clicking `record` to stop recording, the debugger does not update with the generated code. Yet, I figured if I switch `target` from `library` to any other one - the code debugger updates and show the code for the actions that I took. And, when I switch the `target` back to `library` the generated code is shown. \n\nIn simple words, the generated code is only shown when I switch back an fourth between `target` and not immideately after stopping recording.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the code to be generated immideately after I click stop recording on the debugger.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe code is not

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts

provides client certificates to the server and validates server certificates.</p>\n<p>The following snippet sets up a client certificate for <code>https://example.com</code>:</p>\n<div

to intercept and handle network requests in component testing.<br>\nThere are two ways to use the router fixture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call <code>router.route(url, handler)</code> that behaves similarly to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route\" rel=\"nofollow\">page.route()</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <code>router.use(handlers)</code> and pass <a href=\"https://mswjs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSW library</a> request handlers to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example of reusing your existing MSW handlers in the test.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-ts

shown in UI mode.</li>\n<li>Content of text attachments is now rendered inline in the attachments pane.</li>\n<li>New setting to show/hide routing actions like <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route#route-continue\" rel=\"nofollow\">route.continue()</a>.</li>\n<li>Request method and status are shown in the network details tab.</li>\n<li>New button to copy source file location to clipboard.</li>\n<li>Metadata pane now displays the <code>baseURL</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>maxRetries</code> option in <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext#api-request-context-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow\">apiRequestContext.fetch()</a> which retries on the <code>ECONNRESET</code> network error.</li>\n<li>New option to <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#box-fixtures\" rel=\"nofollow\">box a fixture</a> to minimize the fixture exposure in test reports and error

Test runner\n\n-   New option [`timeout`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-step-option-timeout) allows specifying a maximum run time for an individual test step. A timed-out step will fail the execution of the test.\n\n    ```js\n    test('some test', async ({ page }) => {\n      await test.step('a step', async () => {\n        // This step can time out separately from the test\n      }, { timeout: 1000 });\n    });\n    ```\n\n-   New method [test.step.skip()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-step-skip) to disable execution of a test step.\n\n    ```js\n    test('some test', async ({ page }) => {\n      await test.step('before running step', async () => {\n        // Normal step\n      });\n\n      await test.step.skip('not yet ready', async () => {\n        // This step is skipped\n      });\n\n      await test.step('after running step', async () => {\n        // This step still runs even though the previous one was skipped\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n\n-   Expanded [expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locatorassertions#locator-assertions-to-match-aria-snapshot-2) to allow storing of aria snapshots in separate YAML files.\n\n-   Added method [expect(locator).toHaveAccessibleErrorMessage()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locatorassertions#locator-assertions-to-have-accessible-error-message) to assert the Locator points to an element with a given [aria errormessage](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-errormessage).\n\n-   Option [testConfig.updateSnapshots](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-update-snapshots) added the configuration enum `changed`. `changed` updates only the snapshots that have changed, whereas `all` now updates all snapshots, regardless of whether there are any differences.\n\n-   New option [testConfig.updateSourceMethod](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-update-source-method) defines the way source code is updated when [testConfig.updateSnapshots](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-update-snapshots) is configured. Added `overwrite` and `3-way` modes that write the changes into source code, on top of existing `patch` mode that creates a patch file.\n\n    ```bash\n    npx playwright test --update-snapshots=changed --update-source-method=3way\n    ```\n\n-   Option [testConfig.webServer](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-web-server) added a `gracefulShutdown` field for specifying a process kill signal other than the default `SIGKILL`.\n\n-   Exposed [testStep.attachments](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststep#test-step-attachments) from the reporter API to allow retrieval of all attachments created by that step.\n\n-   New option `pathTemplate` for `toHaveScreenshot` and `toMatchAriaSnapshot` assertions in the [testConfig.expect](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-expect) configuration.\n\n#### UI updates\n\n-   Updated default HTML reporter to improve display of attachments.\n-   New button for picking elements to produce aria snapshots.\n-   Additional details (such as keys pressed) are now displayed alongside action API calls in traces.\n-   Display of `canvas` content in traces is error-prone. Display is now disabled by default, and can be enabled via the `Display canvas content` UI setting.\n-   `Call` and `Network` panels now display additional time information.\n\n#### Breaking\n\n-   [expect(locator).toBeEditable()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locatorassertions#locator-assertions-to-be-editable) and [locator.isEditable()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-is-editable) now throw if the target element is not `<input>`, `<select>`, or a number of other editable elements.\n-   Option [testConfig.updateSnapshots](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-update-snapshots) now updates all snapshots when set to `all`, rather than only the failed/changed snapshots. Use the new enum `changed` to keep the old functionality of only updating the changed snapshots.\n\n#### Browser Versions\n\n-   Chromium 133.0.6943.16\n-   Mozilla Firefox 134.0\n-   WebKit 18.2\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\n-   Google Chrome 132\n-   Microsoft Edge 132\n\n### [`v1.49.1`](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.49.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/compare/v1.49.0...v1.49.1)\n\n##### Highlights\n\n[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33802](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33802) - \\[Bug]: Codegen's Clear button doesn't work if not recording[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33806](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33806)6 - \\[Bug]: playwright hangs while waiting for pending navigation[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33787](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33787)87 - \\[Bug]: VSC extension isn't capturing all entered te[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33788](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33788)788 - \\[Regression]: Double clicking the steps in trace viewer doesn't filter acti[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33772](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33772)3772 - \\[Bug]: aria_snapshot generates invalid yaml when combined with an aria-label attr[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33791](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33791)33791 - \\[Bug]: text input with number value raises \"container is not iterable\" with to_match_aria_sna[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33644](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33644)/33644 - \\[Bug]: getByRole can't find element with the accessible name from label element when aria-labelledby is not[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33660](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33660)s/33660 - \\[Regression]: Unable to open Playwright UI in Dark Mode\n\n#### Browser Versions\n\n-   Chromium 131.0.6778.33\n-   Mozilla Firefox 132.0\n-   WebKit 18.2\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\n-   Google Chrome 130\n-   Microsoft Edge 130\n\n### [`v1.49.0`](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.49.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/compare/v1.48.2...v1.49.0)\n\n#### Aria snapshots\n\nNew assertion [expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locatorassertions#locator-assertions-to-match-aria-snapshot) verifies page structure by comparing to an expected accessibility tree, represented as YAML.\n\n```js\nawait page.goto('https://playwright.dev');\nawait expect(page.locator('body')).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`\n  - banner:\n    - heading /Playwright enables reliable/ [level=1]\n    - link \"Get started\"\n    - link \"Star microsoft/playwright on GitHub\"\n  - main:\n    - img \"Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)\"\n    - heading \"Any browser • Any platform • One API\"\n`);\n```\n\nYou can generate this assertion with [Test Generator](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen) and update the expected snapshot with `--update-snapshots` command line flag.\n\nLearn more in the [aria snapshots guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/aria-snapshots).\n\n#### Test runner\n\n-   New option [testConfig.tsconfig](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-tsconfig) allows to specify a single `tsconfig` to be used for all tests.\n-   New method [test.fail.only()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-fail-only) to focus on a failing test.\n-   Options [testConfig.globalSetup](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-global-setup) and [testConfig.globalTeardown](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-global-teardown) now support multiple setups/teardowns.\n-   New value `'on-first-failure'` for [testOptions.screenshot](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-screenshot).\n-   Added \"previous\" and \"next\" buttons to the HTML report to quickly switch between test cases.\n-   New properties [testInfoError.cause](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfoerror#test-info-error-cause) and [testError.cause](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testerror#test-error-cause) mirroring [`Error.cause`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause).\n\n#### Breaking: channels `chrome`, `msedge` and similar switch to new headless\n\nThis change affects you if you're using one of the following channels in your `playwright.config.ts`:\n\n-   `chrome`, `chrome-dev`, `chrome-beta`, or `chrome-canary`\n-   `msedge`, `msedge-dev`, `msedge-beta`, or `msedge-canary`\n\n##### What do I need to do?\n\nAfter updating to Playwright v1.49, run your test suite. If it still passes, you're good to go. If not, you will probably need to update your snapshots, and adapt some of your test code around PDF viewers and extensions. See [issue #&#8203;33566](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33566) for more details.\n\n#### Other breaking changes\n\n-   There will be no more updates for WebKit on Ubuntu 20.04 and Debian 11. We recommend updating your OS to a later version.\n-   Package `@playwright/experimental-ct-vue2` will no longer be updated.\n-   Package `@playwright/experimental-ct-solid` will no longer be updated.\n\n#### Try new Chromium headless\n\nYou can opt into the new headless mode by using `'chromium'` channel. As [official Chrome documentation puts it](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell):\n\n> New Headless on the other hand is the real Chrome browser, and is thus more authentic, reliable, and offers more features. This makes it more suitable for high-accuracy end-to-end web app testing or browser extension testing.\n\nSee [issue #&#8203;33566](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33566) for the list of possible breakages you could encounter and more details on Chromium headless. Please file an issue if you see any problems after opting in.\n\n```js\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@&#8203;playwright/test';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  projects: [\n    {\n      name: 'chromium',\n      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], channel: 'chromium' },\n    },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\n-   `<canvas>` elements inside a snapshot now draw a preview.\n-   New method [tracing.group()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-group) to visually group actions in the trace.\n-   Playwright docker images switched from Node.js v20 to Node.js v22 LTS.\n\n#### Browser Versions\n\n-   Chromium 131.0.6778.33\n-   Mozilla Firefox 132.0\n-   WebKit 18.2\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\n-   Google Chrome 130\n-   Microsoft Edge 130\n\n### [`v1.48.2`](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.48.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
