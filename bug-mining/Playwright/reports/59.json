The errors look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      THREE.WebGLRenderer: A WebGL context could not be created. Reason:  Could not create a WebGL context, VENDOR = 0xffff, DEVICE = 0xffff, GL_VENDOR = Google Inc.

I'm not sure if Web Test Runner has to do with the cause of the issue.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nI ran this inside GitHub Actions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.4.1\r\n    Memory: 2.69 GB / 7.00 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 20.12.2 - ~/hostedtoolcache/node/20.12.2/arm64/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - ~/.yarn/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 10.5.0 - ~/hostedtoolcache/node/20.12.2/arm64/bin/npm\r\n  Languages:\r\n    Bash: 3.2.57 - /bin/bash\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30585/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
