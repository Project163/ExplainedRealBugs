My proposal is to add property **IgnoreCase** [bool]? (optional) to options PageAssertionsToHaveURLOptions? (optional)\r\n\r\nhttps://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-url\n\n### Example\n\nawait Page.GotoAsync(\"https://www.facebook.com/microsoft\"); // it will auto-change to Microsoft\r\nawait Expect(Page).ToHaveURLAsync(\"https://www.facebook.com/microsoft/\"); // this will fail\n\n### Motivation\n\n- facilitate waiting for URL when case does not matter\r\n- IgnoreCase parameter in ToHaveURLAsync would be consistent with ToHaveTextAsync() and ToContainTextAsync() methods that also compare text and support case insensitive comparison.","closed_by":{"login":"yury-s","id":9798949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTg5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9798949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s","html_url":"https://github.com/yury-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yury-s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30057/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
