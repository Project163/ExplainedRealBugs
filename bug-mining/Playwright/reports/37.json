🚀 Feature Request\n\nAllow the customizing of the Junit Output, specifically in our case the title.\r\n\r\nThe current code removes the project and other parts : \r\n\r\n```\r\n      attributes: {\r\n        // Skip root, project, file\r\n        name: test.titlePath().slice(3).join(' › '),\r\n        // filename\r\n        classname: suiteName,\r\n        time: (test.results.reduce((acc, value) => acc + value.duration, 0)) / 1000\r\n\r\n      },\r\n```\n\n### Example\n\n\r\nIn Azure Devops it's hard to differentiate between one testcase run against multiple projects:\r\nthe below is from 4 different projects.\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/37447884/53479452-0119-4abb-898c-27dee8b9fe3a)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Motivation\n\nMy use case is in Azure devops, but there are many different CI/CD Systems, to it would be IDEAL if we could provide a template like jest-junit but anything to start off with would be good!\r\n\r\nor a way for us to easily override parts of the junit-reporters, without having to hack into the imports of playwright\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/30246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
