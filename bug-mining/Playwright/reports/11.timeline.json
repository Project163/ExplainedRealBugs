They should never see a screen like this one:\r\n<img width=\"1487\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/152227747/a12c2446-3ceb-45c2-8851-f212491b9e35\">\r\n\r\nNOTE: Every other tab is similarly empty, except for the Source tab, which just shows the test itself:\r\n<img width=\"1494\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/152227747/c784e443-5668-4ae9-b93a-417e45cc1602\">\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nYou see a screen like the above.\r\n\r\nLook, Playwright knows why it stopped running 100% of the time, right?  There's no reason why it shouldn't report that reason 100% of the time also.  Ideally every test failure should have _some_ explanatory text in the Errors tab, but if not there then at least in some other tab.\r\n\r\nOf course, in these situations Playwright doesn't have an obvious error, so it can't show a lot of info ... but it should still be able to say \"the test ran too long and exceeded the timeout\", or \"a promise didn't finish in a beforeEach\" or _something_ that conveys why it stopped running.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nObviously, the specific reason this is happening has to do with my test code, but the issue I'm trying to raise is not specific to my code.  It shouldn't matter what the test code is:  the test runner always knows why its exiting, so I'm simply requesting that it always surface that information.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.3\r\n    Memory: 53.08 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 21.2.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.21 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 10.2.3 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Languages:\r\n    Bash: 3.2.57 - /bin/bash\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
