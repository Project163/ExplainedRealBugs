Add a tag to the title and a tag using new syntax to a test. \r\n2. Run test in ui mode\r\n3. Filter for `@fast` - works\r\n4. Filter for `@login` - doesn't work\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntest('get started link @fast', {\r\n  tag: ['@login'],\r\n}, async ({ page }) => {\r\n  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');\r\n\r\n  await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click();\r\n\r\n  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Installation' })).toBeVisible();\r\n});\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nUsing UI modes filter should be able to filter for @login when using new syntax. works with previous syntax when @login is in the title`\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nisn't able to find tests with the `@login` tag\n\n### Additional context\n\n<img width=\"262\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-05 at 10 10 50\" src=\"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/ca84266f-869d-4968-b54c-cf41a5ad128b\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"261\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-05 at 10 10 38\" src=\"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/c321132f-bfc3-4f46-9d78-3de16caf3e48\">\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.3.1\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 422.63 MB / 64.00 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.18.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 9.8.1 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n    pnpm: 8.5.0 - /usr/local/bin/pnpm\r\n  IDEs:\r\n    VSCode: 1.87.0 - /usr/local/bin/code\r\n  Languages:\r\n    Bash: 3.2.57 - /bin/bash\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @playwright/test: ^1.43.0-alpha-2024-03-05 => 1.43.0-alpha-2024-03-05\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29815/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/29815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
