⚠️⚠️ Do not delete this template ⚠️⚠️ -->\r\n\r\n<!-- 🔎 Search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n<!-- 🧪 Test using the latest Playwright release to see if your issue has already

Browser: All\r\n- Other info:\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\n- [x] I provided the exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.\r\n\r\n<!-- For simple cases, please provide a self-contained test file along with the config file -->\r\n<!-- For larger cases, you can provide a GitHub repo you created for this issue -->\r\n<!-- If we can not reproduce the problem locally, we

(self-contained)**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { expect, test } from \"@playwright/test\";\r\n\r\ntest.describe.configure({ mode: \"serial\", retries: 3 });\r\n\r\ntest(\"A\", async ({ page }, { retry })

0\r\n\r\n`1.39` produces the following outcome for attempts:\r\n\r\n- Test A: `failed`, `passed`, `failed`, `passed`\r\n- Test B: `skipped`, `failed`, `skipped`, `failed`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\n- Test `B` should not be `flaky`, it should be `failed`. All the non-skipped attempts do not match the expected status - i.e. the test never produces the expected `passed` status.\r\n- CLI exit status should not be 0 to mark \r\n\r\n**Actual**\r\n\r\n- Both tests are identified as flaky\r\n- CLI exit status is 0 and the CI passes\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28322/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":4},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
