repro**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/currents-dev/pw-issue-2023-11-23-001\r\n\r\n**Steps**\r\n\r\n- Checkout  the demo repo, follow README instructions\r\n- Run the test for `1.39`\r\n- Run the test for `1.40`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nThe following test suite:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { expect, test } from \"@playwright/test\";\r\n\r\ntest.describe.configure({ mode: \"serial\", retries: 1 });\r\n\r\ntest(\"A\", async ({ page }, { retry }) => {\r\n  if (retry === 0) {\r\n    throw new Error(\"oh!\");\r\n  }\r\n  if (retry === 1) {\r\n    expect(true).toBe(true);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\ntest(\"B\", async ({ page }, { retry }) => {\r\n  throw new Error(\"oh!\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs supposed to produce the following outcome:\r\n- Test A results status: failed, passed\r\n- Test B results status: skipped, failed\r\n\r\n- `onTestBegin` should be invoked for every attempt of every test in a serial group as in `1.39`\r\n- all tests should exhaust all attempts in a serial group\r\n\r\n**Actual**\r\n\r\n`1.40` runs serial tests group differently and produces different results:\r\n- Test A results status: failed, passed\r\n- Test B results status: failed\r\n\r\n\r\n- `1.40` doesn't invoke `onTestBegin` for test `B` when `A` fails\r\n- `1.40` doesn't retry test `B` and \"swallows\" the last retry\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgozman","id":9881434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9881434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman","html_url":"https://github.com/dgozman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgozman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright/issues/28321/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
