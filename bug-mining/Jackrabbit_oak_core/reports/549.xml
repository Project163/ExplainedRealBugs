                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Node.getReferences() traverses all items in the repository in order to find the properties that reference the given node. this is super slow and does not scale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the (weak) reference properties should be auto-indexed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13812769" author="mduerig" created="Mon, 4 Nov 2013 11:38:00 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://markmail.org/message/oewsslpiyg44kftv&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;discussed &lt;/a&gt; we want to implement back references from referenced nodes to its referrers, which should also address this issue. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13821680" author="alex.parvulescu" created="Wed, 13 Nov 2013 19:00:01 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Attaching patch to switch from query to the hidden property introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-685&quot; title=&quot;Enforce referential integrity for referenceable nodes&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;OAK-685&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;OAK-685&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is getting a nodestate from a tree as trees cannot access hidden nodes. this is marked as a TODO in the code.&lt;br/&gt;
as the node state is available from the AbstractTree I would propose promoting that to the Tree api.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the code is a lot slimmer now, did not look at any perf benchmarks yet. are there any I could reference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;feedback needed.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13821706" author="jukkaz" created="Wed, 13 Nov 2013 19:21:23 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;switch from query to the hidden property&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t like this approach. It would IMHO be better if the references were still accessed through a query, and we&apos;d treat the hidden back-reference properties just as an extra query index.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13822284" author="alex.parvulescu" created="Thu, 14 Nov 2013 09:46:07 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Why would we still use a query for this? &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-685&quot; title=&quot;Enforce referential integrity for referenceable nodes&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;OAK-685&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;OAK-685&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; saves all of the refs on the node via a commit hook so there&apos;s no risk in losing any data.&lt;br/&gt;
Also, a query assumes that there will be an index, otherwise it will fallback to traversal, and for a few hundred thousand nodes, that&apos;s not an attractive scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13822293" author="alex.parvulescu" created="Thu, 14 Nov 2013 10:01:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Seeing that there&apos;s still stuff to be discussed here, I move this to 0.12 so that it doesn&apos;t interfere with the release.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13822298" author="mduerig" created="Thu, 14 Nov 2013 10:26:08 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think what Jukka meant was to make the query implementation to use the hidden back reference property as an additional index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However resolving references through queries is nasty business. The query result only returns nodes for each of which you still have to manually go through all of its properties to find the desired one. Alex&apos; approach is much cleaner here as a quick glance at &lt;tt&gt;IdentifierManager#getReferences&lt;/tt&gt; shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding not being able to access the hidden back reference property I don&apos;t think we should promote access to the underlying node state to the Tree API as this would break encapsulation. What about not hiding this property? We could automatically add a mixin (e.g. oak:references) to referenceable nodes, which declares such back references as a protected property.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13822710" author="tripod" created="Thu, 14 Nov 2013 18:16:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;making the property visible is problematic in respect to access control. for example if the session does not have read access to one of the source nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with jukka, that it would be cleaner, if the query can use the special reference property index. this also has the advantage that for rare cases, where a user query includes such clauses will be faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;sidenote&lt;/b&gt;: please don&apos;t use static imports - or at least not for methods. they make the code rather difficult to read, especially outside a IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;-            &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; PathUtils.concat(parentId, tree.getName());
+            &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; concat(parentId, tree.getName());
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13822775" author="alex.parvulescu" created="Thu, 14 Nov 2013 19:04:50 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;making the property visible is problematic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with this part, making it visible only introduces more trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with jukka, that it would be cleaner, if the query can use the special reference property index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that this &apos;special reference property index&apos; doesn&apos;t exist. We might need to tweak the query code a lot to allow for this type of mechanism to work properly and I&apos;m wondering if the benefits outweigh the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was considering bootstrapping in some way a property index on top of that hidden node state, but looking at the &lt;em&gt;PropertyIndexLookup&lt;/em&gt; it also works with _NodeState_s, so we&apos;d still have the issue of extracting the NodeState from a Tree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see a way forward based on queries, other than adding yet another query index impl that would only handle references, but I&apos;m open to more detailed suggestions if you have them &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;please don&apos;t use static imports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, but I&apos;d much rather keep the current style, I like my code short and sweet. We could pick this up on the dev list though.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;ve reached a point where I can&apos;t really cut a line between the 2 issues anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version introduces a query index by popular demand &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
It looks like it&apos;s working ok, the upside should be that if we disable this index traversal will be used. The previous version had no way of extracting a NodeState from the Tree so this is cleaner in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also changes the storage structure to a tree, same stuff as the property index (same storage strategy classes with minor tweaks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the sucky parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&apos;ve managed to hit &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-182&quot; title=&quot;Support for &amp;quot;invisible&amp;quot; internal content&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;OAK-182&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;OAK-182&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; : child node count fails to exclude hidden nodes. Yes, now the node has hidden children and they break the session export tests. I&apos;ve hacked in a work-around but it&apos;s probably not pretty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve also hit &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-1192&quot; title=&quot;NPE in Versioning when a Node has a hidden child node&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;OAK-1192&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;OAK-1192&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, (lucky me), a NPE in the versioning bits, there&apos;s something wrong there but I can&apos;t really tell what it is, so unfortunately no dirty hacks included to get the tests passing.&lt;br/&gt;
So fair warning not all tests pass because of this NPE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version should help us reach consensus sooner, I think I&apos;ve managed to incorporate everybody&apos;s opinion, if I left something out, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback needed, please mind the failing tests, this is still a WIP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with not using a query is how to extract the NodeState from the Tree. It does look like bootstrapping a lite query engine (just the lookup parts really) is in the end cheaper, but all query related bits work on NodeStates.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13825428" author="mduerig" created="Mon, 18 Nov 2013 16:07:18 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Right, I&apos;m fine with that. Maybe the query engine could support us at getting the property? I discussed this with &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=thomasm&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;thomasm&quot;&gt;thomasm&lt;/a&gt; way back when I first implemented this and he was opposed. Maybe we can revisit that now!?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13825453" author="alex.parvulescu" created="Mon, 18 Nov 2013 16:39:28 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Actually I think you could include the properties with the ReferenceIndex - right now I&apos;m stripping them  away. &lt;br/&gt;
The problem is that changing this behavior will break compatibility with the TraversingIndex which doesn&apos;t include the properties. What we&apos;d have now is a compatible behavior between the 2 cases: reference index and no index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m wondering if we could settle this with a flag on the IdentifierManager, &apos;resolveProperties&apos;, seems a basic solution but I see no other way of identifying the source of the results (ReferenceIndex vs TraversingIndex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m also wondering if we&apos;re not taking this too far. Do we really need to worry about property lookup at this point? We went from full repository traversal to a bunch of properties traversal (in the case where the name of the reference property is not known).&lt;br/&gt;
So far I haven&apos;t seen any benchmarks related to this, should we set something up?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
