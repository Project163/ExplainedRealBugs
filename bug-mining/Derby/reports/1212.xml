            <title>[DERBY-3098] LOB locks are not released after free().</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3098</link>
                <project id="10594" key="DERBY">Derby</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;When getBlob/getClob is called on the ResultSet, the current row is&lt;br/&gt;
locked if the JDBC driver does not cache the entire LOB value in&lt;br/&gt;
memory.  This is done to prevent the Blob/Clob object from being&lt;br/&gt;
changed.  Until now, this lock has been held to the end of the&lt;br/&gt;
transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JDBC4 introduced free() methods for the Blob/Clob class.  The locking&lt;br/&gt;
should be changed so that the locks is releases when the Blob/Clob&lt;br/&gt;
object is freed.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="12532035" author="oysteing" created="Wed, 3 Oct 2007 08:11:30 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The attached patch, derby-3098fix.diff, fixes the locking.  This patch&lt;br/&gt;
is not intended for commit since tests should be added first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explanation of the patch: By using READ COMMITTED instead of&lt;br/&gt;
REPEATABLE READ the locking will not be associated with the&lt;br/&gt;
transaction, but with the BaseContainerHandle. Since we use a handle&lt;br/&gt;
that we get from reopening the container, we get control over when the&lt;br/&gt;
locks are released.  The is closed when the stream is closed, or at&lt;br/&gt;
the end of the transaction at the latest.  (During termination of the&lt;br/&gt;
transaction, close will be called on all container handles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also updated the comments to reflect this new implementation.&lt;br/&gt;
I must admit I did not quite understand the discussion in the comment&lt;br/&gt;
around using the isolation level of the container, but given my&lt;br/&gt;
proposed solution, that discussion does not relevant, and I have&lt;br/&gt;
deleted it from the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to add the following tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Check that lock on row is released at free() if isolation level of&lt;br/&gt;
   transaction is READ COMMITTED.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Check that lock on row is not released at free() if isolation level&lt;br/&gt;
   of transaction is REPEATABLE READ.&lt;br/&gt;
3. Check that lock on row is released when transaction commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, speak up, if you think more tests are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch looks correct to me and the test plan also sounds good. I&apos;m just wondering how this works when the transaction isolation level is READ UNCOMMITTED. Will a reader have to wait if another transaction has locked a large lob exclusively, but not if the lob is small?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12532111" author="oysteing" created="Wed, 3 Oct 2007 13:49:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;My testing so far shows that the patch solves the problem for Blob, but it does not appear to do so for Clob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I run a simple test program that does getClob, it does not seem like OverflowInputStream is involved.&lt;br/&gt;
I will further investigate where the paths differ, but if anybody has an idea why Blob and Clob are handled differently, I welcome any ideas you may have.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12532113" author="oysteing" created="Wed, 3 Oct 2007 14:03:47 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;To Knut Anders question of READ UNCOMMITTED.  I have not tested it&lt;br/&gt;
yet, but I will add tests for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume we also for READ_UNCOMMITTED want the record of the Blob to&lt;br/&gt;
be locked since the Blob object should be stable regardless of&lt;br/&gt;
isolation level.  (I think this illustrate that locking the record is&lt;br/&gt;
not the best solution for guaranteeing stability, but creating a new&lt;br/&gt;
mechanism that allow more concurrency will be much more work.  More&lt;br/&gt;
work than I am willing to put into this.)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12532123" author="oysteing" created="Wed, 3 Oct 2007 14:24:19 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I was wrong about Clob not using OverflowInputStream.  It does.  (I&lt;br/&gt;
had an error in my test program so that it was fetching a Clob that&lt;br/&gt;
was not large enough for OverflowInputStream to come into play.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is that locks are not released after free() for&lt;br/&gt;
Clob.  I think the problem is that it is obtaining two sets of locks,&lt;br/&gt;
but only releasing one set.  My theory is that in the EmbedClob constructor,&lt;br/&gt;
both &lt;br/&gt;
     ((Resetable) storeStream).initStream();&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;
     this.clob = new StoreStreamClob(storeStream, this);&lt;br/&gt;
causes locks to be set.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12532415" author="oysteing" created="Thu, 4 Oct 2007 12:59:29 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Attached is new patch, derby-3098fix+tests.diff, that fixes the double&lt;br/&gt;
locking problem for Clobs and add tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EmbedClob no longer explicity initializes the stream since it will be&lt;br/&gt;
done when the StoreStreamClob object is created.  I also added a check&lt;br/&gt;
in OverflowInputStream to ensure that should a stream be initialized&lt;br/&gt;
several times, locking will only be peformed the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests has also been added. (Since free() is a JDBC 4 method, most test&lt;br/&gt;
cases had to be added to the JDBC 4 test suite, but I also added a&lt;br/&gt;
test case to BlobClob4Blob to check that locks are released at commit&lt;br/&gt;
if free() is not called.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this patch, jdbc4/ClobTest will fail with client/server since it&lt;br/&gt;
turns out that when Clob.free() is called on the client, this is not&lt;br/&gt;
propagated to the server, and the server-side Clob is not freed until&lt;br/&gt;
commit.  I will file a separate issue for that.&lt;/p&gt;
