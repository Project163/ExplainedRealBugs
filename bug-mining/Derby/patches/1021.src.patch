+DRDA_NoAuthentication.S=Network Server startup failed. User authentication must be enabled before the Network Server installs a security manager. You must either enable user authentication or disable the installation of a security manager. For information on enabling user authentication, see the section of the Derby Developer's Guide entitled "Working with user authentication". Disabling the installation of a security manager is strongly discouraged in a client/server environment. However, if you must do this, you can disable the installation of a security manager by specifying the "-noSecurityManager" command line option when you bring up the Network Server.
