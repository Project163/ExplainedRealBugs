 While this bug has been fixed in Mac OS X 10.4, please be aware that
 Derby applications that may be deployed on Mac OS X 10.3 will need the
 workaround described above to create or modify a Derby database.

+NOTE: A workaround for this issue has been committed to versions of
+Derby from 10.1.2.0 onward. It is not necessary to set the
+derby.storage.fileSyncTransactionLog property for versions of Derby
