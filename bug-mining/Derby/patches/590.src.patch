+<P> This document describes some aspects of the Derby Example and demo database toursdb. 
+<H2><FONT SIZE="5">2. Purpose of the database toursdb</FONT></H2>
+<P>The toursdb is provided as an example and demo database to illustrate some functionality of the Derby RDBMS. Many of the examples in the Derby documentation use tables that exist in the toursdb database. 
+<P>The toursdb database is created, and can be recreated using the files in &lt;your derby install directory&gt;/demo/programs if you have an installation that includes these. 
+<P>The built database is placed in &lt;your derby install directory&gt;/demo/databases. 
+<H2><FONT SIZE="5">3. The toursdb schema</FONT></H2>
+<P>The toursdb schema is the default schema, 'APP'. 
+<P>The toursdb tables are: 
+<BR>(Note: in the following table no description is given where the columnname is deemed to be explanation enough.) <BR CLEAR="LEFT">
