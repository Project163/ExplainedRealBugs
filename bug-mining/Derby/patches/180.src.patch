-Changes in Derby 10.0.2.1
+Changes in Derby 10.2
     
- *) For Network Server, clear back to appropriate point if
-    query fails instead of clearing buffer. (Derby-5)
-    [Army Brown <army@golux.com>]
-
- *) Enable use of functions in triggers (Derby-6)
-    [Jack Klebanoff <klebanof@mutagen.net>] 
-
- *) Triggers do not evaluate functions in VALUES trigger actions. (Derby-14)
-    
- *) Method calls on a closed Connection from a PooledConnection no
-    longer cause connection closed events to be sent to any listeners.
-    Minor clean up of BrokeredConnection as well, remove an unused
-    constructor, make the control field final and remove incorrect
-    comment and unused imports. (Derby-24)
-    [Dan Debrunner <djd@debrunners.com>]
-    
- *) Connection.close() on a closed connection is defined by JDBC
-    javadoc to be a no-op. (Derby-30)
-    [Dan Debrunner]
-    
- *) Multiple jvms prevented from booting the same database in parallel
-    to avoid accidental corruptions in Unix environments. (Derby-32)
-    [Suresh Thalamati <tsuresh@source-zone.org>]
-    
- *) Allow default to be specified for CHAR FOR BIT DATA columns
-    (Derby-34)
-    [Satheesh Bandaram <satheesh@sourcery.org>]
-
- *) Fix dss chaining problems for network server. (Derby-35)
-    [Army Brown]
-    
- *) LOCKS is no longer a reserved keyword (Derby-38)
-    [Mamta Satoor <mamta@remulak.net>]
-
- *) Allow BIGINT default values in create table. (Derby-40)
-    [Satheesh Bandaram]
-
- *) Encryption key length no longer stored in
-    service.properties. (Derby-42)
-    [Sunitha Kambhampati <skambha@Yngvi.Org>]
-
- *) Enable LIKE ? ESCAPE ? syntax that was disabled before (Derby-44)
-    [Satheesh Bandaram]
-
- *) Allow expressions that result in string types as arguments to a
-    LIKE expression (Derby-45)
-    [Satheesh Bandaram]
-
- *) Make RETAIN a non-reserved keyword (Derby-54)
-    [Satheesh Bandaram]
-    
- *) Faster create database by moving DatabaseMetaData SPS creation
-    into the DataDictionary. Means creation of these statements is not
-    logged and compilation is delayed until the matching
-    DatabaseMetaData method is first called.
-    [Dan Debrunner]
-    
- *) dblook argument handling has been improved. Bad arguments now
-    generate an error, and connection URLs in quotes are handled
-    properly.
-    [Jalud Abdulmenan <tendi@rogers.com>]
-    
- *) Localization of dblook messages enabled.
-    [Satheesh Bandaram]
-    
- *) Extension Packaging:
-       1. The monitor is changed to read multiple module.properties
-          files, using method ClassLoader.getSystemResources.
-       2. The monitor reads sub-sub-protocol properties from the
-          modules.properties files, instead of just the system
-          properties.
-       3. Sub-sub-protocol property values can name either a
-          StorageFactory or a PersistentService
-          implementation. Previously it could only name a
-          StorageFactory implementation.
-    [Jack Klebanoff]
-
- *) Latent bug fixed in
-    org.apache.derby.impl.store.access.sort.ExternalSortFactory.  Its
-    canSupport method throws an exception if it is called with a null
-    startParams argument.
-    [Jack Klebanoff]
-    
- *) Prevent empty log switches by rechecking the conditions that
-    trigger the log switched in synchronized blocks, and make backward
-    scans skip the empty log files. In multi-threaded application when
-    many threads are executing commits in parallel, empty log files
-    might be created.  Recovery log scan does not expect empty log
-    files while scanning log records to undo incomplete transactions.
-    [Suresh Thalamati] 
-    
- *) Add derby.war file
-    [Kathey Marsden <kmarsden@sourcery.org>]
-    
- *) Fix display of NetServlet messages. 
-    [Lynh Nguyen <lynhnn@remulak.net>]
-
- *) Database Metadata now returns correct size for maximum column name
-    length, maximum schema name length, etc.
-    [Satheesh Bandaram]
-
- *) Add static property derby.drda.keepAlive to Network Server, to set
-    the use of TCP keepalive for Network Server connections on the
-    server side, with the use of keepalive on by default.
-    [Kathey Marsden]
-
- *) Ensure BrokeredStatement and PreparedStatement always throw a
-    Statement is closed exception if the statement is closed.
-    [Dan Debrunner]
+ *) The Network Server no longer prints the message "Connection Number: N"
+    to the console unless derby.drda.logConnections is set to true (DERBY-569)
+    [ Bryan Pendleton ]
