-Test to reproduce DERBY-5624, An expanding update fails with an nospc.U error.
+Test to reproduce DERBY-5624, a recursion during DropOnCommit causes out
+of stack space for operations that generate a lot of objects to be dropped
+at commit time. 
+
+This test reproduces the problem by creating a table with 1000 columns, then
+an index on each of those columns, loads some data and then call compress
+will drop and recreate each of those indexes.  At commit time each index
+drop will have registered itself onto the Observer list for processing at
+commit time.  Before fix this would fail with out of disk space in at least
+XP, ibm16 default jvm configuration.
