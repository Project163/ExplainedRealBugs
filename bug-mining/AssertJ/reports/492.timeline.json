Thanks for quick response and workaround. \r\n\r\nI think it's not a good idea to include all primitive types to check against string but definitely worth enum comparison with string but I'll leave that to assertj team to decide and agree upon.

I wanted to add another vote for supporting enum/string comparison as it's a fairly common use case. Currently this requires `withEqualsForFields`, as suggested above, which can get a little verbose if there are many enums:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(entity)\r\n        .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n        .withEqualsForFields((String s, PhoneType t) -> PhoneType.valueOf(s) == t, \"phones.phoneType\")\r\n        .withEqualsForFields((String s, AddressType t) -> AddressType.valueOf(s) == t, \"addresses.addressType\")\r\n        // etc..\r\n        .isEqualTo(dto);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this was supported OOTB via an option, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(entity)\r\n        .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n        .withEnumStringComparison()\r\n
