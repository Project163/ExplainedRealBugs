quick question regarding the expected ordering. Given the following input which is found in the test `[\"Merry\", \"Frodo\", null, null, \"Merry\", \"Sam\", \"Frodo\"]`, there are two possible ways to return the duplicates in order:\r\n1. `[\"Merry\", \"Frodo\", null]`\r\n2. `[null, \"Merry\", \"Frodo\"]`\r\nOption 1 starts with the first elements that is a duplicate, while the second starts with the first duplicated element. I think they are both valid in their own way, like for debugging purpose, option 2 tells me null is the first duplicated element, which I think is helpful, while option one seems like the natural way.\r\nI know @ranjitshinde91 implementation is based on 1. above, checking if option 2 can be

honestly, I had not even thought about that until you asked. I think I would be fine with both. The question of which one would be more nice for setting a breakpoint afterwards also depends, on whether I as the developer consider the first duplicate wrong (e.g. the first Merry should not have been added to begin with), or the second one.

variant.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1890928452/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Bananeweizen","id":406876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjg3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/406876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen","html_url":"https://github.com/Bananeweizen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bananeweizen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1890943878","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3331#issuecomment-1890943878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3331","id":1890943878,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5wtYOG","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-14T12:49:00Z","updated_at":"2024-01-14T12:49:00Z","body":"@kulgan
