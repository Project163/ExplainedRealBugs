     - Resolved ambiguity in error messages when a subsequence element is repeated in the expectation but not in the actual string.\r\n      - Refactored `assertContainsSubsequence` to handle different subsequence scenarios.\r\n      - Improved error handling by introducing `handleNotFound` to distinctly report missing elements and discrepancies in expected duplicates.\r\n      - Enhanced `getNotFoundSubsequence` to correctly compute and return missing or inadequately represented subsequences.\r\n\r\n      This change ensures clearer and more accurate failure messages when asserting string subsequences.\r\n\r\n#### Check List:\r\n* Fixes #3159 \r\n* Unit tests : YES\r\n* Javadoc with a code example (on API only) : NO \r\n* PR meets the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nFollowing the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) will make it easier for us to review and accept your PR.\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\n\r\nThe core assertContainsSubsequence method has undergone a significant overhaul to better cater to a broader range of subsequence scenarios. The driving force behind this refactoring is twofold:\r\n\r\n- Enhanced Subsequence Handling:\r\n\r\n    The refactoring ensures that the method can adeptly handle cases where there might be duplicate subsequences present. The essence of this handling lies in distinguishing between two different situations:\r\n        Where the actual string contains the subsequence but not as many times as the subsequence array dictates.\r\n        Where the actual string doesn't contain a particular subsequence at all.\r\n\r\n- Introduction of handleNotFound Method:\r\n\r\n    A fresh method, handleNotFound, has been extracted to specifically address the nuances of missing subsequences. A core task of this new method is:\r\n        To scrutinize whether missing subsequences arise because the actual string didn't cater to the repeated instances as specified by the subsequence array.\r\n\r\n- Behavioural Precedence:\r\n\r\nIn instances where at least one subsequence is completely absent from the actual string, this missing subsequence takes precedence over any discrepancies in the count of other subsequences. As illustrated in the example:\r\n```\r\nString actual = \"Yoda\";\r\nString[] subsequence = { \"Yo\", \"da\", \"Han\", \"Foo\" };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will yield the same output as:\r\n```\r\nString actual = \"Yoda\";\r\nString[] subsequence = { \"Yo\", \"da\", \"Han\", \"Foo\" , \"da\"};\r\n```\r\nEven though \"da\" appears twice in the latter example, the predominant error message would be about the absence of the strings \"Han\" and \"Foo\" in the actual string. This decision was made to ensure that the most pertinent errors (complete absence) are flagged prior to counting discrepancies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10258483731,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs5vXp9vzwAAAAJjdAoT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/10258483731","actor":{"login":"JohnBryte","id":50146978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTQ2OTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50146978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnBryte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0991c707c42bd6d991b200d1bbf490403da5bf81","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JohnBryte/assertj/commits/0991c707c42bd6d991b200d1bbf490403da5bf81","created_at":"2023-09-01T15:18:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1708955746","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3159#issuecomment-1708955746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3159","id":1708955746,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5l3Jhi","user":{"login":"JohnBryte","id":50146978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTQ2OTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50146978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnBryte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnBryte/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-06T19:19:37Z","updated_at":"2023-09-06T19:19:37Z","body":"The issue has been resolved on my end.
