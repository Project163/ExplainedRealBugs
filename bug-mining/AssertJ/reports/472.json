Does it really make sense to collect **private** methods from a class? What would be the purpose of such an assert? I can easily imagine that new private methods can be added to `java.lang.Object` in the future, so the very same `should_fail_if_no_methods_are_expected_and_methods_are_available` would start failing again. The worse is that every user of `assertHasMethods` would have to exclude all those \"Object.wait0 private methods\".  \r\n\r\nIn case you wonder, `wait0` is declared as following: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/73ba7fdce838ba8a2c227a972c176311e6cc0b41/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/Object.java#L377-L378\r\n\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nLaunch `Classes_assertHasMethods_Test.should_fail_if_no_methods_are_expected_and_methods_are_available` with `java 19-ea`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
