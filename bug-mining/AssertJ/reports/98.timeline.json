based on existing code. I modeled it on FileAssert. In fact I saw nothing related to anything java.nio.file in the code, so I created it from scratch...\n\nPreview only. I know the coding style does not fit; knowing that I use IDEA, do you happen to have a style file available?\n\nAlso, about error messages: there seem to be a lot of factories; FileAssert seems to basically use one per message! Is that on purpose? Can I create a single factory for Path-specific operations (including exists, non exists and absolute)?\n\nPlease comment!
