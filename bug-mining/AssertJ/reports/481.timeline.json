Check List:\r\n* Fixes #2697 \r\n* Unit tests :  Yes (edited existing ones).\r\n* Javadoc with a code example (on API only) :  NA\r\n* PR meets the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nFollowing the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) will make it easier for us to review and accept your  #PR.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\nCalling a new failure method inside Iterables that eventually invokes assertionFailedError from AssertionErrorCreator with the expected and actual values needed for the \"Click to see difference\" feature when AssertionFailedError is thrown. \r\n\r\nAlso made modifications on Iterables_assertContainsExactly_tests to call the same failure method.\r\n\r\n**New changes:**\r\n\r\nImplementation for arrays.\r\n\r\n* Rewritten array tests to make sure they call the right failure method.\r\n* assertContainsExactly calls failure method with actual and expected values.\r\n* Actual and expected values are converted to a list when the failure method is called so they show the right values when the \r\n  toString method is called under water.\r\n* The click to see differences feature will show the actual and expected values side by side.\r\n* Fixing format at Iterables.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\n**Old:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113503359/198300776-927418dd-c87c-4695-a880-3a5dedde2afb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**New:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113503359/198299596-58c647a2-5dce-412d-ad27-25ce1ec84b9e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2824/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7745005623,"node_id":"CE_lADOAIX3Vs5NBpbHzwAAAAHNo2g3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/7745005623","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"3bda0ee52a809fb2b449b4c577b1398e7ddebe7e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/commits/3bda0ee52a809fb2b449b4c577b1398e7ddebe7e","created_at":"2022-11-05T05:11:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11610441184,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs5NBpbHzwAAAAK0CUXg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/11610441184","actor":{"login":"schlosna","id":54594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna","html_url":"https://github.com/schlosna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3bda0ee52a809fb2b449b4c577b1398e7ddebe7e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schlosna/assertj-core/commits/3bda0ee52a809fb2b449b4c577b1398e7ddebe7e","created_at":"2024-01-26T15:56:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
