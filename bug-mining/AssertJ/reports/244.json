MapAsserts.allSatisfy()\r\n\r\nI believe currently this is missing for assertions like:\r\n```\r\nEmployee emperor = new Employee(2L, new Name(\"Sheev\", \"Palpatine\"), 26);\r\nMap<String, Company> customerMap = Maps.newHashMap(\"imperium\",\r\n            new Company(Arrays.asList(emperor), \"imperium\", null));\r\n\r\n    assertThat(customerMap)\r\n            .allSatisfy((name, customer) ->

map entries:\r\n```\r\nassertThat(customerMap.entrySet())\r\n            .allSatisfy(entry -> {\r\n              assertThat(entry.getKey()).isNotBlank();\r\n

`map.allSatisfy((name, customer) -> { assertThat(customer)` is easier to read than `map.entrySet().allSatisfy(entry ->
