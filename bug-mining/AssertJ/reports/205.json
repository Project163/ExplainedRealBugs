suggested by @joel-costigliola in https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/pull/645#issuecomment-223801634 :\n\n> [...] [I] realized that there is no support for registering specific field/type comparators (as mentioned in the existing javadoc), for completion and consistency we should add it.\n> \n> Adding `usingComparatorElementForType` and `usingComparatorForElementField` methods in `AbstractIterableAssert` and using the registered comparators in `FieldByFieldComparator` should solve this problem I believe .
