I never circled back to comment on this issue...\r\n\r\nI think the main difference between my original suggestion and @filiphr 's proposal is the backing structure - I was proposing a HashMap for O(1) lookup, and @filiphr is proposing a simple collection for O(n) lookup. Given that n is likely to be very small, I can't imagine a massive performance gain by using a hash, so I'm comfortable with @filiphr 's suggestion as being (probably) simpler to implement and maintain. But also, both proposals could work with the same API design for custom representations, so it would be easy to switch to a hash-based lookup in the future in the unlikely event that it was necessary to do so for performance.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/820871365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kriegfrj","id":7224087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7224087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegfrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4602535191,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYwMjUzNTE5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/4602535191","actor":{"login":"filiphr","id":6012094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTIwOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6012094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr","html_url":"https://github.com/filiphr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-16T02:55:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4602535193,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2MDI1MzUxOTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/4602535193","actor":{"login":"filiphr","id":6012094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTIwOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6012094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr","html_url":"https://github.com/filiphr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-16T02:55:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/821999648","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2048#issuecomment-821999648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2048","id":821999648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTk5OTY0OA==","user":{"login":"yiruihe","id":48916192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTE2MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48916192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe","html_url":"https://github.com/yiruihe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiruihe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-18T14:24:14Z","updated_at":"2021-04-18T14:24:14Z","body":"Hi! I have considered a possible solution these days. I used `Map` to store different `Representations`. \r\nTo start with, I am a beginner. I will be so pleased if you can give me some suggestions! 😊\r\nFirst, I think the method `String unambiguousToStringOf(Object object)` from the ''org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation.java'' is no longer needed since I can implement various of `Representations` in the class `CompositeRepresentation`. (But I am not sure whether this method can be deleted.)\r\n\r\nAnd according to the idea of [@filiphr](https://github.com/filiphr) and [@kriegfrj](https://github.com/kriegfrj), a new ideas formed. The code is generally showing below.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class CompositeRepresentation implements Representation{\r\n  protected Map<String, Representation> representations;\r\n  \r\n/*Initialize the CompositeRepresentation according to a certain correspondence of the \"name of representation\" and \"representation\" itself.*/\r\n  public CompositeRepresentation(Map<String, Representation>
