the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen using a non-standard Java map where entries can be null, NPEs happen when assertJ tries to generate failure messages representing the map content.\r\n\r\nNote that Map code allowing null map entries in `.entrySet()` are probably buggy, but I cannot tell if it really break a contract.\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.assertj.core.presentation.StandardRepresentation.toStringOf(StandardRepresentation.java:491)\r\n\tat org.assertj.core.presentation.StandardRepresentation.toStringOf(StandardRepresentation.java:236)\r\n\tat org.assertj.core.presentation.CompositeRepresentation.toStringOf(CompositeRepresentation.java:40)\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.24.2\r\n* java version: 8\r\n* test framework version: Junit4\r\n* os (if relevant): Ubuntu\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n```\r\npublic class NullEntryMapTest {\r\n\r\n    static class NullEntryMap<K, V> extends ConcurrentHashMap<K, V> {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Set<Entry<K, V>> entrySet() {\r\n            Set<Map.Entry<K, V>> set = new HashSet<>();\r\n            set.add(null);\r\n            return set;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testStandardRepresentationWithNullEntryMap() {\r\n        StandardRepresentation.STANDARD_REPRESENTATION.toStringOf(new NullEntryMap<>());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testContains() {\r\n        assertThat(new NullEntryMap<>()).containsKey(\"foo\"); // actual assertion does not matter\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix, StandardRepresentation should check the entry is not null.\r\nIt might be good to also check other occurences of entry.getKey() /entry.getValue() in the code.\r\n\r\nI notice IntelliJ as an example handles this case in it's representation of maps.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3087/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
