Feature summary\nProvide a built‐in mechanism so that when one asserts on sub‐properties (mostly via `satisfies`/`assertWith`), the failure message always includes the root object under test. This avoids repetition (.as(...)) in all sub-property assertions or having to maintain some other custom code to add the root object.\n\n#### Example\nHere’s what the usage could look like:\n\n```kt\n// Somewhere in test setup, enable this mode globally\nAssertions.enableRootObjectInFailureMessages()\n\n// Then in tests:\nassertWith(fullArticle, { fullArticle ->\n    // if any of these fails, message includes fullArticle\n    assertThat(fullArticle).isNotNull\n    assertThat(fullArticle!!.article).isNotNull\n    assertThat(fullArticle.article.manuallyDiscarded).isTrue\n    assertThat(fullArticle.article.status).isEqualTo(ArticleStatus.DISCARDED)\n    assertThat(fullArticle.article.discardReason).isEqualTo(DiscardReason.MANUAL_DISCARD)\n})\n```\n\nThen the failure message might look something like this:\n```\norg.assertj.core.error.AssertJMultipleFailuresError: \nFor FullArticle(article=Article(status=FAILED, manuallyDiscarded=true, discardReason=...))\nMultiple Failures (1 failure)\n-- failure 1 --\nexpected: DISCARDED\n but was: FAILED\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3948/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
