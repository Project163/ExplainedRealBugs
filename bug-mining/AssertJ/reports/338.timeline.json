to #1656 -- here are the changes that made AssertJ Core compile with Java 9+, including the module descriptor.\r\n\r\n- Added the \"base\" source root `/src/main/java` to the compilation set of the `java9+` profile.\r\n- Encountered a lot of \"invisible package\" errors...\r\n- ...and added a bunch of `requires ...;` statements to fix those. Left some comments in the `module-info.java` file.\r\n\r\nOpen ends:\r\n- [ ] Delete/ignore all Java-9+ compiled classes, except for `module-info.class`\r\n- [x] `java.instrument` is a special snow flake, it's not required directly to compile AssertJ Core, but ByteBuddy seems to need it. @raphw ... any new input here? (removed in 116798b15518f16597e8754b83c06cd3b89ebe24)\r\n- [x] Module `java.sql` is only(?) needed due to a link reference in the javadoc of `Assertions.java` (not needed since 5c136d6268a6e0c375c6d6ae266c6a6e2b2b0c6d)\r\n- [x] Module name `junit` is file named based -- JUnit 4.13 will fix this, though. (fixed in b0385fcf6459bb1a5ddb1c2783dc7dc6c054df30)\r\n- [x] Module name `jsr305` is file name based -- don't see a fix in the near future, do you? (not needed since 24176f5450b8e3624a819fdc594f709a378ca09f)\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] Provide integration test that uses module `org.assertj.core` on the module path.\r\n- [ ] Run `jdeps --check ...`,

to #1711, this introduces a skeleton for modular integration testing based on the `maven-invoker-plugin`. As an initial test case I chose the issue reported in #1656: it fails correctly when the test runs in the IDE, but it doesn't fail when executed by the invoker plugin.\r\n\r\nOpen points:\r\n- [ ] Understand why `issue_1656()` doesn't fail under `maven-invoker-plugin`\r\n- [ ] Allow the IDE to automatically detect the project generated by the plugin, maybe `build-helper-maven-plugin`? (for now I manually added `assertj-core/target/it/modular-tests` to the project modules)\r\n- [ ] Replace AssertJ 3.14.0 version with `@project.version@` in the integration test POM (the IDE is currently not able to detect the AssertJ module with the parameterized version and the test build fails -- I still need to try if the changes in #1711 can help)\r\n \r\n@sormuras please check it! This follows more your [Testing In The Modular World](https://sormuras.github.io/blog/2018-09-11-testing-in-the-modular-world.html) rather than the [mainrunner](https://github.com/sormuras/mainrunner)+[Bach](https://github.com/sormuras/bach) combo you suggested in #1711, I need a bit more time to understand how the latter works 😅
