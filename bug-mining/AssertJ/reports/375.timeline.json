a bug around enum values, there was an improvement in 3.15.0 with https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/1691 but if only works if the fields are both enums or if the expected field is one.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that actual enum field are not compared by value straight away, they are considered as complex objects and the recursive comparison looks for their fields since you have instructed it to ignore overridden equals but enum don't have fields so they are basically ignored since there is nothing left to compare.\r\n\r\nThe fix will consist in treating enums as types to
