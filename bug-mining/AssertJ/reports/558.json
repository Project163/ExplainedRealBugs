Feature summary\r\n\r\nPretty much the title, I would find it very convenient to be able to simple exclude fields based on their modifier, such as `transient` in my current use case, but why not any given set of modifiers?\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nCould be as in title, or something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(actual).usingRecursiveComparison().ignoringFieldsWithModifiers(int modifiers);\r\n```\r\nThis could be the same structure of `int` that `java.lang.reflect.Modifier` takes.\r\n\r\nJust an idea, and seems straightforward.
