Summary\r\n\r\nI have two types, an entity and a DTO, and they have a field called 'status', which are of different types but otherwise have identical constants. When using:\r\n\r\n    assertThat(entity)\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .ignoringAllOverriddenEquals()\r\n            .isEqualTo(dto)\r\n\r\ndifferences between the enum fields are not reported. I debugged a bit and turns out the 'equals' method is ignored for the fields (correctly, as I used 'ignoringAllOverriddenEquals') and they are attempted to be compared recursively again (i.e. their fields). There are no fields in these enums, so the difference is not reported at all.\r\n\r\nIgnoring equals is not taken into account for Java types (https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/blob/master/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/api/recursive/comparison/RecursiveComparisonConfiguration.java#L361)\r\n\r\nMaybe a similar exception should be made for enums, i.e. enums should be compared by using their name? Even if there are custom fields in the enums, the name check should be enough?","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
