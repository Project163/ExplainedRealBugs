one is tricky, as you pointed out the cause is how we deal with visited nodes, we compare them **without** evaluating the field location to be able to track potential cycles. Take for example a `Person` class with a `neighbor` field, it results in a cycle when comparing them: John has Tim as neighbor, Tim has John, but when looking at `Tim.neighbor` we fall back to John, if we evaluate it we cycle back falling in an infinite recursion.\r\n\r\nTo detect visited nodes, we compare them by reference, if we check the node location your test succeeds but the cycle detection does not work anymore, the `Person` example  `Tim.neighbor` refers to `John` but the location is different from the `John` root object (location is `neighbor`)\r\n\r\nYour test actually succeeds if we build the datastores object with new instances of `data1`, `data2` and `data3` because the visited nodes detection will find the references are different, try this with:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  private static DataStore createDataStore(boolean reverse) {\r\n    DataStore dataStore = new DataStore();\r\n    dataStore.store1.addAll(reverse ? list(new Data(\"987\"), new Data(\"456\"), new Data(\"123\"))\r\n        : list(new Data(\"123\"), new Data(\"456\"), new Data(\"987\")));\r\n    dataStore.store2.addAll(reverse ? list(new Data(\"987\"), new Data(\"456\")) : list(new Data(\"456\"), new Data(\"987\")));\r\n    return dataStore;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving said that, it would be great to support both your use case and the cycle detection but I'm not sure if this is possible, I need to do think about it more. Comparing unordered collection increases the likeliness of the issue as it requires comparing all elements to all expected elements (cross product) leading to duplicate dual values when both collections share the same elements.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1500942061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8971675435,"node_id":"CE_lADOAIX3Vs5eg6pDzwAAAAIWwOcr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/8971675435","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"8379cac6fa83229b5ff0d516ccb1114096700816","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/commits/8379cac6fa83229b5ff0d516ccb1114096700816","created_at":"2023-04-11T10:00:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1503033746","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2954#issuecomment-1503033746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2954","id":1503033746,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5ZlnmS","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-11T10:03:19Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T10:03:19Z","body":"@Soamid

Having one object in two collections usually is not a good model design, but that's another story and I have to live with it. :D ","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1503092593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Soamid","id":3297450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTc0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3297450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid","html_url":"https://github.com/Soamid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soamid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1503170722","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2954#issuecomment-1503170722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2954","id":1503170722,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5ZmJCi","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-11T11:40:01Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T11:40:37Z","body":"@Soamid  It would be great if you could check on your side that this was fixed properly, building assert is fairly straightforward (`mvn install` should do), then you can use the built snapshot version locally to run the unit tests.
