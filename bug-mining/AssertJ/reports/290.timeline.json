can try, yet I have a question:\r\n\r\nI tried to understand the actual code for `assertAllSatisfy` in `Maps` and it diverges from the `assertAllSatisfy` and `assertAnySatisfy` in `Iterables` (the latter aggregates the Information, the former simply fails with the delegated assertion). \r\n\r\n```java\r\nactual.entrySet().stream()\r\n          .forEach(entry -> entryRequirements.accept(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()));\r\n```\r\n\r\n`assertAnySatisfy` for `Maps` cannot be implemented similar to `assertAllSatisfy` in `Maps` since the method should return succesful if only one assertion is succesful (swallowing all failed assertions).
