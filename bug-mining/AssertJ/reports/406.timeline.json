Summary\r\n\r\nBased on #1621, extend the assertions API for arrays and iterables with a `satisfyExactly` method accepting multiple  `Consumer<? super ELEMENT>`s. \r\nThe tested collection must have the same size as the consumers. Each element of the tested collection is fed to the corresponding consumer.\r\n\r\nThe additional method would have the signature: \r\n```java\r\npublic final SELF satisfyExactly(Consumer<? super ELEMENT>... consumers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the method would be overloaded with an assert factory as first parameter and consumers operating not on the collection ELEMENT but on an assertion over that element (as suggested by @jbytecoder):\r\n```java\r\npublic final <A extends AbstractAssert<?, ELEMENT>> \r\nSELF satisfyExactly(Function<ELEMENT, A> assertFactory, Consumer<? super A>... consumers)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(trilogy).satisfyExactly(movie -> {\r\n    // the fellowship of the Ring\r\n    assertThat(movie.getReleaseDate()).isBefore(parse(\"2002-12-17\"));\r\n    assertThat(movie.xrated).isFalse();\r\n  }, \r\n  movie -> {\r\n    // the two Towers\r\n     assertThat(movie.getReleaseDate()).isEqualTo(parse(\"2002-12-18\"));\r\n     assertThat(movie.getTitle()).contains(\"Towers\");\r\n  }, \r\n  movie -> {\r\n    // the Return of the King\r\n    assertThat(movie.getTitle()).endsWith(\"King\");\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n\r\nassertThat(movieTitles).satisfyExactly(\r\n  Assertions::assertThat,\r\n  s -> s.contains(\"fellowship\"), \r\n  s -> s.endsWith(\"Towers\"), \r\n  s -> s.matches(\".* Return .* King\")\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue (and #2054) was split from #1621 as suggested by @joel-costigliola in
