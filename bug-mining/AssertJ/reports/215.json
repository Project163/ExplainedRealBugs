Summary\n\nWhen using `containsExactly` with double arrays and a given precision, assertions unexpectedly produce strange failures under `3.5.2`.\n#### Example\n\n``` java\nassertThat(new double[] {-1.71, -1.51})\n        .containsExactly(new double[] {-1.7, -1.6}, within(0.1));\n```\n\nfails with\n\n```\njava.lang.AssertionError: \nExpecting:\n  <[-1.71, -1.51]>\nto contain exactly (and in same order):\n  <[-1.7, -1.6]>\nbut some elements were not found:\n  <[]>\nand others were not expected:\n  <[-1.51]>\nwhen comparing values using 'double comparator at precision 0.1'\n```\n\nInstead, I would expect no failure, as `-1.71` is within `0.1` of `-1.7` and `-1.51` is within `0.1` of `-1.6`.\n#### Java 8 specific ?\n- YES : create Pull Request from the `master` branch\n- NO  : create Pull Request from the `2.x` branch\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
