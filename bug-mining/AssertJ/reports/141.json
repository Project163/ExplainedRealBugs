of Tuple fails, if I use byte[] as a parameter.\nSo, for example, such test will fails:\n**(1)**\n\n``` java\n  @Test\n  public void should_fail_if_tuple_contains_byte_array_primitive() {\n    Tuple tuple = new Tuple(\"1\".getBytes(), \"Name\");\n    assertThat(tuple).isEqualTo(new Tuple(\"1\".getBytes(), \"Name\"));\n  }\n```\n\nLet's suppose we have some class for testing:\n\n``` java\npublic class SinteticClass {\n\n    private byte[] pk;\n    private String name;\n\n    public SinteticClass(byte[] pk, String name) {\n        this.pk = pk;\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public byte[] getPk() {        return pk;    }\n    public String getName() {        return name;    }\n\n    public static List<SinteticClass> prepareTestList() {\n        SinteticClass item1 = new SinteticClass(\"1\".getBytes(), \"Foo\");\n        SinteticClass item2 = new SinteticClass(\"2\".getBytes(), \"Bar\");\n        SinteticClass item3 = new SinteticClass(\"3\".getBytes(), \"Baz\");\n\n        return Arrays.asList(item1, item2, item3);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd again, next test will fails:\n**(2)**\n\n``` java\n  @Test\n  public void should_fails_if_extract_tuple_from_list_of_sintetic_class_with_byte_array_and_string() {\n    List<SinteticClass> list = prepareTestList();\n    assertThat(list).hasSize(3).extracting(\"pk\", \"name\")\n            .contains(Tuple.tuple(\"1\".getBytes(), \"Foo\"))\n            .contains(Tuple.tuple(\"2\".getBytes(), \"Bar\"))\n            .contains(Tuple.tuple(\"3\".getBytes(), \"Baz\"));\n  }\n```\n\nBut NOT this one, this one will pass:\n**(3)**\n\n``` java\n  @Test\n  public void should_pass_if_extract_from_list_of_sintetic_class_with_separate_assertions() {\n    List<SinteticClass> list = prepareTestList();\n    assertThat(list).hasSize(3);\n    assertThat(list).extracting(\"pk\")\n            .contains(\"1\".getBytes(), \"2\".getBytes(), \"3\".getBytes());\n    assertThat(list).extracting(\"name\")\n            .contains(\"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Baz\");\n  }\n```\n\nOn my mind, the bottom of the problem, base on missing equals() for byte[].\nAnd instead of direct compare byte[] == byte[] we have to compare with, for example Arrays.equals();\n\nSo, for example, Tuple.equals() could be looks like this:\n\n``` java\n    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n        if (this == obj) return true;\n        if (obj == null) return false;\n        if (!(obj instanceof Tuple)) return false;\n        Tuple other = (Tuple) obj;\n        for (int i = 0; i < datas.size(); i++) {\n            Object item = datas.get(i);\n            Object item2 = other.datas.get(i);\n            boolean isEquals = (item instanceof byte[] && item2 instanceof byte[])\n                    ? Arrays.equals((byte[]) item, (byte[]) item2)\n                    : item.equals(item2);\n            if (!isEquals) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n```\n\nSo, if we do such changes in Tuple.equals, then test **(1)** and **(2)** will pass.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
