Feature summary\r\nGreetings and salutations,\r\n\r\n`RecursiveComparisonAssert` supports both plain string field names and regex'd field names with the methods `ignoringFields()` and `ignoringFieldsMatchingRegexes()`. However, I would like to have this possibility for the functionality in `withEqualsForFields()` as well.\r\n\r\nMy reason is simply that I'm asserting objects which has lists of objects in them, in several levels, and I can't find a way for that to work with `withEqualsForFields()` method.\r\n\r\nTL,DR: I would love it if there were a `withEqualsForFieldsMathingRegexes()` method in the `RecursiveComparisonAssert` class.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class PersonTest {\r\n\r\n    static final BiPredicate<OffsetDateTime, LocalDateTime> LOCAL_AND_OFFSET_KINDA_THE_SAME = \r\n        (v1, v2) -> v1.toLocalDateTime().isEqual(v2);\r\n    static final OffsetDateTime NOW = OffsetDateTime.now();\r\n\r\n    @Test void compareOneLevel() {\r\n        Person person = Person.builder().name(\"John Smith\").createdAt(NOW).build();\r\n        PersonDto personDto = PersonDto.builder().name(\"John Smith\").createdAt(NOW.toLocalDateTime()).build();\r\n\r\n        assertThat(person).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .withEqualsForFields(LOCAL_AND_OFFSET_KINDA_THE_SAME, \"createdAt\")\r\n            .isEqualTo(personDto);\r\n\r\n        // Test passes\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test void compareTwoLevels() {\r\n        Person person = Person.builder().name(\"John Smith\").createdAt(NOW).build();\r\n        person.setChildren(List.of(Person.builder().name(\"Jane Smith\").createdAt(NOW).build()));\r\n        PersonDto personDto = PersonDto.builder().name(\"John Smith\").createdAt(NOW.toLocalDateTime()).build();\r\n        personDto.setChildren(List.of(PersonDto.builder().name(\"Jane Smith\").createdAt(NOW.toLocalDateTime()).build()));\r\n\r\n        assertThat(person).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .withEqualsForFields(LOCAL_AND_OFFSET_KINDA_THE_SAME, \"createdAt\")\r\n            .isEqualTo(personDto);\r\n\r\n        // Test fails with the following message:\r\n        //\r\n        // field/property 'children[0].createdAt' differ:\r\n        // - actual value  : 2022-07-22T18:05:25.036489+01:00 (java.time.OffsetDateTime)\r\n        // - expected value: 2022-07-22T18:05:25.036489 (java.time.LocalDateTime)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Data\r\n@SuperBuilder\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\nclass Person {\r\n    private String name;\r\n    private List<Person> children;\r\n    private OffsetDateTime createdAt;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Data\r\n@SuperBuilder\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\nclass PersonDto {\r\n    private String name;\r\n    private List<PersonDto> children;\r\n    private LocalDateTime createdAt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
