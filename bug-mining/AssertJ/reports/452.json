Summary\r\n\r\nThe functionality was working fine in 3.19.0, it is failing with 3.21.0. The reason for the failure is that the `org.assertj.core.internal.Maps.assertContainsOnlyKeys` method changed the way it evaluates not expected keys, and it is now creating a clone of the original map. Creation of the new PersistentMap works fine, however the subsequent `putAll` method crashes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfailed to lazily initialize a collection, could not initialize proxy - no Session\r\norg.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection, could not initialize proxy - no Session\r\n\tat app//org.hibernate.collection.internal.AbstractPersistentCollection.throwLazyInitializationException(AbstractPersistentCollection.java:612)\r\n\tat app//org.hibernate.collection.internal.AbstractPersistentCollection.withTemporarySessionIfNeeded(AbstractPersistentCollection.java:218)\r\n\tat app//org.hibernate.collection.internal.AbstractPersistentCollection.initialize(AbstractPersistentCollection.java:591)\r\n\tat app//org.hibernate.collection.internal.PersistentMap.putAll(PersistentMap.java:224)\r\n\tat app//org.assertj.core.internal.Maps.clone(Maps.java:422)\r\n\tat app//org.assertj.core.internal.Maps.getNotExpectedKeys(Maps.java:394)\r\n\tat app//org.assertj.core.internal.Maps.assertContainsOnlyKeys(Maps.java:367)\r\n\tat app//org.assertj.core.internal.Maps.assertContainsOnlyKeys(Maps.java:350)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(hibernateObject.getLazyLoadedMapObject())\r\n    .containsOnlyKeys(DayOfWeek.TUESDAY, DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY, DayOfWeek.THURSDAY);\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
