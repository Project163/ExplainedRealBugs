this change has some positive and not so positive side effects.\n\nIt would be possible indeed to extend any exisiting Assert class and still have assertion chaining correct but this require non trivial generic definition.\n\nI have taken @dmitry-treskunov example to add a `BigDecimal` assertion : \n\n``` java\npublic class MyAbstractBigDecimalAssert<S extends MyAbstractBigDecimalAssert<S>> \n             extends AbstractBigDecimalAssert<S> {\n\n  protected MyAbstractBigDecimalAssert(BigDecimal actual, Class<S> selfType) {\n    super(actual, selfType);\n  }\n\n  public S isOne() {\n    if (actual != null && actual.compareTo(BigDecimal.ONE) != 0) {\n      failWithMessage(\"Expected BigDecimal to be one but was <%s>\", actual);\n    }\n    return myself;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI also added a non generic class to avoid warning in `MyProjectAssertions` entry point class:\n\n``` java\npublic class MyBigDecimalAssert extends MyAbstractBigDecimalAssert<MyBigDecimalAssert> {\n\n  protected MyBigDecimalAssert(BigDecimal actual) {\n    super(actual, MyBigDecimalAssert.class);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`MyProjectAssertions` extends the regular `Assertions` class : \n\n``` java\npublic class MyProjectAssertions extends Assertions {  \n  public static MyBigDecimalAssert assertThat(BigDecimal actual) {\n    return new MyBigDecimalAssert(actual);\n  }  \n}\n```\n\nOk, now I can write: \n\n``` java\nassertThat(BigDecimal.ONE).isNotZero().isOne();\n```\n\nNote that we start with a regular `BigDecimal` assertion from `AbstractBigDecimalAssert` and yet we can chain with the one from `MyAbstractBigDecimalAssert`, this is because \n`assertThat(BigDecimal.ONE)` has returned `AbstractBigDecimalAssert` and not `BigDecimalAssert`.\n\nStill with me ?  Now the not so good side effects, best explained with a String assertion example:\n\nSince `assertThat(\"Yoda\")` returns `AbstractCharSequenceAssert`, if we want to use `Condition`, we have to create a `Condition<AbstractCharSequenceAssert>`.\nSame thing apply with `usingComparator`, in the following code \n\n``` java\nassertThat(\"Frodo\").usingComparator(caseInsensitiveStringComparator).startsWith(\"fr\").endsWith(\"ODO\");\n```\n\n`caseInsensitiveStringComparator` is a `Comparator<CharSequence>`, not a `Comparator<String>`.\n\n_Conclusion open to discussion:_\n\nAlthough it works this is not super obvious for the end user ... I'm wondering if this addition is really worth it.

In `Assertions`, instead of \n\n```\npublic static AbstractCharSequenceAssert<?, ?> assertThat(String actual) {\n    return new StringAssert(actual);\n}\n```\n\n, change it to\n\n```\npublic static AbstractCharSequenceAssert<?, String> assertThat(String actual) {\n    return new StringAssert(actual);\n}\n```\n\nThen the examples you cited work the same as before.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/54980041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aruka-pragmatists","id":7138138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzgxMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7138138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists","html_url":"https://github.com/aruka-pragmatists","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruka-pragmatists/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":163115467,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTYzMTE1NDY3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/163115467","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-09T14:46:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":163115468,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2MzExNTQ2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/163115468","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-09T14:46:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/55037006","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/220#issuecomment-55037006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/220","id":55037006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDM3MDA2","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https:/
