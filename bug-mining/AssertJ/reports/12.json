assertions error message are single line which is not very handy in IDE, one must often copy the message in a text editor and reformat it to read it easily.\n\nLet's take the failing assertion below :  \n\n``` java\nDate date = parse(\"2002-12-18\");\nassertThat(date).isBefore(\"2002-12-10\");\n```\n\nIt leads to an assertion error with the following message in Eclipse :\n\n```\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<2002-12-18T00:00:00> to be strictly before:<2002-12-10T00:00:00>\n```\n\nBut it would be more readable if it were multiline like this
