the bug**\r\n\r\nKotlin compilation fails with `Not enough information to infer type variable T`\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.23.1\r\n* Java version: 11\r\n* Kotlin: 1.7.21\r\n\r\nIt looks like the only reason for adding a return type to `fail` was to use the failure in `Optional.orElseGet`, however, I believe that usage is NOT justified: https://github.com/assertj/assertj/commit/ce2dcef5ba64bb878aaa05339dc306767bb3d807\r\n\r\nThe same goes for soft assertions: return type was added with no justification in https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2094\r\n\r\nI believe, for `Optional`, a much better usage would be `orElseThrow(Supplier<? extends X> exceptionSupplier)`.\r\n\r\nSo I think it would be better to have:\r\n1) A fixed return type like `Error` rather than `<T> T` for regular assertions\r\n2) `void` return type for `SoftAssertion`. In other words, I believe 820d2927c11e0ddcd371c9de58b40f4245d66fdb should be reverted.\r\n\r\nThe usage suggested in javadoc `AbstractSoftAssertions.fail` is unsafe:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@return nothing, it's just to be used in {@code doSomething(optional.orElseGet(() -> fail(\"boom\")));}.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`SoftAssertion` does not really fail when `fail(...)` is executed, so `orElseGet` would return `null`, and `doSomething` method would fail with NPE.\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nKotlin code:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nAssertions.fail(\"this value is not supported yet ...\") // <-- error here\r\n\r\nSoftAssertions.assertSoftly { softly ->\r\n    softly.fail(\"test\") // <-- error here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2895/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1367473644","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2094#issuecomment-1367473644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2094","id":1367473644,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5Rgf3s","user":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-29T17:15:21Z","updated_at":"2022-12-29T17:15:21Z","body":"@vlsi it's mentioned in its [Javadoc](URL):\r\n\r\n> **Returns:**\r\n>   nothing, it's just to be used in `doSomething(optional.orElseGet(() -> fail(\"boom\")));`.\r\n\r\nI see JUnit 5 [elaborates it better](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.8.2/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#fail(java.lang.String)):\r\n\r\n> The generic return type `V` allows this method to be used directly as a single-statement lambda expression, thereby avoiding the need to implement a code block with an explicit return value. Since this method throws an [`AssertionFailedError`](https://ota4j-team.github.io/opentest4j/docs/1.2.0/api/org/opentest4j/AssertionFailedError.html) before its return statement, this method never actually returns a value to its caller. The following example demonstrates how this may be used in practice.\r\n>\r\n> ```java\r\n>  Stream.of().map(entry -> fail(\"should not be called\"));\r\n>
