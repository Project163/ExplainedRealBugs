the bug**\r\nI needed to combine assertion with a custom comparator and recursive comparison of an unordered collection. At first, it worked like a charm, but in a very specific case, it started to fail. I spent hours debugging it and I think I know what causes that problem. In `RecursiveComparisonDifferenceCalculator#initDualValuesToCompare()` detected dual values are filtered to remove already visited cases. However, the `equals()` method of `DualValue` only checks `actual` and `expected` values, ignoring `fieldLocation` (there is a comment there questioning this btw ;) ). As a result, similar dual values created in different locations (e.g. the same object in different collections) are marked as similar and removed. Then, the collection of differences is empty and then `compareUnorderedIterables()` wrongly assumes it found a match and removes investigated value from its iterator...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.24.2\r\n* java version: 17.0.3\r\n* test framework version: JUnit 5.8.2\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nIt sounds a bit complicated so I highly recommend seeing the example code below and running it with a debugger. Ofc it's not my real case, just a minimal example to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nIt will throw `AssertionError` with the message: `The following expected elements were not matched in the actual List12:\r\n  [pl.edu.agh.mobint.db.application.statistics.phonenumber.Example$DataStore@7331196b]`. If you remove the custom comparator, the test passes. \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Example {\r\n\r\n  class DataStore {\r\n    List<Data> store1 = new ArrayList<>();\r\n\r\n    List<Data> store2 = new ArrayList<>();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  class Data {\r\n    private String text;\r\n\r\n    Data(String text) {\r\n      this.text = text;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getText() {\r\n      return text;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String toString() {\r\n      return \"Data: \" + text;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  void assertTest() {\r\n    var dataStore1 = createDataStore(true);\r\n    var dataStore2 = createDataStore(false);\r\n\r\n    assertThat(List.of(dataStore1)).usingRecursiveComparison(RecursiveComparisonConfiguration.builder()\r\n            .withComparatorForType(Comparator.comparing(Data::getText), Data.class)\r\n            .build())\r\n        .ignoringCollectionOrder()\r\n        .isEqualTo(List.of(dataStore2));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private DataStore createDataStore(boolean reverse) {\r\n    var data1 = new Data(\"123\");\r\n    var data2 = new Data(\"456\");\r\n    var data3 = new Data(\"987\");\r\n\r\n    var dataStore = new DataStore();\r\n    dataStore.store1.addAll(reverse ?
