bad, I confused usingComparator with usingElementComparator. \n\nThe approach you recommend above is a good work around but it would be nice to have the assertion return a useful error message if `opt.get` is empty instead of throwing a `NoSuchElementException`. I could always do a `ifPresent` check as as a separate assert first but it would be nice to assert ''ifPresent``` and validate the value in a single statement.\n\nI'll take a look at the code and see what needs to be done.
