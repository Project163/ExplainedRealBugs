Please, check it out. \nTo make the tests pass, I hade to refactor the test written for the case  that `MultipleAssertionsError` is thrown. The tests for the case that `AssertJMultipleFailuresError` is thrown still passes as they use not equality, but \"contains\" checks, so I left them as they are. If you see a need for update, I can refactor those tests as well.
