Summary\r\nCurrently when comparing two representations of the same entity from different domains/models, where one has null for a collection and the other has an empty collection, there is no option to treat these fields as being equal. \r\n\r\nI can see there are options for `.ignoringActualNullFields()` and `.ignoringExpectedNullFields()`, but these options have other ramifications, when all I want to do is treat null and empty collections as matching.\r\n\r\nI propose that a new option be introduced, something like \r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(dto)\r\n    .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n    .treatingNullAndEmptyCollectionsAsEquals() # name just a placeholder, feel free to use a different one\r\n
