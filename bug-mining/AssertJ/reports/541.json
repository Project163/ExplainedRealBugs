It would be nice to be able to reference these directly via a `BiPredicate<T, T>` and have it work with `isEqualTo` and other relevant methods.\n\n#### Example\n\n```java\nassertThat(actual)\n    .usingEqualityMethod((x, y) -> x.equalsStrict(y))\n    .isEqualTo(expected);\n\n// or\n\nassertThat(actual)\n    .usingEqualityMethod(MyObject::equalsStrict)\n    .isEqualTo(expected);\n```\n\nI can currently hack around this by (ab)using `usingComparator`, but it's not ideal.\n\n```java\nassertThat(actual)\n    .usingComparator((x, y) -> x.equalsStrict(y) ? 0 : -1)\n    .isEqualTo(expected)\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
