Summary\r\nI'm trying to do some test with firebase SDK things, the problem that the assertThat always failing with message:\r\n\r\n> [error] Expecting\r\n> [error]   <CompletableFuture[Incomplete]>\r\n> [error] to be completed.\r\n> [error] Be aware that the state of the future in this message might not reflect the one at the time when the assertion was per\r\n> formed as it is evaluated later on, took 0.145 sec\r\n> \r\n\r\nand I'm not sure how to make it wait, I can do just a stupid solution with `.join()` to make it work, but really it is not something that I'm looking for with this case.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nI have the following method of my service:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param email\r\n     * @return token\r\n     */\r\n    public CompletableFuture<String> getCustomToken(String email) {\r\n        CompletableFuture<String> future = new CompletableFuture<>();\r\n        ApiFuture<UserRecord> emailAsync = firebaseAuthProvider.get().getUserByEmailAsync(email);\r\n\r\n        emailAsync.addListener(() -> {\r\n            try {\r\n                UserRecord userRecord = emailAsync.get();\r\n                if (userRecord != null && userRecord.getUid() != null) {\r\n                    ApiFuture<String> customTokenAsync = firebaseAuthProvider.get().createCustomTokenAsync(userRecord.getUid());\r\n                    customTokenAsync.addListener(() -> {\r\n                        try {\r\n                            future.complete(customTokenAsync.get());\r\n                        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {\r\n                            future.completeExceptionally(e);\r\n                        }\r\n                    }, ec.current());\r\n                } else {\r\n                    future.completeExceptionally(new BusinessException(MsgKeys.ERR_USER_UID_NOT_FOUND));\r\n                }\r\n            } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException exception) {\r\n                logger.error(exception.getMessage());\r\n                future.completeExceptionally(new BusinessException(MsgKeys.ERR_VALIDATE_TOKEN_FAILED, exception.getCause()));\r\n            }\r\n        }, ec.current());\r\n        return future;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen This is the test method: \r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testLoginWithCustomTokenMustFailWithVerifyIdToken() {\r\n        logger.info(\"Testing login, we will create a custom token then verify it, it should be success until reach verifyIdToken and fail, because we can only verifyIdToken with \" +\r\n                \"tokens from frontend\");\r\n        String email = config.getString(\"firebase.test.email\");\r\n        CompletionStage<String> tokenFuture = firebaseAuthService.getCustomToken(email);\r\n        logger.info(\"Testing creating custom token for email \" + email);\r\n\r\n        assertThat(tokenFuture).isCompletedWithValueMatching(token -> {\r\n            JsonNode jsonNode = Json.newObject().put(\"token\", token);\r\n            logger.info(\"Trying to verify token \" + token);\r\n\r\n            exception.expectCause(allOf(Matchers.instanceOf(FirebaseAuthException.class), hasProperty(\"message\", startsWith(\"verifyIdToken() expects an ID token, but was given a custom token\"))));\r\n            Http.RequestBuilder request = Helpers.fakeRequest()\r\n                    .method(POST)\r\n                    .bodyJson(jsonNode)\r\n                    .uri(\"/api/user/firebaseLogin\");\r\n\r\n            Result route = route(app, request);\r\n            return route.status() == 200;\r\n        }, \"Creating custom token for \" + email);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I replace `CompletionStage<String> tokenFuture = firebaseAuthService.getCustomToken(email);` with ` CompletionStage<String> tokenFuture = CompletableFuture.completedFuture(firebaseAuthService.getCustomToken(email).join());` it will work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it my code issue, or test not waiting correctly, or am I missing something?\r\n\r\n#### Evironment: \r\n\r\nJava 8 & 10: \r\n\r\n> java version \"1.8.0_162\"\r\n> Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_162-b12)\r\n> Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build
