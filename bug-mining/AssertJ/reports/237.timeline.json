commit builds under both JDK8 and JDK9 in Travis CI.\r\nMinus a couple of caveats, it fixes the JDK9 build with various changes:\r\n\r\nVersion Bumps\r\n - Update to Gradle 4.2.1 for full compatibility with JDK9\r\n - Bump asciidoctor plugin^[1]\r\n - Bump Mockito^[2] and Jacoco to their latest JDK9-compatible versions\r\n - Bump AssertJ to 3.8.0^[3]\r\n - Bump Kotlin Gradle Plugin to 1.5.51^[4]\r\n\r\n[1] Asciidoctor Caveat:\r\n***********************\r\nIn JDK9, don't build the PDF as no compatible combination of\r\nasciidoctorJ-pdf could be found...\r\n\r\n[2] Tests Adaptation, Mockito Caveats:\r\n**************************************\r\nFix scan tests that use mocks of non-Scannable PARENTs/ACTUALs\r\n\r\nAdded MockUtils with interfaces that help creating Scannable mocks that\r\nalso implement another interface for combinations not naturally found in\r\nproduction code.\r\n\r\nSee Mockito issue https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/357, which\r\nis probably the cause why these used to pass on JDK 8.\r\n\r\n[3] AssertJ Caveat:\r\n*******************\r\nAdded workaround to an AssertJ issue in Java 8, see:\r\nhttps://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/1046\r\n\r\n[4] Kotlin Caveats:\r\n*******************\r\n - Fixed building of Javadoc under JDK9 polluted by Kotlin classes that\r\n are deemed invalid by the Java 9 doclet. (these used to be ignored in\r\n Java 8)\r\n - Dokka is not building, so we exclude kdocZip (and thus dokka) under\r\n JDK9 (see https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka/issues/220)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-core/issues/893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-core/issues/893/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1281822131,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyODE4MjIxMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1281822131","actor":{"login":"simonbasle","id":6986166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODYxNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6986166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle","html_url":"https://github.com/simonbasle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbasle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d95e1962b1a57a6bac2c52c489a44b4c4a3ea38d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-core/commits/d95e1962b1a57a6bac2c52c489a44b4c4a3ea38d","created_at":"2017-10-06T13:56:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14496753764,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAIX3Vs4Oqm1ZzwAAAANgEuhk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14496753764","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-02T23:56:51Z","label":{"name":"type: bug","color":"D4C5F9"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
