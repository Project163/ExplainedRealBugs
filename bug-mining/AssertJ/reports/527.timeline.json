Only the one right before the first AssertJ method is supposed to be removed.\r\n\r\nIf you would run the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\nvoid testStacktrace() {\r\n\tAssertions.setRemoveAssertJRelatedElementsFromStackTrace(false);\r\n\tassertThat(0).isEqualTo(1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou would see how the stack trace really looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nkept -->\tat java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DirectConstructorHandleAccessor.newInstance(DirectConstructorHandleAccessor.java:62)\r\nkept -->\tat java.base/java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstanceWithCaller(Constructor.java:502)\r\nremoved -->\tat java.base/java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:486)\r\nremoved -->\tat org.assertj.core.error.ConstructorInvoker.newInstance(ConstructorInvoker.java:28)\r\nremoved -->\tat org.assertj.core.error.ShouldBeEqual.assertionFailedError(ShouldBeEqual.java:223)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe any element that is a consequence of `org.assertj.core.error.ConstructorInvoker.newInstance` is not valuable for the users and should be pruned.\r\n\r\nReferring to the original example, what users should see is only:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \r\nexpected: 1\r\n but was: 0\r\n\tat net.amygdalum.WorldTest.testStacktrace(WorldTest.java:13)\r\n\tat ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n@joel-costigliola how do you see it?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow it currently looks without and with the removal of AssertJ elements:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \r\nexpected: 1\r\n but was: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/assets/26772046/2cb01604-1794-4ba8-95ee-22797a76cbc9)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/2083302343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12646765437,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs6HNaI2zwAAAALxzlN9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/12646765437","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-29T17:43:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12646765443,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs6HNaI2zwAAAALxzlOD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/12646765443","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-29T17:43:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12646765456,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs6HNaI2zwAAAALxzlOQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/12646765456","actor":{"login":"almondtools","id":2934333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2934333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools","html_url":"https://github.com/almondtools","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/received_events","type":"User","u

it is just the fact that I read your statement to literal,\r\n\r\nIn your stacktrace you find two (!) lines concerning the test :\r\n\r\n```\r\nat

In your proposal you picked both (fine by me). \r\n\r\nYou described this as:\r\n\r\n> I think we should remove all stack trace elements starting from the first assertj element.\r\n\r\nBut you kept the user-code line for `isEqualTo` which literally is a stacktrace element after the first assertj element. I just wanted to clarify it.\r\n\r\nConcerning suffix artifacts and infix artifacts - maybe this is a wrong translation of my thoughts. I mean the following:\r\n\r\nIn the general case we can have following types of stackelements to be removed\r\n\r\n- statements between two user-code statements (e.g. between satisfies and isEqualTo) -> infix lines\r\n- statements after the last user-code statement -> suffix lines\r\n\r\nIn your last stacktrace there are no suffix lines - but in mine there were. I vote for removing both, but keeping the user-code statements. In the concrete case we would find a stracktrace like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nat org.example.test.Remove_assertJ_stacktrace_elements_Test.lambda$should_$3(Remove_assertJ_stacktrace_elements_Test.java:67)\r\nat org.example.test.Remove_assertJ_stacktrace_elements_Test.should_(Remove_assertJ_stacktrace_elements_Test.java:66)\r\n...

framework)\r\n```","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/2118909060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"almondtools","id":2934333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2934333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools","html_url":"https://github.com/almondtools","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almondtools/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/2119010055","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3449#issuecomment-2119010055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3449","id":2119010055,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5-TYcH","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-18T21:40:49Z","updated_at":"2024-05-18T21:46:17Z","body":"I'll
