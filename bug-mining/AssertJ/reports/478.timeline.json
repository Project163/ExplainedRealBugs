good suggestions. Thank you, @scordio.\r\n\r\n`isNumeric()` implies _this is a string representation of a number — ANY number_\r\n`containsOnlyDigits()` says _this string contains ONLY digits_\r\n\r\nThe names `containsOnlyDigits()` and `isDigit()` are consistent with the POSIX character class `\\p{Digit} — A decimal digit: [0-9]`. The character class is _not_ named `\\p{Numeric}`. Naming consistency is useful to both API maintainers and consumers.\r\n\r\nAssertions should be named to adhere to the _Principle of Least Surprise_ — they should behave as most API consumers would expect them to. E.g., the presence of a distinct `isHexadecimal()` assertion informs me that `\\p{Digit}` will not match all valid numeric string representations, hexadecimal strings among them.\r\n\r\nI would expect an `isNumeric()` assertion to succeed with the `float` string `\"12.03456789\"`\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString floatStr = \"12.03456789\";\r\nassertThat(floatStr).isNumeric();\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that the example `float` (and many other valid numeric String representations) do not match `\\p{Digit}`, it would be clearer to indicate that the assertion succeeds _only_ if the string contains solely digits, i.e., `isDigit()`.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1028023069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chagmed","id":21175275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTc1Mjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21175275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed","html_url":"https://github.com/chagmed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chagmed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5996385781,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs5CSA-szwAAAAFlaZX1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5996385781","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-02T14:56:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5996385791,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs5CSA-szwAAAAFlaZX_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5996385791","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-02T14:56:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1028191165","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2472#issuecomment-1028191165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2472","id":1028191165,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs49SPO9","user":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-02T17:44:00Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T17:44:00Z","body":"Honestly
