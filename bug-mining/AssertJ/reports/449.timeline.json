.isEqualTo(expected);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that at the moment, using  `withEqualsForType(closeEnough, Number.class)` instead of `withEqualsForFields(closeEnough, \"value\")` does not work as AssertJ selects its default `Double` comparator over `closeEnough`, whether it is the desired behavior is debatable, on one hand the `Double` comparator is an exact match for the Double value to compare but OTOH user own comparator / BiPredicate should have precedence.

Actually I would just expect the assertion to fail, as those two objects are not equal. So I would expect a failing test and not a test in error. \r\n\r\nGiven the case you have a more complex object, e.g., \r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\n  void test() {\r\n    MyObject a = new
