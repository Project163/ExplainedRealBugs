It seems to be because of the `IterableDiff` class it uses, which checks the extra and missing elements with an algorithm suitable for checking the elements in any order. However, this is not necessary, since they have to be present in the exact order and so a more efficient linear solution could look something like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nboolean compare(expected, actual) {\r\n    if (expected.size() != actual.size()) return false;\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < expected.size(); i++) {\r\n       if (expected.get(i) != actual.get(i)) return false;\r\n    }\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe ran a scalability analysis on various assertions, which you can find [here](https://desosa2022.netlify.app/projects/assertj/posts/scalability/) if you are interested.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2548/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
