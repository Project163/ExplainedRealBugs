Summary\r\n\r\nRxJava exposes [its own internal collections for test, which extend AtomicInteger](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/2.x/src/main/java/io/reactivex/internal/util/VolatileSizeArrayList.java).\r\n\r\nHowever, when asserting on that list, AssertJ will detect that list is of type AtomicInteger and print integer value instead of list contents on errors.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nAdd to gradle:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompile \"io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.2.8\"\r\ncompile \"org.assertj:assertj-core:3.11.1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute:\r\n```java\r\nFlowable<String> textObservable = Flowable.just(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\");\r\n\r\nList<String> receivedEntries = textObservable.test().values();\r\n\r\n// Prints [A, B, C] normally\r\nSystem.out.println(receivedEntries);\r\n\r\n// Prints AtomicInteger(3) when assert fails\r\nassertThat(receivedEntries).isEmpty();\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
