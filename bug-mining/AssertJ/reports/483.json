It comes from statistiesForProxy implementation\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  protected SELF satisfiesForProxy(Consumer<? super ACTUAL>[] assertionsGroups) throws AssertionError {\r\n    checkArgument(stream(assertionsGroups).allMatch(java.util.Objects::nonNull), \"No assertions group should be null\");\r\n    if (stream(assertionsGroups).allMatch(this::satisfiesAssertions)) return myself;\r\n    // some assertions groups were not met! let's report all the errors\r\n    List<AssertionError> assertionErrors = stream(assertionsGroups).map(this::catchOptionalAssertionError)\r\n                                                                   .filter(Optional::isPresent)\r\n                                                                   .map(Optional::get)\r\n                                                                   .collect(toList());\r\n    throw multipleAssertionsError(assertionErrors);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuting the consumer twice is usually OK as most consumers are idempotent. However, some are not. I stumbled upon this is issue writing the following test involving a JAX-RS response\r\n\r\n```java\r\n              .run( webTarget -> {\r\n                        var response = webTarget.get( );\r\n\r\n                        assertThat( response )\r\n                                .satisfies( isClientErrorWithMessage( \"filter\", \"foo\" ) );\r\n                    } );\r\n\r\n\r\n Consumer<Response> isClientErrorWithMessage( String field, String... messageParts ) {\r\n        return response -> {\r\n            assertThat( response.getStatus( ) ).isEqualTo( 400 );\r\n\r\n            var jsonResponse = response.readEntity( JsonNode.class );\r\n            [...]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nA response can only be read once. `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Entity input stream has already been closed .` is displayed rather than the actual error. \r\n \r\nIt seems easy to change satisfiesForProxy implementation to avoid the superfluous execution. I can try to submit a merge request if you acknowledge the issue and that my reasoning is correct. \r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.22.0\r\n* java version: 17\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    void reproducer( ) {\r\n        Consumer<String> consumer = s -> {\r\n            System.out.println( s );\r\n            assertThat( s ).isEqualTo( \"bar\" );\r\n        };\r\n        assertThat( \"Foo\" ).satisfies( consumer );\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nFoo\r\nFoo\r\n\r\n\r\nexpected: \"bar\"\r\n but was: \"Foo\"\r\nComparison Failure: \r\nExpected :\"bar\"\r\nActual   :\"Foo\"\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
