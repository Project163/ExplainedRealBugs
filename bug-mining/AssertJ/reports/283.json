If it included it would help to fix failed tests faster.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<String> strings = Arrays.asList(\"hello\", \"bye\", \"goodbye\");\r\n\r\nassertThat(strings).size().isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(4);\r\n```\r\n**Actual error message:**\r\n_Expecting:\r\n <3>\r\nto be greater than or equal to:\r\n <4>_ \r\n\r\n**Expected error message:**\r\n_Iterable does not match size requirements:\r\n[\"hello\", \"bye\", \"goodbye\"]\r\nExpecting:\r\n <3>\r\nto be greater than or equal to:\r\n <4>_\r\n\r\nI took a look at the code but it doesn't seem to be trivial to fix since `IterableSizeAssert` extends `AbstractIntegerAssert`. With the current implementation the only way I can imagine is overriding every assertion method in `IterableSizeAssert` and decorate with it a try-catch but that would be bad for a lot of reasons. Could you maybe advise on how I (or anyone) could proceed with this?","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1253/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
