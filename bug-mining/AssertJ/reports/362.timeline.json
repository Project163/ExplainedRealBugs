It would be easier to follow the tests progressing to the point of failure.\r\nBut to be honest I perfectly see a case where as part of a bdd approach I don't only say \"THEN I verify the box is happy\" but I also output what the actual checks were. Would be useful for both live documentation, supervision of tests, learning when new to the domain, deep reporting, etc.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/583213389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SebastianStavar","id":26761786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzYxNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26761786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar","html_url":"https://github.com/SebastianStavar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianStavar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3292018084,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDMyOTIwMTgwODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/3292018084","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-01T02:18:29Z","milestone":{"title":"3.17.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/626279926","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1777#issuecomment-626279926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1777","id":626279926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjI3OTkyNg==","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-10T06:16:31Z","updated_at":"2020-05-10T06:36:08Z","body":"I'll go for displaying the assertion description to the console (if a description was set). \r\n@SebastianStavar I was thinking to a global configuration property to control whether descriptions are displayed or not, is that too broad? do you need control per assertion?\r\n\r\nAnother question, I was thinking to allow registering a consumer to consume descriptions, if such a consumer is registered it would be executed instead of printing the description to the console.\r\nThoughts?
