XML should be compared being aware of namespaces, where the ns url is relevant but the ns prefix name isn't.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following XML can be considered the same:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ns:foo\r\n    xmlns:arc=\"http://a\"\r\n    xmlns:ns=\"http://b\" xmlns:reg=\"c\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n`<foo xmlns=\"b\"/>`\r\n\r\nThis XML represents exactly the same data and will be processed the same way by XML parsers in any language that follow the XML spec. Just formatting them the same way isn't going to do it.\r\n\r\nA better way to compare is how XMLUnit [handles comparisons](https://github.com/xmlunit/user-guide/wiki/DifferenceEvaluator#default-differenceevaluator). It's pretty flexible and ignores prefix naming by default:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMatcherAssert.assertThat(inputXML, CompareMatcher.isSimilarTo(controlXML));\r\nMatcherAssert.assertThat(inputXML, CompareMatcher.isIdenticalTo(controlXML));\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nCompareMatcher.isSimilarTo(control)\r\n    .ignoreComments()\r\n    .ignoreWhitespace()\r\n    .normalizeWhitespace()\r\n    .throwComparisonFailure()\r\n    .ignoreElementContentWhitespace();\r\n```\r\nPerhaps it's possible to borrow some defaults from there (most importantly formatting and namespace awareness)?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/388283484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bbottema","id":2115718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTU3MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2115718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema","html_url":"https://github.com/bbottema","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbottema/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1621352909,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTYyMTM1MjkwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1621352909","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-11T07:28:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1621352911,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2MjEzNTI5MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1621352911","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-11T07:28:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/388319547","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/96#issuecomment-388319547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/96","id":388319547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODMxOTU0Nw==","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costi
