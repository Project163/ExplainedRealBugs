So I had the idea to add a method like this to my `SoftAssertions` subclass:\r\n\r\n````java\r\npublic void softly(Runnable run) {\r\n    try {\r\n        run.run();\r\n    } catch (AssertionError e) {\r\n       proxies.collectError(e);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nProblem is, although `proxies` is protected and visible to my subclass, its type `SoftProxies` is package-private and is not. Thus it won't compile.\r\n\r\nI'd have offered a fix, but this is probably more of an architectural issue that needs some more thought from a core developer, depending on whether you really want the functionality of `proxies` exposed to subclasses . Possibilities are:\r\n\r\n1. Make `proxies` package-private or private, so that it is not intended for subclasses to use.\r\n2. Make `SoftProxies` public and part of the API.\r\n3. Change it to use a different type or a publicly-available interface (eg, `ISoftProxies`) which the package-private `SoftProxies` class then implements.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1323/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
