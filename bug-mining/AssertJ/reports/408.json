For example one can compose the A umlaut (Ä) with a single character: \\u00C4 Or with a combination of the A character and the dots (the dieresis character ¨): \\u0041\\u0308\r\n\r\nIn essence, you are using two unicode characters for one letter. Because equals() compares characters, the form with dieresis is not equals to the form without.\r\n\r\nThe problem is explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27670249/string-comparison-is-wrong/27670613#27670613\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(\"\\u00C4\").isEqualToNormalizingUnicode(\"\\u0041\\u0308\")\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2057/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
