Currently, `SoftAssertions` doesn't allow me to do so w/o extra synchronizers.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nFor example, this code is broken because changes made to the `SoftAssertions` instance from other threads might not be visible from the main thread:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        final SoftAssertions softly = new SoftAssertions();\r\n\r\n        final ForkJoinPool forkJoinPool = ForkJoinPool.commonPool();\r\n        forkJoinPool.execute(() -> {\r\n            softly.assertThat(\"foo\").hasToString(\"foo\");\r\n        });\r\n        forkJoinPool.execute(() -> {\r\n            softly.assertThat(\"bar\").hasToString(\"bar\");\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        softly.assertAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the best approach to solve the above problem?\r\n\r\nGuarding `SoftAssertions` with a synchronized block wherever I'm accessing the instance doesn't seem like a good solution (especially from test readability standpoint).\r\n\r\nProbably you could introduce something like `SynchronizedSoftAssertions` or least make the list of failures a _synchronized list_. At the same time, it's not clear how to guard the whole call chain like\r\n\r\n```java\r\nsoftly.assertThat(\"foo\").hasToString(\"foo\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith a single lock.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1879/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
