Status Quo\n\nIn JUnit, we have an assertion similar to the following.\n\n```java\nassertThatExceptionOfType(JUnitException.class)\n\t\t.isThrownBy(() -> predicates.looksLikeIntendedTestClass(TestCase.class))\n\t\t.withMessage(\"...\");\n```\n\nWhen that fails to throw a `JUnitException`, we get the following failure message in the `AssertionError`.\n\n```\nExpecting code to raise a throwable.\n```\n\n#### Expected Behavior\n\nFor the previous example, I would expect to get the following failure message in the `AssertionError` (or similar).\n\n```\nExpected code to throw org.junit.platform.commons.JUnitException, but no exception was thrown.\n```\n\nAt the very least, I would expect that the \"expected type of exception\" (`org.junit.platform.commons.JUnitException` in this case) is included in the failure message.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3845/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3845/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
