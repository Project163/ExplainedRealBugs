testing map entries looks like :\n\n``` java\nMap<String, String> address = ....\nassertThat(address).hasSize(15)\n                .includes(\n                        MapAssert.entry(\"zip\",

\"Culloden\")\n                );\n```\n\nWe can simplify this by getting rid of the repeated MapAssert.entry calls:\n\n``` java\n Map<String, String> address = ....\n assertThat(address).hasSize(15)\n                    .containsEntry(\"zip\", \"43865\")\n                    .containsEntry(\"lastName\", \"Frazier\")\n                    .containsEntry(\"state\", \"IA\")\n                    .containsEntry(\"city\", \"Culloden\");\n```\n\nsee https://github.com/alexruiz/fest-assert-2.x/pull/117\n\nAdded : do the same thing for the opposite assertion `doesNotContainEntry`\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
