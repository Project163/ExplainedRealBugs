\r\n\r\n> happy to do that after we review the issue and how to address it.\r\n\r\nFYI: \r\n\r\nI've already been looking at the containsKey() case. I traced it back to the implementation of java.util.Map.containsKey() on the unmodifiable map that you get in case of f.e. the of() method. This is one that does not allow null keys, so it assumes internally that the key you are checking for is not null and throws an NPE if it is. Which, fair enough, is allowed under the spec of containsKey().\r\n\r\nMy first idea here is to wrap the existing call to containsKey() in a try/catch block, catch the NPE, check that the key being searched for is indeed null (so we know more or less for sure we are in the case described in the spec) and then just add null to the notfound set being filled in the existing code.\r\n\r\nSee org.assertj.core.internal.Maps, line 386.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/948078448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BenTels","id":5958372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTgzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5958372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels","html_url":"https://github.com/BenTels","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5494817615,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs49dA3jzwAAAAFHhENP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5494817615","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-20T22:15:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5494817619,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs49dA3jzwAAAAFHhENT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5494817619","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-20T22:15:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/948331246","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2379#issuecomment-948331246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2379","id":948331246,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs44hmLu","user":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"pu

project.\r\n\r\nBen.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/948388798/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BenTels","id":5958372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTgzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5958372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels","html_url":"https://github.com/BenTels","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5496879435,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs49dA3jzwAAAAFHo7lL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5496879435","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-21T08:40:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5496879441,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs49dA3jzwAAAAFHo7lR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5496879441","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-21T08:40:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/948586783","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2379#issuecomment-948586783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2379","id":948586783,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs44ikkf","user":{"login":"BenTels","id":5958372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTgzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5958372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels","html_url":"https://github.com/BenTels","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T12:54:44Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T12:54:44Z","body":"Anybody

`\"COLOR\"` with `equals` instead of the actual map key comparison strategy (case insensitive string in the example).\r\n\r\nIt's not yet clear if there is a way to address this issue, if not we would have to mention the limitation in the
