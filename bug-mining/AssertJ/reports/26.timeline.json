your solution works but it still relies on generics which is root of the problem.\nSorry, the issue was not clear, let's take another example with an Employee class inheriting from Person to show where is the problem :\n\n``` java\nEmployee bill = new Employee(\"Bill\", 50, \"micro$oft\");\nassertThat(bill).isEqualTo(bill); // OK\n// now let's view billou as a Person and not an Employee anymore\nPerson billou = bill;\n// next line leads to a compile error although bill and billou are exactly the same.\nassertThat(bill).isEqualTo(billou); \n```\n\nThe idea here is simply to use an Object instead of generic parameter A in `AbstractAssert`.\nI know we loose type checking here but I'm not sure if it was really useful (please tell me if you disagree).\n\nThis issue is just a step toward less generics and will be followed by others to remove generics in assertions methods parameter like `contains` (but one step at a time)\n\nNote that `AbstractAssert` generic parameter must be kept for assertions based on `Condition`.\n\nThanks for the effort though

the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.25.3\r\n* java version: 21.0.1-open\r\n* test framework version: JUnit 5.10.2\r\n* os (if relevant):  Linux 6.5.0-15-generic # 15-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Jan  9 17:03:36 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 23.10)\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nSome timestamp types, for example, `java.sql.Timestamp`, are not specifically handled when comparing with other temporal types, and as a result, though there are no compile-time errors caused by types, they are not effectively compared as temporals.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Demo {\r\n    @Test\r\n    void compareSqlTimestampWithInstant() {\r\n        final long now = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n        final Timestamp ts = new Timestamp(now);\r\n        final Instant instant = Instant.ofEpochMilli(now);\r\n        assertEquals(ts.getNanos(), instant.getNano()); // this succeeds\r\n        assertThat(ts).isEqualTo(instant); // this fails.\r\n        assertThat(ts).isAfterOrEqualTo(instant); // even if I want to relax the check, this still fails\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see there are javadocs mentioning that comparisons are done by converting these timestamp types to `java.util.Date`, but is there a way to make this less surprising, otherwise make it a compilation error, so the user can take care of nanoseconds?\r\n\r\n**Updated**: I thought it was caused by nano-second precision being dropped along the assertion classes, but it turns out that there is no special handling of such types, and they end up calling `Object.equals()`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
