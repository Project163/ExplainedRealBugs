first sight, the issue is in `StandardComparisonStrategy#iterableContains`: \r\n```\r\n  public boolean iterableContains(Iterable<?> iterable, Object value) {\r\n    if (iterable == null) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    for (Object next : iterable) {\r\n      if (areEqual(next, value)) {\r\n        return true;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIt checks values one by one with `areEqual` instead of using the iterable `contains` method, this was made to be able to override `areEqual` to use a different comparison strategy.\r\n\r\nTo follow the principle of least surprise, I think this should be changed so that collection accepting a Comparator are correctly honored (mainly `TreeSet`).\r\n\r\nThat should also fix #1104 I

Summary\r\nSince assertj 3.10.0, we get a `java.lang.ClassCastException` when using `assertThat().extracting()` on a `SortedSet`. \r\nThis issue seems to be related to the update done in #1202.\r\nThe `Comparator` used is the one from the `SortedSet` to compare the extracted value.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage io.test;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.*;\r\nimport org.testng.annotations.Test;\r\n\r\nimport static java.util.Comparator.*;\r\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\r\n\r\npublic class AssertJSortedSetIssue {\r\n    private static class InternalClass {\r\n        private final String m_member;\r\n\r\n        private InternalClass(String member) {\r\n            m_member = member;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private String getMember() {\r\n            return m_member;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void shouldNotFail() {\r\n        SortedSet<InternalClass> sortedSet = new
