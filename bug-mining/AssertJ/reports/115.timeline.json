problem comes from [DateFormat parse](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/DateFormat.html#parse%28java.lang.String%29) that may not use the entire text of the given string. \nThe default date formats supported are:\n1. `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS`\n2. `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`\n3. `yyyy-MM-dd`\n\nThe first two don't match `2015-04-12 21:25:12.293` but the third does as the start of `2015-04-12 21:25:12.293` matches `yyyy-MM-dd`.\n\nTo support `Timestamp` string representation (which unfortunately does not comply with [ISO 8601 format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations)), we should simply add  `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS` in default supported date
