have a bunch of code where I test timings and averages which can vary. Our tests allow variance since the underlying behavior is non-deterministic to exact values. Instead we apply a range of valid values, but this range loses the semantics of the value we are actually trying to assert. I'd like to propose an value approximation assertion which carries the correct readability semantics for what we are actually trying to test.\n\nMore concretely, we currently have code like this:\n\n``` java\nfoo.withWindow(1000/*ms*/).doSomething(10/*times*/);\nassertThat(foo.getAverageWindow()).isBetween(990, 1010);\n```\n\nWhat I want it something like this:\n\n``` java\nfoo.withWindow(1000/*ms*/).doSomething(10/*times*/);\nassertThat(foo.getAverageWindow()).isApproximately(1000, /*±*/10);\n```\n\nThoughts?\n\nThe implementation would just delegate to `isBetween` with `value+variance` and `value-variance` but the semantics of the API are much nicer.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
