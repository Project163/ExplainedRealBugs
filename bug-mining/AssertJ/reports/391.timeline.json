Summary\r\nAbstractCompletableFutureAssert has methods to run assertions on CompletableFutures.\r\nHowever, in any given unit test, the given CompletableFuture might not have completed yet, causing the test to be brittle. The exception report can be quite confusing because between the test  failure and the printing of the test error, the future might complete. So even a test asserting isDone() can fail with a message showing a done future.\r\n\r\nCoding around this is ugly. Would be real nice if assertj had some waiting (with timeout, with default timeout) function embedded.\r\n\r\nAlso would be nice if this would work with CompletionStages as well.\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```\r\nCompletionStage<Foo> fooStage = getFoo();\r\nassertThat(fooStage).completesWithin(1000).hasFailedWithThrowableThat()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: I think the awaitility library could also help, but so far did not use it. Could be this is better solved by using both awaitility and assertj.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1010/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"tkruse","id":1525116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse","html_url":"https://github.com/tkruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T08:02:46Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T08:02:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1149","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1149/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1149/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1149/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1149","id":286937613,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODY5Mzc2MTM=","number":1149,"title":"CompletionStage

Summary\r\nI'm trying to do some test with firebase SDK things, the problem that the assertThat always failing with message:\r\n\r\n> [error] Expecting\r\n> [error]   <CompletableFuture[Incomplete]>\r\n> [error] to be completed.\r\n> [error] Be aware that the state of the future in this message might not reflect the one at the time when the assertion was per\r\n> formed as it is evaluated later on, took 0.145 sec\r\n> \r\n\r\nand I'm not sure how to make it wait, I can do just a stupid solution with `.join()` to make it work, but really it is not something that I'm looking for with this case.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nI have the following method of my service:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param email\r\n     * @return token\r\n     */\r\n    public CompletableFuture<String> getCustomToken(String email) {\r\n        CompletableFuture<String> future = new CompletableFuture<>();\r\n        ApiFuture<UserRecord> emailAsync = firebaseAuthProvider.get().getUserByEmailAsync(email);\r\n\r\n        emailAsync.addListener(() -> {\r\n            try {\r\n                UserRecord userRecord = emailAsync.get();\r\n                if (userRecord != null && userRecord.getUid() != null) {\r\n                    ApiFuture<String> customTokenAsync = firebaseAuthProvider.get().createCustomTokenAsync(userRecord.getUid());\r\n                    customTokenAsync.addListener(() -> {\r\n                        try {\r\n                            future.complete(customTokenAsync.get());\r\n                        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {\r\n                            future.completeExceptionally(e);\r\n                        }\r\n                    }, ec.current());\r\n                } else {\r\n                    future.completeExceptionally(new BusinessException(MsgKeys.ERR_USER_UID_NOT_FOUND));\r\n                }\r\n            } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException exception) {\r\n                logger.error(exception.getMessage());\r\n                future.completeExceptionally(new BusinessException(MsgKeys.ERR_VALIDATE_TOKEN_FAILED, exception.getCause()));\r\n            }\r\n        }, ec.current());\r\n        return future;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen This is the test method: \r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testLoginWithCustomTokenMustFailWithVerifyIdToken() {\r\n        logger.info(\"Testing login, we will create a custom token then verify it, it should be success until reach verifyIdToken and fail, because we can only verifyIdToken with \" +\r\n                \"tokens from frontend\");\r\n        String email = config.getString(\"firebase.test.email\");\r\n        CompletionStage<String> tokenFuture = firebaseAuthService.getCustomToken(email);\r\n        logger.info(\"Testing creating custom token for email \" + email);\r\n\r\n        assertThat(tokenFuture).isCompletedWithValueMatching(token -> {\r\n            JsonNode jsonNode = Json.newObject().put(\"token\", token);\r\n            logger.info(\"Trying to verify token \" + token);\r\n\r\n            exception.expectCause(allOf(Matchers.instanceOf(FirebaseAuthException.class), hasProperty(\"message\", startsWith(\"verifyIdToken() expects an ID token, but was given a custom token\"))));\r\n            Http.RequestBuilder request = Helpers.fakeRequest()\r\n                    .method(POST)\r\n                    .bodyJson(jsonNode)\r\n                    .uri(\"/api/user/firebaseLogin\");\r\n\r\n            Result route = route(app, request);\r\n            return route.status() == 200;\r\n        }, \"Creating custom token for \" + email);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I replace `CompletionStage<String> tokenFuture = firebaseAuthService.getCustomToken(email);` with ` CompletionStage<String> tokenFuture = CompletableFuture.completedFuture(firebaseAuthService.getCustomToken(email).join());` it will work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it my code issue, or test not waiting correctly, or am I missing something?\r\n\r\n#### Evironment: \r\n\r\nJava 8 & 10: \r\n\r\n> java version \"1.8.0_162\"\r\n> Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_162-b12)\r\n> Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build

part of the discussion but it seems to me that the cancelation should be a failure as well. The documentation states the following: \r\n\r\n> Since (unlike FutureTask) this class has no direct control over the computation that causes it to be completed, cancellation is treated as just another form of exceptional completion. Method cancel has the same effect as completeExceptionally(new CancellationException()). Method isCompletedExceptionally() can be used to determine if a CompletableFuture completed in any exceptional fashion.\r\n\r\nBut again, maybe this was discussed and there's a good reason I cannot not see?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/679239868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hadrienk","id":207345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/207345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk","html_url":"https://github.com/hadrienk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadrienk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/680273062","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1150#issuecomment-680273062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1150","id":680273062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDI3MzA2Mg==","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-25T21:13:34Z","updated_at":"2020-08-25T21:13:34Z","body":"I agree that would be the most natural.\r\n\r\nI remember spending quite a bit of time trying to get the `CompletableFuture` assertions right and not being fully happy with them but at the time that was the best I could think of, in hindsight I would probably do it differently today, I'll consider deprecating `hasFailed` as part of this piece of work.
