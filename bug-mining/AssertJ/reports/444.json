Summary\r\n\r\nSimilar to  https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/issues/2401 but for iterable/arrays\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few variations to cover and tests;\r\n- [x] `extracting(Function)`, `map(Function) `, `extracting(ThrowingExtractor)` and `map(ThrowingExtractor)`, will be fixed by changing `internalExtracting`, tests needed for the 4 methods exposed in the API.\r\n- [x]
