Summary\r\n\r\nThis test should pass but fails.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Test\r\n  void should_pass_if_case_insensitive_actual_contains_given_entries_in_rder() {\r\n    // GIVEN\r\n    actual = new CaseInsensitiveMap<>();\r\n    actual.put( \"Color\", \"green\" );\r\n    actual.put( \"NAME\", \"Yoda\" );\r\n\r\n    // THEN\r\n    maps.assertContainsExactly(someInfo(), actual, entry(\"COLOR\", \"green\"), entry(\"Name\", \"Yoda\"));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue is when `containsExactly` verifies that the entries are in the same order, it ends up comparing `\"Color\"` against `\"COLOR\"` with `equals` instead of the actual map key comparison strategy (case insensitive string in the example).\r\n\r\nIt's not yet clear if there is a way to address this issue, if not we would have to mention the limitation in the javadoc.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
