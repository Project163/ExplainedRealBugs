Summary\n\nIt would be nice to have support for java 8 predicates.\nAssertions should allow for testing them instead of testing everyone separetly.\n#### Real life use case / example\n\nGood:\n\n```\n//given\nacceptedValues = Lists.newArrayList(\"a\",\"b\")\n\n//when\nfinal Predicate<String> predicate = Predicate.create(acceptedValues);\n\n//then\nassertThat(predicate).accepts(\"a\")\n                     .accepts(\"b\")\n                     .doesNotAccept(\"c\")\n                     .accepts(Lists.newArrayList(\"a\",\"b\"))\n                     .doesNotAccept(Lists.newArrayList(\"c\",\"d\"));\n```\n\nNot good:\n\n```\n//given\nacceptedValues = Lists.newArrayList(\"a\",\"b\")\n\n//when\nfinal Predicate<String> predicate = Predicate.create(acceptedValues);\nboolean result1 = predicate.test(\"a\");\nboolean result2 =
