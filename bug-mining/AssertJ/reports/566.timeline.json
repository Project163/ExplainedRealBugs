I've investigated the code and it looks like Assertj makes a comparison between key sets and if they differ in size, it doesn't go further with the comparison because maps with different size are different already without the need of deep diving into entry differences. That's why you are missing the insights of differences between key sets.\n\nIs your expectation to have a more insightful message providing the difference in key sets when they have different size? And do you want me to check for `symmetric` or `asymmetric` difference between the two key sets?\n\n> Asymmetric difference – Finding those elements that are contained by set1 but not contained by set2\n> Symmetric difference – Finding the elements in either of the sets but not in their
