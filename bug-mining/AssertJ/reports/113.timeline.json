Summary\r\n\r\nSimilar to fluent assertions on the `size()` of an `Iterable` (#301), it would be handy to have the same for the `toString()` of an `Object`.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(object).hasToString().contains(\"text\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently there's only `hasToString(String)`, which asserts an exact match.\r\n\r\nOf note, this example perhaps doesn't read as nice as say, `assertThat(object).asString().contains(...)`.  As currently defined, [asString()](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/core-8/api/org/assertj/core/api/AbstractAssert.html#asString--) fails if `object` is not an instance of `String`, making that approach a breaking change.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround I'm following the recommendation in https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/357#issuecomment-89548008, and doing:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(object.toString()).contains(\"text\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n...however, this results in a `NullPointerException` instead of a nice `AssertionError` in the event `object` is null.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
