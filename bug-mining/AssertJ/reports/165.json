Some of these parameters are BigDecimal values, but the parameter can be null.  Using an `ArgumentCaptor`, I can easily get the list of values that were passed.  If I want to verify the content, I'd like to use a `BigDecimalComparator`, but it doesn't tolerate `null` values.  For example, this fails with a `NullPointerException`:\n\n``` java\nList<BigDecimal> values = new ArrayList<>();\nvalues.add(BigDecimal.valueOf(1.0));\nvalues.add(null);\nvalues.add(null);\nvalues.add(BigDecimal.valueOf(1.23));\n\nassertThat(values)\n    .usingElementComparator(new BigDecimalComparator())\n    .containsExactly(BigDecimal.ONE, null, null, BigDecimal.valueOf(1.230));\n```\n\nWhile it's easy to wrap it into a `NullComparator` like this `Comparator.nullsFirst(new BigDecimalComparator))`, I think that a simple enhancement to the `BigDecimalComparator` would allow this case to be supported.  If you agree, I can submit a PR.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
