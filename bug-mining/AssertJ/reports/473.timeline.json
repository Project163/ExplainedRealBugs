The issue is that `assertj-core` 3.23.0 depends upon Jupiter 5.9.0-M1 [inadvertently](https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/issues/2637) and we had Jupiter 5.8 in the test execution. It all resolves because `assertj-core` optionally depends upon the Jupiter packages since people may use `assertj-core` without Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me this sort of problem will occur in the future as `assertj-core` raises the level of Jupiter required.\r\n\r\nSo I am wondering if we should include some runtime check of the bundle wirings to detect and alert the case where the Jupiter and `assertj-core` bundles are resolved but the `assertj-core` bundle's optional wirings to Jupiter are not wired.\r\n\r\nIn `biz.aQute.tester.junit-platform` where it [confirms the test call can be resolved](https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/blob/1e03d93bf600dbe87604a80018f28be98519245e/biz.aQute.tester.junit-platform/src/aQute/tester/bundle/engine/discovery/BundleSelectorResolver.java#L389-L395) when the test class resolve fails (as it does in the above case), the code could examine the bundles for optional wires to Jupiter which are not wired and provide a more informative message.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bndtools/bnd/issues/5271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bndtools/bnd/issues/5271/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6711476726,"node_id":"CE_lADOAIX3Vs5KvrKIzwAAAAGQCQH2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/6711476726","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"6529933700533de4e8f8191d9b6f4ef371667f1d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/commits/6529933700533de4e8f8191d9b6f4ef371667f1d","created_at":"2022-05-31T17:10:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1142423119","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2637#issuecomment-1142423119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2637","id":1142423119,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5EF_5P","user":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-31T17:37:20Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T17:37:20Z","body":"@bjhargrave
