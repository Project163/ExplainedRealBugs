Summary\n\nHi,\nI have proposal of some improvement regarding field assertions on single object.\nNow when some type is not known we can do following assert:\n#### Example\n\n``` java\nassertThat(throwable).isInstanceOf(MyException.class);\nassertThat(((MyException) throwable).getErrorCode())\n        .isEqualTo(someCode);\n```\n\nwhat do you think to add feature which would avoid to cast explicitly ?, for example:\n\n``` java\nassertThat(throwable).isInstanceOf(MyException.class).extracting(\"errorCode\").isEqualTo(someCode);\n```\n\nIt could work in similar way as 'extract' for collections.\n\nThanks,\nTomek\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/730/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/730/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T21:04:31Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T21:04:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/662","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/662/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/662/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/662/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/662","id":153970524,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTM5NzA1MjQ=","number":662,"title":"Allow

Summary\n\nWhen asserting on APIs that return a base class you know the type of, it can be useful to be able to cast the object under assertion fluently for more type-safety. This should probably be an asType, similar to asString and asList, though it would be conceivable for isInstanceOf to do this conversion too.\n#### Real life use case / example\n\n``` java\nclass Animal {\n  String getName();\n}\n\nclass Cat extends Animal {\n  String getMeow();\n}\n\nassertThat(zooService.getCurrentPet()).asType(Cat.class).extracting(Cat::getMeow).contains(\"purr\");\n```\n#### Java 8 specific ?\n\nYES (not so useful without lambdas for type-safety)\n\nIf the issue Java 8 specific, the Pull Request must be based on the `master`, otherwise the `2.x` branch must be used.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/662/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/247759534","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/683#issuecomment-247759534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/683","id":247759534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Nzc1OTUzNA==","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-17T09:29:01Z","updated_at":"2016-09-17T09:29:01Z","body":"As
