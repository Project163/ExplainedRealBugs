Summary\r\nI like the recursive comparison strategy for `isEqualTo`. In addition I propose an new comparison strategy that works on public `getXXX()` methods. This makes it easy to compare beans with each other and at the same time also checking the getter implementations. This is especially useful when getters return `Optional`s, because I often found issue where `Optional.of()` was used when instead `Optional.ofNullable()` should have been used. Instead of writing a test for every single getter this could then be done with a single call.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Bean {\r\n   private String s = null;\r\n   \r\n   public Optional<String> getS() { return Optional.of(s); } // coding error here\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n// This finds the error\r\nassertThat(new Bean()).usingRecursiveBeanComparison().isEqualTo(new Bean());\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2108/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/827811255","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2189#issuecomment-827811255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2189","id":827811255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNzgxMTI1NQ==","user":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-27T18:14:20Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T18:14:20Z","body":"@nach-o-man

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen comparing values, AssertJ takes a very strong opinion that the objects are defined by their _fields_, which is contrary to general Java best practice and makes testing interface-based code difficult. It seems that AssertJ will internally use property-based access as some kind of fallback, but it has eager fast-fail on some very ordinary use cases.\r\n\r\nInstead, AssertJ should _prefer_ property-based access when it's declared, and it should not perform invasive introspection if a perfectly suitable public property is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface MailMessage {\r\n  String getTemplate();\r\n  InternetAddress getRecipient();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass HelloMessage implements MailMessage {\r\n  @Override public final String getTemplate() { return \"hello\"; }\r\n  @Getter @Setter InternetAddress recipient;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\nclass GenericMessage implements MailMessage {\r\n  String template;\r\n  InternetAddress recipient;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my code, I want to assert that, after processing, `var original = new HelloMessage()` and `var result // instanceof GenericMessage` have the same property values. However, trying to use `assertThat(result).usingRecursiveComparison().isEqualTo(original)` produces this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGenericMessage can't be compared to HelloMessage as  does not declare all GenericMessage fields, it lacks these: [template]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`template` is most certainly declared as a _property_, which is all that most infrastructure cares about, and the old `isEqualToComparingFieldByField`, even though named \"field\", handled this fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2314/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5718997741,"node_id":"DEME_lADOAIX3Vs4zxFE_zwAAAAFU4Prt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5718997741","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-06T08:50:50Z","milestone":{"title":"3.22.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5718997746,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAIX3Vs4zxFE_zwAAAAFU4Pry","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5718997746","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-06T08:50:50Z","milestone":{"title":"3.23.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6188608630,"node_id":"DEME_lADOAIX3Vs4zxFE_zwAAAAFw3qx2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/6188608630","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-05T02:33:16Z","milestone":{"title":"3.23.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6188608631,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAIX3Vs4zxFE_zwAAAAFw3qx3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/6188608631","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}

Summary\r\nIf you have a getter that modifies the value or only returns a subset of the value, the [current resolving strategy](https://assertj.github.io/doc/#how-field-values-are-resolved) is error prone / unusable for recursive comparison tests (see example below).\r\nPerhaps it's possible to add the support to do the value resolution only by field via reflection? Perhabs a boolean configuration could override the [current implementation](https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/blob/a49869bf382f19a3dd4ada49e655c07f90fab05a/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/util/introspection/PropertyOrFieldSupport.java#L70)?\r\nCurrently, we use the recursive comparison for all our tests and love the fact that new properties of a class are always tested immediately. Thanks for the new kind of testing 👍🏼 \r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nNote: This is only an example to illustrate the problem. The easy solution would be the usage of \"clean\" getters. But if you have a public API you couldn't just change the internal behaviour…\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Example\r\n{\r\n    private Collection<String> value;\r\n\r\n    public Example(Collection<String> value)\r\n    {\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getValue()\r\n    {\r\n        if (value == null)\r\n        {\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n        return value.iterator().next();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ExampleTest\r\n{\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testRecCom() // should fail\r\n    {\r\n        Assertions.assertThat(new Example(List.of(\"A\", \"B\")))\r\n                .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                .ignoringAllOverriddenEquals()\r\n                .withStrictTypeChecking()\r\n                .isEqualTo(new Example(List.of(\"A\")));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGreetings!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2149/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11610441132,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs4zxFE_zwAAAAK0CUWs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/11610441132","actor":{"login":"schlosna","id":54594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna","html_url":"https://github.com/schlosna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ba6b5dfbd320e0149b6e6d6bf6452195288c73c8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schlosna/assertj-core/commits/ba6b5dfbd320e0149b6e6d6bf6452195288c73c8","created_at":"2024-01-26T15:56:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
