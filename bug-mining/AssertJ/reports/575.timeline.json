Cool! \n\nA few questions:\n\n- Should I use the 'since' parameter in the `@Deprecated` annotation? And if so, which version should I use? \n- What to do which the Javadoc of the deprecated public methods? The new method will have the correct Javadoc ('Newlines'). The old one can just have no Javadoc other than a `@deprecated Please use... instead.`, right? \n- Should there still be unit tests for the deprecated public methods?

Check List:\r\n* Fixes #2754\r\n* Unit tests : NO (see below)\r\n* Javadoc with a code example (on API only) : NO (Updated existing JavaDoc on lowercase methods, no duplicate JavaDoc on deprecated uppercase methods)\r\n* PR meets the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), I think. This is my first PR for this project. If not, let me know 🙂 \r\n\r\n### Changes: \r\n* `Strings`:\r\n  - **Renamed** `assertContainsIgnoringNewLines` (uppercase) to `assertContainsIgnoringNewlines` (lowercase). I thought that since this classes is in the `internal` package, I could safely rename the method, instead of keeping the uppercase one around for backward compatibility.\r\n* `AbstractCharSequenceAssert`: \r\n  - **Added** `containsIgnoringNewlines` (lowercase)\r\n  - **Deprecated** `containsIgnoringNewLines` (uppercase), keeping this one around for backward compatibility\r\n  - **Added** `isEqualIgnoringNewlines` (lowercase)\r\n  - **Deprecated** `isEqualIgnoringNewLines` (uppercase), keeping this one around for backward compatibility\r\n* Unit tests: Updated for the exisiting public methods, didn't add any new unit tests for the deprecated methods. If required, I can add them. \r\n\r\n### Please note\r\n* SonarLint throws up warnings about blocking issues: the uppercase and lowercase method names are confusing. \r\n* I have not copied the JavaDoc from the lowercase methods to the uppercase methods. \r\n\r\n### Not changed: \r\n* Errors concerning the aforementioned assertions: \r\n  - Class `ShouldBeEqualIgnoringNewLines` and its factory method `shouldBeEqualIgnoringNewLines`;\r\n  - Class `ShouldBeEqualIgnoringNewLineDifferences` and its factory method `shouldBeEqualIgnoringNewLineDifferences`.\r\n\r\nThese can be changed, but I'm not sure how to name them. Change only the factory methods? Add a lowercase factory method? Duplicate the entire class (to lowercase) and deprecate the uppercase one?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2777/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20162018757,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAIX3Vs5Qs3m0zwAAAASxv_3F","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/20162018757","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-08T11:48:18Z","milestone":{"title":"4.0.0-M2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20167821431,"node_id":"CE_lADOAIX3Vs5Qs3m0zwAAAASyGIh3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/20167821431","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"686b9f718c18cdd8bdf9fc263558450477a9bf3a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/commits/686b9f718c18cdd8bdf9fc263558450477a9bf3a","created_at":"2025-10-08T16:19:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20169893690,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs5Qs3m0zwAAAASyOCc6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/20169893690","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"686b9f718c18cdd8bdf9fc263558450477a9bf3a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Mu-L/assertj-core/commits/686b9f718c18cdd8bdf9fc263558450477a9bf3a","created_at":"2025-10-08T18:25:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
