Summary\r\nAssertJ already has support for soft assertions. However, that feature might be difficult to discover as it's not part of the main API and also a bit error-prone considering that you have to remember to call `assertAll` in the end.\r\n\r\n`AbstractAssert` already contains a `satisfiesAnyOf` method, so this proposed method would be a nice complement to that. It would be easy to discover and would be less error-prone.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nTolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter(\"Frodo\", HOBBIT);\r\n    \r\nConsumer<TolkienCharacter> isHobbit = tolkienCharacter -> assertThat(tolkienCharacter.getRace()).isEqualTo(HOBBIT);\r\nConsumer<TolkienCharacter> isElf = tolkienCharacter -> assertThat(tolkienCharacter.getRace()).isEqualTo(ELF);\r\nConsumer<TolkienCharacter> isFrodo = tolkienCharacter -> assertThat(tolkienCharacter.getName()).isEqualTo(\"Frodo\");\r\nConsumer<TolkienCharacter> isBoromir = tolkienCharacter -> assertThat(tolkienCharacter.getRace()).isEqualTo(\"Boromir\");\r\n    \r\n// assertion succeeds:\r\nassertThat(frodo).satisfiesAllOf(isHobbit, isFrodo);\r\n    \r\n// assertion fails reporting all failures:\r\nassertThat(boromir).satisfiesAllOf(isElf, isBoromir);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the proposal is accepted I would be happy to contribute.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
