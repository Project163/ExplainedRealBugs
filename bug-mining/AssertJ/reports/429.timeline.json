Changes\r\n- Migrate usage of `TableMetadata.addSchema` method\r\n- Fix `ENDPOINTS` in `IcebergCatalogAdapter`\r\n- Implement `initCatalog` method in `CatalogTests` \r\n- Config `PreferredAssumptionException` to JUnit5 in `PolarisRestCatalogIntegrationTest` and `BasePolarisCatalogTest`   due to:\r\n   - `Assumptions.assertThat` of AssertJ, used in `CatalogTests` in Iceberg, is incompatible with Quarkus, see quarkusio/quarkus#46642.  \r\n   -  **Next step:** Polaris handles empty namespaces differently than expected in [`listNamespacesWithEmptyNamespace`](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/58b283e3533afce8b9884ac847a46eb40688353b/core/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/catalog/CatalogTests.java#L992-L1000). Consider whether to align this behavior.\r\n- Fix [`createViewWithCustomMetadataLocation`](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/58b283e3533afce8b9884ac847a46eb40688353b/core/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/view/ViewCatalogTests.java#L243-L272) in `QuarkusRestCatalogViewFileIT` and `QuarkusRestCatalogViewFileIntegrationTest` by ensuring that the `tempDir` remains within `BASE_LOCATION`.  \r\n   - **Next step:** Decide whether to directly add the value of `write.metadata.path` to `AllowedLocations` in `BasePolarisCatalogViewBuilder` when specified by the user, similar to #193.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Possible security vulnerabilities: STOP here and contact security@apache.org instead!\r\n\r\n    Please update the title of the PR with a meaningful message - do not leave it \"empty\" or \"generated\"\r\n    Please update this summary field:\r\n\r\n    The summary should cover these topics, if applicable:\r\n    * the motivation for the change\r\n    * a description of the status quo, for example the current behavior\r\n    * the desired behavior\r\n    * etc\r\n\r\n    PR checklist:\r\n    - Do a self-review of your code before opening a pull request\r\n    - Make sure that there's good test coverage for the changes included in this PR\r\n    - Run tests locally before pushing a PR (./gradlew check)\r\n    - Code should have comments where applicable.
