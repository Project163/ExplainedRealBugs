agree that this behavior is bad, the reason it fails is that BigDecimal with the same numerical value but different scale are not equal, e.g : 1.0 is not equal to 1.00. \n\nIn the meantime you can use a custom ComparisonStrategy based on BigDecimal `compareTo` method, I think that should work.\n\nJoel\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/40058702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":110438614,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDExMDQzODYxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/110438614","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-04-10T09:29:40Z","milestone":{"title":"1.7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/40186047","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/190#issuecomment-40186047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/190","id":40186047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTg2MDQ3","user":{"login":"yurloc","id":673386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MzM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/673386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc","html_url":"https://github.com/yurloc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurloc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-11T09:28:38Z","updated_at":"2014-04-11T09:28:38Z","body":"I
