Summary\r\n\r\nI faced an unexpected behavior (for me) with `usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator` and `usingComparatorForType `.\r\n\r\nI'd except them to go recursively through all fields and check each field value. But something seems to be checking for the hash/equals before doing so.\r\n\r\nIn the example bellow the test that `works()` uses `@lombok.Getter` which does not override hash/equals, the test that `fails()` uses `@lombok.Value` which does override.\r\n\r\nIf that's not a bug, It would be good to have something to add clarity to this issue.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage
