Feature summary\r\n\r\nThis has been inspired by https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/pull/2658\r\n\r\n@scordio , what do you think of testing **various** Java vendors for better test coverage?\r\nI believe it would help both assertj (e.g. avoid accidental dependency on OpenJDK+HotSpot implementation), Java vendors (you'll test their implementations and hopefully report bugs), and the Java community (everybody wins from better AssertJ and better Java).\r\n\r\nHere's a script that automatically generates random subset of the parameters for CI testing: https://github.com/vlsi/github-actions-random-matrix\r\n\r\nHere's how it looks like in pgjdbc project: https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/runs/6876908328?check_suite_focus=true\r\nIt enables to capture bugs like:\r\n* Bugs in timezone-related code (matrix can shuffle timezones)\r\n* Bugs in locale-dependent code. For instance, tr_TR locale surfaces a LOT of bugs (https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/17361, https://github.com/spockframework/spock/issues/1414, https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/2890)\r\n* Bugs in OS-dependent code (matrix can shuffle operating systems)\r\n* Accidental dependency on `Obejct#hashCode` uniqueness\r\n* Accidental dependency on HotSpot JIT implementation (matrix can add \"randomize JIT decisions\" options to surface issues like \"wrong usage of volatile\")\r\n* Combinations of the above!\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the CI duration is easy to configure: you can specify the number of jobs you need, so you don't end up with \"PR test takes hours\".\r\nAt the same time, you can hard-code \"known interesting\" cases. For instance, you can ask matrix to always include \"lowest supported Java\", \"always include a test with `Object#hashCode` returning the same value for all objects\", etc.\r\nAt the same time, if you happen to run into an obscure failure (e.g. CI failure in Pacific/Chatham timezone on Windows), then you can test it with a couple of lines. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in pgjdbc we have a flaky test that is related to replication. I've submitted a small PR that basically requests the matrix to produce \"only replication-related test\": https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2545\r\nNote that we test against 13 PostgreSQL versions, and some of the do not support replication. The matrix handles all that just fine. The user says \"I want replication only\", and the matrix obeys and produces a variety of matching cases.\r\n\r\nIn case you wonder, the total number of valid permutations for pgjdbc is ~1'000'000.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/runs/6876908328?check_suite_focus=true\r\nSee
