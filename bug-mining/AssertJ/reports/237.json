Summary\r\nI was on AssertJ 3.6.1 and just bumped the dependency to 3.8.0. That caused compiler errors on a few assertions around a `Stream<? extends Scannable>`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: cannot find symbol\r\n\t\tassertThat(s.inners()).hasSize(1);\r\n\t\t                      ^\r\n  symbol:   method hasSize(int)\r\n  location: class AbstractObjectAssert<CAP#1,Stream<CAP#2>>\r\n  where CAP#1,CAP#2 are fresh type-variables:\r\n    CAP#1 extends AbstractObjectAssert<CAP#1,Stream<CAP#2>> from capture of ?\r\n    CAP#2 extends Scannable from capture of ? extends Scannable\r\n```\r\nIt reports the same kind of error with `isEmpty()`. Completion in the IDE (IntelliJ) works fine though.\r\nI tested rebuilding with AssertJ 3.7.0 with the same result, but it works fine with 3.6.2.\r\nAny idea about the root cause?\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n```java\r\ndefault Stream<? extends Scannable> inners() {\r\n\treturn Stream.empty();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(s.inners()).hasSize(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Java 8 specific ?\r\nYES : create Pull Request from the `master` branch\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
