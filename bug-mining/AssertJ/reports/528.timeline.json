uses various date format to get parse the date from the given string, in the test case, it is the `yyyy-MM-dd` date pattern (as expected).\r\n\r\nAssertJ delegates the parsing to `SimpleDateFormat` [parse](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html#parse(java.lang.String,java.text.ParsePosition)) method, there is not much AssertJ can do at this point, it's in the hand of the java runtime.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the parsing has to use the default timezone because `2024-03-01` is not a `Date` but a `LocalDate`, to make it a `Date` it has to be interpreted within a timezone which can be no other than the default timezone.\r\n\r\nPassing string instead of date was added to avoid building dates by hand which was pain before java 8, it's now less useful with the new date/time API which provides a bunch of factory methods.\r\n\r\n@wimdeblauwe what behavior would you have liked to see
