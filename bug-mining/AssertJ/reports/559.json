Feature summary\n\nIt would be nice to have `AbstractCharSequenceAssert#doesNotContainSequence` and `AbstractCharSequenceAssert#doesNotContainSubsequence` methods similar to the `doesNotContainSequence` and `doesNotContainSubsequence` methods from the `AbstractIterableAssert` class.\n\n### Example\n\n#### `AbstractCharSequenceAssert#doesNotContainSequence`\n\n```java\nString book = \"{ 'title':'A Game of Thrones', 'author':'George Martin' }\";\n\n// assertions will pass\nassertThat(book).doesNotContainSequence(\"A Game of \", \"Shadows\");\nassertThat(book).doesNotContainSequence(\"A Game of \", \"George Martin\");\n\n// assertions will fail\nassertThat(book).doesNotContainSequence(\"A Game of \", \"Thrones\");\n```\n\n#### `AbstractCharSequenceAssert#doesNotContainSubsequence`\n\n```java\nString book = \"{ 'title':'A Game of Thrones', 'author':'George Martin' }\";\n\n// assertions will pass\nassertThat(book).doesNotContainSubsequence(\"A Game of \", \"Shadows\");\n\n// assertions will fail\nassertThat(book).doesNotContainSubsequence(\"A Game of \", \"George Martin\");\nassertThat(book).doesNotContainSubsequence(\"A Game of \", \"Thrones\");\n```","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
