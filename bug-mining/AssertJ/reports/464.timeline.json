Summary\r\n`satisfies()` with nested assertions obscures stack trace\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nWe have a `satisfies()` call with many embedded assertions like this. AssertJ doesn't expose the stack trace of the actual line that triggered the assertion in this case, only the `satisfies()` line:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat( tsdbDeviceMediator.getDeviceSnapshots( 1 ) )\r\n        .singleElement()\r\n        .satisfies( tsdbDevice -> {\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getRevision() ).isEqualTo( 1 );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getPlatform() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getProfile() ).isEqualTo( \"ios\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getProfileOverrides() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getModel() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getFirmwareVersion() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getSerialNumber() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.isDynamicIpAddress() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getIpAddress() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getMacAddress() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getSecondaryMacAddress() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getAlias() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getTvModelId() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getDisplayMode() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getSkinResolution() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.getMaxAgeRating() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n            assertThat( tsdbDevice.isTombstone() ).isFalse();\r\n        } );\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's what it looks like when I run this in IntelliJ. Line 222 is highlighted in the stack trace, but not the actual exception-triggering line:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/630613/160089235-895f0e74-2041-430b-9567-b207a2b0f046.png)\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, if I wrap this in a `try`/`catch` like below and rethrow it as a `RuntimeException`, it starts working much better:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat( tsdbDeviceMediator.getDeviceSnapshots( 1 ) )\r\n        .singleElement()\r\n        .satisfies( tsdbDevice -> {\r\n            try {\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getRevision() ).isEqualTo( 1 );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getPlatform() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getProfile() ).isEqualTo( \"ios\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getProfileOverrides() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getModel() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getFirmwareVersion() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getSerialNumber() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.isDynamicIpAddress() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getIpAddress() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getMacAddress() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getSecondaryMacAddress() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getAlias() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getTvModelId() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getDisplayMode() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getSkinResolution() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.getMaxAgeRating() ).isEqualTo( \"IOS\" );\r\n                assertThat( tsdbDevice.isTombstone() ).isFalse();\r\n            }\r\n            catch ( Throwable t ) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException( t );\r\n            }\r\n        } );\r\n```\r\n\r\nLine 227 is properly listed in the stack trace, making it much easier to debug the actual cause of the problem:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/630613/160089417-6facea93-fba8-44b0-80ac-752d09da613a.png)\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nCould this be a bug in IntellIJ or AssertJ?
