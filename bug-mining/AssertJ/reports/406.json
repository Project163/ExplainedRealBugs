For each element of the tested collection the (remaining) consumers are called; if a consumer accepts the element, then the element and that consumer are removed from their collections and the next element is probed.\r\n\r\nThe additional method would have the signature: \r\n```java\r\npublic final SELF satisfyExactlyInAnyOrder(Consumer<? super ELEMENT>... consumers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the method would be overloaded with an assert factory as first parameter and consumers operating not on the collection ELEMENT but on an assertion over that element (as suggested by @jbytecoder):\r\n```java\r\npublic final <A extends AbstractAssert<?, ELEMENT>> \r\nSELF satisfyExactlyInAnyOrder(Function<ELEMENT, A> assertFactory, Consumer<? super A>... consumers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: the implementation from #1892 (originally for the `satisfy` method, aka. `containsElementsSatisfyingExactlyInAnyOrder`, still pending agreement on clear naming) already performs all necessary logic. It could be combined with a simple length verification.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(trilogy).satisfyExactlyInAnyOrder(movie -> {\r\n    // the fellowship of the Ring\r\n    assertThat(movie.getReleaseDate()).isBefore(parse(\"2002-12-17\"));\r\n    assertThat(movie.xrated).isFalse();\r\n  }, \r\n  movie -> {\r\n    // the Return of the King\r\n    assertThat(movie.getTitle()).endsWith(\"King\");\r\n  },\r\n  movie -> {\r\n    // the two Towers\r\n     assertThat(movie.getReleaseDate()).isEqualTo(parse(\"2002-12-18\"));\r\n     assertThat(movie.getTitle()).contains(\"Towers\");\r\n  } \r\n);\r\n\r\nassertThat(movieTitles).satisfyExactlyInAnyOrder(\r\n  Assertions::assertThat,\r\n  s -> s.matches(\".* Return .* King\"),\r\n  s -> s.endsWith(\"Towers\"), \r\n  s -> s.contains(\"fellowship\")\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue (and #2053) was split from #1621 as suggested by @joel-costigliola in https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/issues/1621#issuecomment-539696963","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2054/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
