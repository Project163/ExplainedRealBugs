These assertion could simply check file.length(), which returns the length of a file in bytes. At present I'm having to do something like `assertThat(file.length()).isGreaterThan(0)`\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(file)\r\n.isEmpty()\r\n.isNotEmpty()\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1638/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1638/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
