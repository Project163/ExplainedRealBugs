Summary\r\nI find myself writing tests for Bean mappers, mapping e.g CustomerOrderDTO to CustomerOrder and similar. Regularly this involves comparing collections. While this can be done with Comparators, comparators have several disadvantages, they only return a number, and they do not make use of fluent APIs (unless someone knows a fluentAPI to create Comparators?).\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<AdressDTO> source = generateAdressDTOs();\r\nList<Adress> target = convert(source);\r\nassertThat(source).comparedToOtherSatisfies(target, (AdressDTO dto, Adress adress) -> {\r\n   assertThat(dto.getZipcode() + ' ' + dto.getCity()).isEqualTo(adress.getCityLine())\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaps would probably also be useful. Not sure what else.\r\n\r\nI assume the above can also be achieved using a Comparator<Object> that casts, and returns 0 or throws AssertionException. But that's somewhat ugly...\r\n\r\n#### Java 8 specific ?\r\n\r\nNot sure if that makes much sense without lambdas...","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1022/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
