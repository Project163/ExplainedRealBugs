But these two assertions have different behaviours. It should be a serious bug, and hope the team can look at it. \r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(0.125f).isEqualTo(0.5f, within(0.375f)); // pass!\r\nassertThat(1.1f).isEqualTo(1.0f, within(0.1f)); // fail!\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the second assertion, the running result is:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting actual:\r\n  1.1f\r\nto be close to:\r\n  1.0f\r\nby less than 0.1f but difference was 0.100000024f.\r\n(a difference of exactly 0.1f being considered valid)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
