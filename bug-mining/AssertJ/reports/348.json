using AssertJ and in this specific case using `extracting(\"name1\", \"name2\").contains(val1, val2)` or the functional one `extracting(it -> it.getName1(), it -> it.getName()).contains(val1, val2)`. In case of a value not matching the error message is not as descriptive as one likes to be. \r\n\r\nCurrently it is :\r\n```\r\nExpecting:\r\n  <[null, 2019-12-05T07:57:38.531, null]>\r\nto contain exactly (and in same order):\r\n  <[null, 2019-12-05T07:57:38.531, null]>\r\nbut some elements were not found:\r\n  <[2019-12-05T07:57:38.531]>\r\nand others were not expected:\r\n  <[2019-12-05T07:57:38.531]>\r\n```\r\nAnd at first glance it isn't apparent what is wrong, as the values appear to match. However as it turned one one was a `LocalDateTime` and the other a `java.util.Date`. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing a single property with `isEqualTo` the error message is more descriptive\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting:\r\n <\"2019-12-05T07:59:56.439 (LocalDateTime@43f02ef2)\">\r\nto be equal to:\r\n <\"2019-12-05T07:59:56.439 (Date@239a307b)\">\r\nbut was not.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it is directly apparent what the error is as the type and hashcode is included in the error message. \r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial of the message from contains could also include the type and hashcode in the error message.
