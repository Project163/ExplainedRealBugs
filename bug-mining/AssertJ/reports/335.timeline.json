the behavior comes from the fact that doubles are compared according to https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Double.html#compareTo(java.lang.Double) which:\r\n\r\n> Compares two Double objects numerically. There are two ways in which comparisons performed by this method differ from those performed by the Java language numerical comparison operators (<, <=, ==, >=, >) when applied to primitive double values:\r\n> -   Double.NaN is considered by this method to be equal to itself and greater than all other double values (including Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY).\r\n> -   0.0d is considered by this method to be greater than -0.0d.  \r\n\r\nI think it is fair in that case to follow equals behavior and consider 0.0d to be equal to -0.0d,  to follow the behavior less surprising for most

represents -0.0, or vice versa, the equal test has the value false, even though +0.0==-0.0 has the value true. \r\n\r\nAssertJ usually follows the core java classes behavior so that would mean `isEqualTo`  would follow this behavior:\r\n* if given a `Double`: delegates to `Double.equals` and fails\r\n* if given a `double`: uses use `==` and pass\r\n\r\nFor consistency `isGreaterThanOrEqualTo` should follow the same behavior and evaluate `isEqualTo` before `isGreaterThan`.\r\n\r\n@carterkozak
