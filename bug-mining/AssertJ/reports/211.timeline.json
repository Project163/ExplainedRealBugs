Overview\n\nIn the Spring Framework, I recently introduced a test which needed to [assert both the cause and suppressed exceptions](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/6bbfd56dced92aa8465668ed3a28e740978a042d/spring-core/src/test/java/org/springframework/core/retry/RetryTemplateTests.java#L175-L183) in a given `Throwable`.\n\nThat currently looks something like this.\n\n```java\nassertThatExceptionOfType(RetryException.class)\n\t\t.isThrownBy(() -> retryTemplate.execute(retryable))\n\t\t.withMessage(\"Retry policy for operation 'test' exhausted; aborting execution\")\n\t\t.withCauseExactlyInstanceOf(IllegalStateException.class)\n\t\t.extracting(Throwable::getSuppressed, array(Throwable[].class))\n\t\t.satisfiesExactly(\n\t\t\tsuppressed1 -> assertThat(suppressed1).isExactlyInstanceOf(IOException.class),\n\t\t\tsuppressed2 -> assertThat(suppressed2).isExactlyInstanceOf(FileNotFoundException.class)\n\t\t);\n```\n\nHaving to combine `extracting(Throwable::getSuppressed, array(Throwable[].class))` with `satisfiesExactly()` seems like it should be unnecessary.\n\nPerhaps I have overlooked something, but I didn't find a simpler way to achieve my goal.\n\nIf there's an easier way to achieve, feel free to point me to that and close this issue.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIt would be nice to introduce something similar to the following in `ThrowableAssertAlternative` (and related classes).\n\n- `withSuppressedExceptionsSatisfying(ThrowingConsumer<? super Throwable>...)`\n- `withSuppressedExceptionsSatisfyingExactly(ThrowingConsumer<? super Throwable>...)`\n\nThat would allow me to simplify my assertion as follows.\n\n```java\nassertThatExceptionOfType(RetryException.class)\n\t\t.isThrownBy(() -> retryTemplate.execute(retryable))\n\t\t.withMessage(\"Retry policy for operation 'test' exhausted; aborting execution\")\n\t\t.withCauseExactlyInstanceOf(IllegalStateException.class)\n\t\t.withSuppressedExceptionsSatisfyingExactly(\n\t\t\tsuppressed1 -> assertThat(suppressed1).isExactlyInstanceOf(IOException.class),\n\t\t\tsuppressed2 -> assertThat(suppressed2).isExactlyInstanceOf(FileNotFoundException.class)\n\t\t);\n```\n\n## Related Issues\n\n-
