Feature summary\r\nEnhance the `byLessThan(..)` and `within` to support the usage of `Duration`. \r\n\r\nAt the moment `byLessThan(..)` and `within` support the usage of a value combined with a `TemporalUnit` which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(_07_10_20).isCloseTo(_07_11_45, byLessThan(1, ChronoUnit.MINUTES));\r\nassertThat(_07_10_00).isCloseTo(_07_12_00, within(1, ChronoUnit.MINUTES));\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nMy suggestion is to enhance it in that way that you are able to use `Duration` instead of two different parameters like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(_07_10_20).isCloseTo(_07_11_45, byLessThan(Duration.ofMinutes(1)));\r\nassertThat(_07_10_20).isCloseTo(_07_11_45, byLessThan(Duration.ofSeconds(45)));\r\n```\r\nor as example for `within`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(_07_10_00).isCloseTo(_07_12_00, within(Duration.ofMinutes(1)));\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3486/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3486/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
