as the following returns the same object:\n\n```\nSystem.out.println(Assertions.assertThat(map));\nSystem.out.println(Assertions.assertThat(map).as(\"\"));\n```\n\nI thought maybe that as() only worked with primitves, but BigDecimal works.\n\nPlease do not just \"close\" this issue.  Either find a fix or update the documentation for the assertThat() methods that do not work with as() so others don't have to do the research that at least 2 of us have now done.
