I could not find a way in which AssertJ has this functionality using SoftAssertions.\n\nFor example, below code will check all the assertions, and fail in the end if any of the assertion is failed.\n\n```java\nint age = 19;\nint birthYear = 2025;\nSoftAssertions.assertSoftly(sa -> {\n    sa.assertThat(age).as(\"Age\").isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(18);\n    sa.assertThat(birthYear).as(\"Birth Year\").isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(2005);\n});\n```\n\n\n#### Example\n\nWhat I want is exact opposite of above that if any of the assertion is passed, then the test should pass. Something. like below which checks all the assertions in end, and then passes the test if any of the assertion is passed. I understand this is possible via combining conditions, but this would make the tests a bit complicated, so a possibility to achieve in a similiar way would be helpful like adding a new `assertAny()`\nAn optional descriptive message could be outputted to warn the user if any assertion is failed, or more optimized way would be to just pass the test as soon as any of the assetion within this set has passed without continuing through rest.\n\n```java\nint age = 19;\nint birthYear = 2025;\nSoftAssertions.assertAny(sa -> {\n    sa.assertThat(age).as(\"Age\").isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(18);\n    sa.assertThat(birthYear).as(\"Birth Year\").isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(2005);\n});\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
