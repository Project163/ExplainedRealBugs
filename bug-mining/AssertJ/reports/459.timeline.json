the bug**\r\n\r\nThe following assertion passes for versions `≤ 3.22.0`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.awt.geom.Path2D;\r\n\r\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\r\n\r\npublic

   path1.curveTo(13, 2, 13, 5, 10, 7);\r\n    path1.lineTo(0, 7);\r\n    path1.curveTo(-3, 5, -3, 2, 0, 0);\r\n    path1.closePath();\r\n\r\n    var path2 = new Path2D.Float();\r\n    path2.moveTo(0,

assertThat(path1)\r\n        .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n        .isEqualTo(path2);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut from version `3.23.0+`, we get the following instead:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting actual:\r\n  java.awt.geom.Path2D$Float@6325a3ee\r\nto be equal to:\r\n  java.awt.geom.Path2D$Float@1d16f93d\r\nwhen recursively comparing field by field, but found the following difference:\r\n\r\nTop level actual and expected objects differ:\r\n- actual value  : java.awt.geom.Path2D$Float@6325a3ee\r\n- expected value: java.awt.geom.Path2D$Float@1d16f93d\r\n\r\nThe recursive comparison was performed with this configuration:\r\n- no overridden equals methods were used in the comparison (except for java types)\r\n- these types were compared with the following comparators:\r\n  - java.lang.Double -> DoubleComparator[precision=1.0E-15]\r\n  - java.lang.Float -> FloatComparator[precision=1.0E-6]\r\n  - java.nio.file.Path -> lexicographic comparator (Path natural order)\r\n- actual and expected objects and their fields were compared field by field recursively even if they were not of the same type, this allows for example to compare a Person to a PersonDto (call strictTypeChecking(true) to change that behavior).\r\n\r\n\tat Main.main(Main.java:26)\r\n``` \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nAfter debugging a bit, it seems that the problem is in the `RecursiveComparisonDifferenceCalculator.mustCompareFieldsRecursively()`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate boolean mustCompareFieldsRecursively(DualValue dualValue) {\r\n\r\n  return !recursiveComparisonConfiguration.hasCustomComparator(dualValue)   // <- evals to 'true'\r\n         && !shouldHonorEquals(dualValue, recursiveComparisonConfiguration) // <- evals to 'true'\r\n         && dualValue.hasNoContainerValues(); \r\n         //            ^\r\n         //            | \r\n         //  This evaluates to 'false'. I believe is because the class Path2D.Float\r\n         //  has its data in arrays and not in java collection type containers.\r\n\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.22.0+\r\n* java version: Java 11\r\n* test framework version: JUnit 4\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nAdd a test case showing the bug that we can run\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class SomeTest {\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void test() {\r\n    var path1 = new Path2D.Float();\r\n    path1.moveTo(0, 0);\r\n    path1.lineTo(10, 0);\r\n    path1.curveTo(13, 2, 13, 5, 10, 7);\r\n    path1.lineTo(0, 7);\r\n
