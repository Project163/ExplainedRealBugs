Summary\r\nWhen comparing different classes and specifying `comparingOnlyFields` the assertion could fail if the class `actual` has more fields than the class of `expected` even when those fields were not specified for comparison. The example below compares two objects twice, only reversing which one is `actual` and which one is `expected`. The first assertion passes and the second fails. I'd expect that both pass, or at least that both fail.\r\n\r\nRemoving `comparingOnlyFields` and setting the same value for `b` similarly results in failure only for the second assertion, but I'm not sure if this is intended or not.\r\n\r\nI've tested it with 3.21.0 and 3.22.0.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ComparingOnlyTest {\r\n  static class A1 {\r\n    public final int a, b, c;\r\n    public A1(int a, int b, int c) {\r\n      this.a = a;\r\n      this.b = b;\r\n      this.c = c;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  static class A2 {\r\n    public final int a, b;\r\n    public A2(int a, int b) {\r\n      this.a = a;\r\n      this.b = b;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testComparingOnly() {\r\n    var a1 = new A1(1, 2, 3);\r\n    var a2 = new A2(1, 4);\r\n\r\n    Assertions.assertThat(a2).usingRecursiveComparison().comparingOnlyFields(\"a\").isEqualTo(a1);\r\n    Assertions.assertThat(a1).usingRecursiveComparison().comparingOnlyFields(\"a\").isEqualTo(a2);\r\n
