it is used by default?\n\nWe would like to have methods like:\n\n```\nassertThat(<some iterable>).containsExactlyElementsOf(<some iterable>) - already provided.\nassertThat(<some iterable>).containsExactlyElementsOfComparingFieldByField(<some iterable>) - really missing\nassertThat(<some iterable>).containsExactlyElementsOfComparingFieldByFieldRecursively(<some iterable>) - missing too \n```\n\nAs suggested by @PascalSchumacher we can use:\n\n```\nassertThat((Object) Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"c\")).isEqualToComparingFieldByFieldRecursively(Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"c\"));\nassertThat((Object) Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"c\")).isEqualToComparingFieldByField(Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"c\"));\n```\n\nBut this approach works only for identical Lists - internal state of lists such as private fields other than compared objects will be compared too.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/636/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
