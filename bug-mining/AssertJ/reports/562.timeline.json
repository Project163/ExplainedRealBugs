sure.\r\n\r\nContinuing with my example above. If we have these:\r\n```java\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  LocalTime time;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass FooDto {\r\n  String time;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the new methods, the idea is that instead of this:\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(foo)\r\n  .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n  .withEqualsForType((BiPredicate<LocalTime, Object>) (time, timeStr) -> time.equals(LocalTime.parse((String) timeStr)), LocalTime.class)\r\n  .isEqualTo(fooDto);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would be able to do this:\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(foo)\r\n  .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n  .withEqualsForTypes((time, timeStr) -> time.equals(LocalTime.parse(timeStr)), LocalTime.class, String.class)\r\n  .isEqualTo(fooDto);\r\n```\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn addition, if we have something like this:\r\n```java\r\nclass Bar {\r\n  LocalTime time;\r\n  LocalDate date;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass BarDto {\r\n  String time;\r\n  String date;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we want to assert that BarDto is equal to Bar, using \"withEqualsForType\" does not work:\r\n```java\r\nDateTimeFormatter dateFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"yyyy/MM/dd\");\r\nDateTimeFormatter timeFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"HH:mm\");\r\n\r\nassertThat(barDto)\r\n    .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n    // This is overridden...\r\n    .withEqualsForType((BiPredicate<String, Object>) (dateStr, date) -> dateStr.equals(dateFormatter.format((LocalDate) date)), String.class)\r\n    // when registering this\r\n    .withEqualsForType((BiPredicate<String, Object>) (timeStr, time) -> timeStr.equals(timeFormatter.format((LocalTime) time)), String.class)\r\n    .isEqualTo(bar);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile \"withEqualsForTypes\" should be OK, because one is registered with String & LocalDate, whereas the other is registered with String & LocalTime:\r\n```java\r\n    ...\r\n    .withEqualsForTypes((dateStr, date) -> dateStr.equals(dateFormatter.format(date)), String.class, LocalDate.class)\r\n    .withEqualsForTypes((timeStr, time) -> timeStr.equals(timeFormatter.format(time)), String.class, LocalTime.class)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith objects so simple as the ones used here it is true that we can just resort to using \"withEqualsForFields\" as explained in my initial post.\r\nBut with more complex objects, where a given type is used in several fields, I think having the ability to define both actual and expected types may come handy.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1706152292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pcuriel","id":1854183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTQxODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1854183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel","html_url":"https://github.com/pcuriel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcuriel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1707327234","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3165#issuecomment-1707327234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3165","id":1707327234,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5lw78C","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-05T21:22:52Z","updated_at":"2023-09-05T21:22:52Z","body":"Yeah,

Check List:\r\n* Fixes #3165\r\n* Unit tests : YES\r\n* Javadoc with a code example (on API only) : YES\r\n\r\nAdd `RecursiveComparisonAssert.withEqualsForTypes` and `RecursiveComparisonAssert.withComparatorForTypes` methods to compare different type objects in a type-safe way. For the latter, I've added a BiComparator functional interface to avoid the declaration of a `Comparator<Object>` that requires a forced cast of the instances to be compared.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to fix the type clash generated by this kind of registration\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(actual).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                  .withComparatorForTypes(comparator1, String.class, LocalTime.class)\r\n                  .withComparatorForTypes(comparator2, String.class, LocalDate.class)\r\n```\r\nI've modified the internal TypeHolder data structure from\r\n`protected final Map<Class<?>, T> typeHolder;`\r\nto\r\n`protected final Map<Pair<Class<?>, Class<?>>, T> typeHolder;`\r\nThis allows us to associate a Comparator to a type's pair ([String, LocalTime] -> comparator1).\r\n\r\nRetro compatibility is maintained; in the following scenario\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(actual).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                  .withComparatorForType(comparator1, String.class)\r\n```\r\nThe typeHolder will contain this entry ([String, null] -> comparator1).\r\n\r\nThe only method that has changed the signature is `TypeHolder.entityByTypes` from\r\n`public Stream<Entry<Class<?>, T> entityByTypes()`\r\nto\r\n`public Stream<Entry<Pair<Class<?>, Class<?>>, T>> entityByTypes()`\r\nthat's why this **cannot be considered as a safe change**...let's talk about this\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15724237110,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs5v5QsFzwAAAAOpPNE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/15724237110","actor":{"login":"arogulin","id":1501897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1501897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin","html_url":"https://github.com/arogulin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogulin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-19T19:14:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18487674220,"node_id":"CE_lADOAIX3Vs5v5QsFzwAAAARN84Vs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/18487674220","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"cb64f618c822af850905a963c754e8b4313614e7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/commits/cb64f618c822af850905a963c754e8b4313614e7","created_at":"2025-07-05T21:44:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18487829706,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs5v5QsFzwAAAARN9eTK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/18487829706","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cb64f618c822af850905a963c754e8b4313614e7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boost-mw-poc/assertj_assertj/commits/cb64f618c822af850905a963c754e8b4313614e7","created_at":"2025-07-05T22:08:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
