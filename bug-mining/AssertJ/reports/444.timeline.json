started introducing `isNotNull` checks in some navigation methods (#2401, #2411, #2412) but this created a side effect for soft assertions.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// GIVEN\r\nSoftAssertions softly = new SoftAssertions();\r\n// WHEN\r\nsoftly.assertThat(null)\r\n      .extracting(Object::getClass) // inner isNotNull() throws AssertionError \r\n      .isEqualTo(...);\r\n// THEN\r\nthen(softly.errorsCollected()).hasSize(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nfails at `extracting` with an NPE, as the `AssertionError` thrown by `isNotNull` is swallowed by the soft assertions' error collector, and the rest of the `extracting` method is executed.\r\n\r\nA similar issue happens with `AbstractOptionalAssert::get` (reported also in #2784), which executes an `isPresent` check internally.\r\n\r\nWe need to rethink what to expect in these cases. Ideally:\r\n* `extracting` / `get` should be completed and one `AssertionError` due to `isNotNull` / `isPresent` should be collected without further failures\r\n* Any other chained assertions should be skipped without collecting additional errors\r\n\r\nThis might require some refactoring in the ByteBuddy configuration and in the `ErrorCollector` implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2495/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11610437024,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs4-yiekzwAAAAK0CTWg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/11610437024","actor":{"login":"schlosna","id":54594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna","html_url":"https://github.com/schlosna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b44f86c5f8991067550ce7bae7ad5eca1594f796","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schlosna/assertj-core/commits/b44f86c5f8991067550ce7bae7ad5eca1594f796","created_at":"2024-01-26T15:56:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14496634568,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAIX3Vs4-yiekzwAAAANgERbI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14496634568","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-02T23:39:16Z","label":{"name":"type: breaking change","color":"D4C5F9"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
