In that latter case a timeout is likely to be needed ... not as straightforward as it looks.\r\n\r\nI'm alright enriching the API maybe with something like:\r\n ```java\r\nassertThat(tokenFuture).completesWithin(timeout, unit)\r\n                        .hasValueMatching(somePredicate)\r\n                        .hasValueSatisfying(requirements);\r\n```\r\nHaving said that `completesWithin(timeout)` is something users can do themselves, it's not really assertion related.\r\n\r\nThoughts and feedback welcome.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/378425529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/418333233","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1214#issuecomment-418333233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1214","id":418333233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODMzMzIzMw==","user":{"login":"jypma","id":483519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzUxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/483519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma","html_url":"https://github.com/jypma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T11:31:03Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T11:33:16Z","body":"We ran into the same thing and ended up writing our own [`CompletionStageAssert`](https://github.com/Tradeshift/ts-reaktive/blob/master/ts-reaktive-testkit-assertj/src/main/java/com/tradeshift/reaktive/assertj/AbstractCompletionStageAssert.java#L27), with which one can e.g. write\r\n\r\n```\r\n  assertThat(tokenFuture).succeedsWith(Token.create(\"hello\"))\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n  Token success = assertThat(tokenFuture).succeeds();\r\n```\r\nor even\r\n```\r\n  assertThat(tokenFuture).success().matches(aRealToken)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does a global timeout internally, but you can configure it using `assertThat(tokenFuture).within(3, SECONDS).succeeds())`.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to submit a PR to `assertj-core` if you think it's an improvement.

for the long wait, here are my current thoughts:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(tokenFuture).completesWithin(duration)  // and/or completesWithin(timeout, unit)\r\n                       .hasValueMatching(somePredicate)\r\n                       .hasValueSatisfying(requirements);\r\n```\r\nor alternatively returning assertions on the future's result (since the future completed)\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(tokenFuture).completesWithin(duration) // and/or completesWithin(timeout, unit)           \r\n                       .matches(somePredicate)\r\n                       .satisfies(requirements);\r\n```\r\nsame assertions for failed future returning assertions on the future's exception:   \r\n```java\r\nassertThat(tokenFuture).failsWithin(duration) // and/or failsWithin(timeout, unit)           \r\n                       .hasMessage(\"boom!\")\r\n                       .hasNoCause();\r\n```\r\nmy preference goes with returning the future's result for further assertions (so not the first option) to leverage existing assertions, moreover with `asInstanceOf` it is now possible to call specific type assertions:\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(stringFuture).completesWithin(duration) // and/or completesWithin(timeout, unit)           \r\n                        .asInstanceOf(InstanceOfAssertFactories.STRING)\r\n                        .startsWith(\"foo\");\r\n```\r\nan alternative would be to pass the InstanceOfAssertFactory as the last parameter with the optional as() syntactic sugar:\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(stringFuture).completesWithin(duration, as(STRING)) \r\n                        .startsWith(\"foo\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n@jypma @almothafar @oscarfh

thoughts:\r\n\r\n- At least keep `.succeedsWithin(Duration)` as an overload. I expect many cases have a timeout-like value here, that you'd want to hide away / scale upon globally, and reuse. So sth like `.succeedsWithin(reasonableTimeout)`. As for the error message, nothing says we _have_ to use `Duration.toString()` (which, I agree, sucks).\r\n\r\n- For type-safe assertions on the type inside the future, I'd prefer the `.completesWithin(duration, as(STRING))`, since the type signature can be made to have `CompletionStage<T>` match the `T` against the type givin inside the `as()`. This will allow the compiler to already catch non-sensical typecasts (since you don't go through `Object`).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/569487127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jypma","id":483519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzUxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/483519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma","html_url":"https://github.com/jypma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jypma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
