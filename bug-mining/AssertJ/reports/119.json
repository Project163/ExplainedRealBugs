It either expects properties or fields. It seem to fail for altering combinations.\n\nI depend on a class from a lib from Google, which has a public field `file` of type `File`. If I want to extract `file.name`, where name is a method (`File#getName()`), I get the following exception:\n\n> org.assertj.core.util.introspection.IntrospectionError: \n> Can't find any field or property with name 'file.name'.\n> Error when introspecting fields was :\n> No getter for property 'file' in com.android.tools.lint.Warning \n\nHere is some example code to demonstrate the issue:\n\n``` java\nList<Warning> warnings = lint.getWarnings();   \nassertThat(warnings).extracting(\"file.name\").containsExactly(\"AndroidManifest.xml\");\n```\n\nBy the way, it succeeds when I try `file.path`, cause `path`is a field of type `File`.\n\nA look at assertj's `ByNameSingleExtractor` class seems to support my assumption (see line 48-52).\n\nSo my question is, if this is on purpose or if it is an issue?\n\nBecause when looking at other \"path reflection\" solutions, for instance at Apache's commons-lang, the resolution of nested properties always accepts anything, fields, getters, indexes, maps...\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
