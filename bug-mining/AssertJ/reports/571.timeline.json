#3810\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in `hasNoNullFields()` where fields of type `Collection`, `Map`, `Optional`, or `Array` that were `null` were not evaluated by the recursive assertion engine. As a result, the assertion passed even when some fields were actually `null`.\r\n\r\n### GIVEN / WHEN / THEN\r\n\r\n- GIVEN: an object with a `null` List, Map, Optional, or Array field\r\n- WHEN: asserting using `assertThat(obj).usingRecursiveAssertion().hasNoNullFields()`\r\n- THEN: the assertion should fail if any field is `null`, regardless of type\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nWe modified the condition in `RecursiveAssertionDriver#assertRecursively` to ensure that fields which are `null` are evaluated by the predicate, regardless of their type:\r\n\r\nif (!isRootObject(fieldLocation) &&
