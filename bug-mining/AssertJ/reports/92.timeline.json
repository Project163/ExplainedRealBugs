Summary\r\nCurrently, the error messages generated in custom assertions via `failWithMessage()` are less clear compared to similar messages from built in assertions.\r\n\r\n\tMyTuple actual = new MyTuple(new int[] { 1, 2, 3 });\r\n\tassertThat(actual).hasValue1(\"\");\r\n\r\nThis test fails with the following stack trace:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: Expected the first value of <FailWithMessageImprovements$MyTuple@6d21714c> to be <> but was <[I@108c4c35>\r\n\tat org.assertj.core.api.AbstractAssert.failWithMessage(AbstractAssert.java:111)\r\n\tat FailWithMessageImprovements$MyTupleAssert.hasValue1(FailWithMessageImprovements.java:43)\r\n\tat FailWithMessageImprovements.customAssert(FailWithMessageImprovements.java:12)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile a

message from my (trivial) custom assert\r\n- it's unclear what the values of `actual` and `expected` are\r\n- the stack trace contains elements from AssertJ and my assert\r\n\r\n\r\n### Suggestions\r\n\r\n1. ~~Add an alternative to `failWithMessage()`, that uses the same formatting as AssertJ (i.e. the same behavior as before #320, but as opt-in).\r\nThe custom assert could have pre-formatted the values via `Representation.toStringOf(Object)`, but I think creating asserts should be as convenient as possible.~~\r\nNever mind, I found `throwAssertionError(ErrorMessageFactory)`, which is exactly what I need.\r\n2. Also filter the error stack trace in `failWithMessage()`, exactly like `Failures.failure()`.\r\n3. Extend this filtering by also removing elements of the current assert class.\r\n\r\nI could contribute this, if you agree with my suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n\tpublic static class MyTuple {\r\n\t\t// ...\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic Object getValue1() {\r\n\t\t\treturn value1;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic static class MyTupleAssert extends AbstractObjectAssert<MyTupleAssert, MyTuple> {\r\n\t\t// ...\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic MyTupleAssert hasValue1(Object expected) {\r\n\t\t\tisNotNull();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (!Objects.equals(actual.getValue1(), expected)) {\r\n\t\t\t\tfailWithMessage(\"Expected the first value of <%s> to be <%s> but was <%s>\", actual, expected, actual.getValue1());\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\treturn this;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n#### Java 8 specific ?\r\n\r\n* NO  : create Pull Request from the `2.x` branch\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/873/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14496759266,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAIX3Vs4DM_RjzwAAAANgEv3i","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14496759266","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-02T23:57:26Z","label":{"name":"type: bug","color":"D4C5F9"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
