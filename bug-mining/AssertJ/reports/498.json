using `withEqualsForFieldsMatchingRegexes` and both original and compare values are null NPE is thrown in: \r\n```\r\n/assertj-core-3.24.2-sources.jar!/org/assertj/core/api/recursive/comparison/RecursiveComparisonDifferenceCalculator.java:172\r\n```\r\n`getCustomErrorMessage` does not have custom message registered and tries getting from value's class, and since value is null we get a NPE.\r\n\r\nSince `withErrorMessageForFields` does not work for regexp values there is no way to walkaround this. \r\nHaving ability to have custom message for regexp values would be also great, but I guess this is out of scope for this ticket.\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.24.2\r\n* java version:
