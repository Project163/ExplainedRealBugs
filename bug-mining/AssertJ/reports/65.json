And then I try to assert that Legolas's race name is null. But I got the exception below,\n\njava.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 2, Size: 2\n    at java.util.ArrayList.rangeCheck(ArrayList.java:638)\n    at java.util.ArrayList.get(ArrayList.java:414)\n    at java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableList.get(Collections.java:1369)\n    at org.assertj.core.groups.FieldsOrPropertiesExtractor.extract(FieldsOrPropertiesExtractor.java:108)\n    at org.assertj.core.groups.FieldsOrPropertiesExtractor.extract(FieldsOrPropertiesExtractor.java:60)\n    at org.assertj.core.api.AbstractObjectArrayAssert.extracting(AbstractObjectArrayAssert.java:422)\n\nIn fact, extracting deep attributes works well alone even with null, but it has a problem with tuple.
