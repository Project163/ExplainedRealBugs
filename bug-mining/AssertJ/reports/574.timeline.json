Feature summary\r\nWhen you have two enum classes with the same name but in different packages and compare an enum object in a list from one package with an enum object of the other package, it fails,

The fully qualified name should be added to make it easier to differentiate the two.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n`org.example.pkg1.MyEnum.java`:\r\n```java\r\npackage org.example.pkg1;\r\n\r\npublic
