the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.25.3\r\n* java version: 21.0.1-open\r\n* test framework version: JUnit 5.10.2\r\n* os (if relevant):  Linux 6.5.0-15-generic # 15-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Jan  9 17:03:36 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 23.10)\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nSome timestamp types, for example, `java.sql.Timestamp`, are not specifically handled when comparing with other temporal types, and as a result, though there are no compile-time errors caused by types, they are not effectively compared as temporals.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Demo {\r\n    @Test\r\n    void compareSqlTimestampWithInstant() {\r\n        final long now = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n        final Timestamp ts = new Timestamp(now);\r\n        final Instant instant = Instant.ofEpochMilli(now);\r\n        assertEquals(ts.getNanos(), instant.getNano()); // this succeeds\r\n        assertThat(ts).isEqualTo(instant); // this fails.\r\n        assertThat(ts).isAfterOrEqualTo(instant); // even if I want to relax the check, this still fails\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see there are javadocs mentioning that comparisons are done by converting these timestamp types to `java.util.Date`, but is there a way to make this less surprising, otherwise make it a compilation error, so the user can take care of nanoseconds?\r\n\r\n**Updated**: I thought it was caused by nano-second precision being dropped along the assertion classes, but it turns out that there is no special handling of such types, and they end up calling `Object.equals()`.","closed_by":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
