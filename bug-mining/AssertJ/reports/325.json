multiple conditions are supplied as an `Iterable` instead of as an array, the individual descriptions are lost.\r\n\r\nThe fix in 0640d1d7133bb8253d6c4da336220f6e6d77c677 only addressed multiple conditions provided as an array to `allOf()` or `anyOf()`.\r\n\r\nThe underlying cause is that `org.assertj.core.condition.Join.Join(Condition<? super T>...)` tracks descriptions; whereas, `org.assertj.core.condition.Join.Join(Iterable<? extends Condition<? super T>>)` does not track descriptions.\r\n\r\nSee also the workaround I introduced in JUnit 5:
