Summary\r\nVersion 3.22.0\r\nI expect if I use usingRecursiveComparison with usingOverriddenEquals, field \"age\" should be ignored.\r\nBut as result I get\r\n\r\n> java.lang.AssertionError: \r\n> Expecting actual:\r\n>   com.ComparatorDevices$Person@63be0d6\r\n> to be equal to:\r\n>   com.ComparatorDevices$Person@63be0b6\r\n> when recursively comparing field by field, but found the following difference:\r\n> \r\n> field/property 'age' differ:\r\n> - actual value  : \"22\"\r\n> - expected value: \"11\"\r\n> \r\n> The recursive comparison was performed with this configuration:\r\n> - overridden equals methods were used in the comparison\r\n> - these types were compared with the following comparators:\r\n>   - java.lang.Double -> DoubleComparator[precision=1.0E-15]\r\n>   - java.lang.Float -> FloatComparator[precision=1.0E-6]\r\n>   - java.nio.file.Path -> lexicographic comparator (Path natural order)\r\n> - actual and expected objects and their fields were compared field by field recursively even if they were not of the same type, this allows for example to compare a Person to a PersonDto (call strictTypeChecking(true) to change that behavior).\r\n\r\n####
