wikipedia site surprised me. I didn't know that switching the order of the parameters is permitted by the standard to be significant.\r\n\r\nI think you are on the right track with the normalisation idea. isEqualToWithNormalisation() sounds good. However, looking at that site, there are a lot of possible normalisations. Which ones are you referring to? Do you want to program them all in? Removing duplicate slashes sounds good. Technically you should also make http and https equivalent, according to one of the items in that list. I suspect that we don't want this. In any case, it all sounds like a a lot of work.\r\n\r\nMaybe we shouldn't use the term \"normalisation\" unless we are implementing all normalisations, or can at least make a logical statement about which ones.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the list and see what you think. My initial thought is: You could do all the \"normalisations that preserve semantics\" but not the others. For the others, you might need to name them separately. Since the only one anyone is asking for at the moment is query parameter sorting, we should probably just focus on this for now.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a `isEqualToWithSortedQueryParameters()` might do the trick. Or since there are possibly more operations which could be performed in the future, maybe we should go back to the two-step-idea: `withSortedQueryParameters().isEqualTo()`.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/598085623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fletchgqc","id":378518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/378518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc","html_url":"https://github.com/fletchgqc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fletchgqc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/598092360","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1796#issuecomment-598092360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1796","id":598092360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODA5MjM2MA==","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T09:36:17Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T09:36:30Z","body":"Fair
