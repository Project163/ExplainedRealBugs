I was able to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug in `containsExactly` implementation that assumes the comparison of elements is symmetrical but the recursive comparison  is not! It compares actual's fields vs expected fields and fails if expected does not have all actual fields (without even needing to compare their values).\r\n\r\nIn your example, we can compare `ListEntryDto` to `ListEntry` because `ListEntry` has all fields of `ListEntryDto` (and an additional one: `randomProperty`) but comparing `ListEntry` to `ListEntryDto` will always fail as `ListEntryDto` does not have a `randomProperty` field. This explains why commenting `randomProperty` made the test to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe best option for you right now is to use:\r\n```java\r\n    assertThat(actualResultList).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                                .isEqualTo(list(le1, le2, le3, le4));\r\n```\r\nwhich has the benefit to be more elegant - IMO at least ;-)\r\n\r\nThis bug affects also `usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator(RecursiveComparisonConfiguration)`  so this does not work either:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   assertThat(actualResultList).asList()\r\n                                .hasSize(4)\r\n                                .usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator(RecursiveComparisonConfiguration.builder().build())\r\n                                .containsExactly(le1, le2, le3,
