have two tests whether an actual value is within a given percentage of the expected value.\n\nThe test for a positive expected value works without problems.\nThe test for a negative expected value

checkNegativeNumber() {\n    assertThat(-11d).isCloseTo(-10d, withinPercentage(10));\n}\n```\n\nI've tested only for doubles but I suspect the same problem exists for all numeric
