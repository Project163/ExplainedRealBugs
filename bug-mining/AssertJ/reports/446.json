Summary\r\nGiven junit 5 on the classpath, `org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError`s  in `assertAll` method are cloned to be decorated with line numbers. During `org.assertj.core.api.DefaultAssertionErrorCollector#createNewInstanceWithLineNumberInErrorMessage` expected/actual values of  assertion failures are not restored though. Thus IntelliJ is unable to display `Click to see difference` link with diff.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nimport org.assertj.core.api.JUnitSoftAssertions\r\nimport org.junit.Rule\r\nimport org.junit.Test\r\nimport org.junit.runner.RunWith\r\nimport org.junit.runners.JUnit4\r\n@RunWith(JUnit4::class)\r\nclass MyTest {\r\n    @get:Rule\r\n    val softly: JUnitSoftAssertions = JUnitSoftAssertions()\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun t() {\r\n        softly.assertThat(\"foo\").describedAs(\"foo == bar\").isEqualTo(\"bar\")\r\n        softly.assertThat(42).describedAs(\"42 == 43\").isEqualTo(43)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2437/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
