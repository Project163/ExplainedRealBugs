Summary\r\nWhen comparing different classes and specifying `comparingOnlyFields` the assertion could fail if the class `actual` has more fields than the class of `expected` even when those fields were not specified for comparison. The example below compares two objects twice, only reversing which one is `actual` and which one is `expected`. The first assertion passes and the second fails. I'd expect that both pass, or at least that both fail.\r\n\r\nRemoving `comparingOnlyFields` and setting the same value for `b` similarly results in failure only for the second assertion, but I'm not sure if this is intended or not.\r\n\r\nI've tested it with 3.21.0 and 3.22.0.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ComparingOnlyTest {\r\n  static class A1 {\r\n    public final int a, b, c;\r\n    public A1(int a, int b, int c) {\r\n      this.a = a;\r\n      this.b = b;\r\n      this.c = c;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  static class A2 {\r\n    public final int a, b;\r\n    public A2(int a, int b) {\r\n      this.a = a;\r\n      this.b = b;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testComparingOnly() {\r\n    var a1 = new A1(1, 2, 3);\r\n    var a2 = new A2(1, 4);\r\n\r\n    Assertions.assertThat(a2).usingRecursiveComparison().comparingOnlyFields(\"a\").isEqualTo(a1);\r\n    Assertions.assertThat(a1).usingRecursiveComparison().comparingOnlyFields(\"a\").isEqualTo(a2);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1124841596","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2610#issuecomment-1124841596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2610","id":1124841596,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5DC7h8","user":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-12T10:46:50Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T10:46:50Z","body":"Thanks for the detailed example, @rd-martin-bonev!
