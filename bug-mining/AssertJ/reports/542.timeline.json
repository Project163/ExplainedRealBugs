ated_at":"2015-11-14T04:27:54Z","updated_at":"2015-11-14T04:27:54Z","body":"OK. Here goes. Mind you, I am doing this all inside IDEA so the text is not exactly like what you get from the command line (IDEA JUnit plugin adds some lines of its own). The example test class looks like this:\n\n``` java\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;\n\n/**\n * example of a test with as()\n */\npublic class AssertJExample {\n    /**\n     * Tests as()\n     */\n    @Test\n    public void testAs() throws Exception {\n        int x = 1;\n        assertThat(x<0).isTrue().as(\"X has the wrong value. Expected to be negative.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is written to fail, obviously. Here's the relevant part of the output (skipping lots of noise):\n\n> com.moscona.util.async.furtures.AssertJExample\n> org.junit.ComparisonFailure: \n> Expected :true\n> Actual   :false\n> ...\n> at com.moscona.util.async.furtures.AssertJExample.testAs(AssertJExample.java:33)\n> ...\n\nThis output has no trace of the description provided in the `as()` method. I would expect to get something along the lines of:\n\n> com.moscona.util.async.furtures.AssertJExample\n> org.junit.ComparisonFailure: \n> Expected :true\n> Actual   :false\n> \n> Described as: \"X has the wrong value. Expected to be negative.\"\n> ...\n> at com.moscona.util.async.furtures.AssertJExample.testAs(AssertJExample.java:33)\n> ...\n\nThe error without the description in the output is often cryptic. It just tells you what comparison failed, but nothing else. When using soft asserts, the problem is compounded. When the description is not present you cannot really distinguish which assertion failed without referring to the source. Suppose, for instance that we had 3 soft assertions and they were all boolean expectations. One or two failed, but which one(s)?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/156625485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"arnonmoscona","id":17976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona","html_url":"https://github.com/arnonmoscona","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnonmoscona/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/156636163","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/523#issuecomment-156636163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/523","id":156636163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjYzNjE2Mw==","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-14T05:24:50Z","updated_at":"2015-11-14T05:24:50Z","body":"You
