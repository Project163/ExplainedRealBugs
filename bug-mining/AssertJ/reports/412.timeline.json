Users that wanted to soft assert could still do so within the `assertWith` block.\r\n\r\n`satisfies` is a good name when the lambda it is passed is a variable and reused multiple times:\r\n\r\n    assertThat(team.getPlayers().get(0).getStats()).satisfies(pointsInStandardRange);\r\n    assertThat(team.getPlayers().get(1).getStats()).satisfies(pointsInStandardRange);\r\n\r\nBut it is a less good name when you simply want to group some things together inline. In some ways `assertWith` is an imperfect way to get a language change. Groovy has [with](https://mrhaki.blogspot.com/2009/09/groovy-goodness-with-method.html) blocks which turns the target into the equivalent of `this`. And this is why the suggestion uses the name `assertWith`, to match similar features in other languages. (Although `with()` might be clearer to read, it is so short I worried it might clash with other projects, hence I suggested `assertWith`).\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/505342764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4154283591,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQxNTQyODM1OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/4154283591","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-29T10:41:06Z","milestone":{"title":"3.20"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4355869518,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ0MzU1ODY5NTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/4355869518","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-21T01:24:35Z","assignee":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4355999640,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ND
