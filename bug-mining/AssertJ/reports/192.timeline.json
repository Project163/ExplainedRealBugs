element collection assertion would be a nice thing to have indeed !\nUnfortunately I see two problems : \n- assertj-core does not have dependencies, thus guava is not available \n- even if Guava was available, I think it is too much work to get the unique element assertion started\n\nIdeally I would have something like:\n\n``` java\nCollection<String> results = /*...*/;\nassertThat(results).uniqueElement().startsWith(\"foo\");\n```\n\nWhich is possible but can only return Object assertion, not very useful ... :crying_cat_face:\n\nOther possible approaches \n\nWhat about these other Java 8 only approaches:\n\nOption 1 : use a `Predicate`\n\n``` java\nassertThat(jedis).hasOnlyOneElementMatching(jedi -> jedi.name.equals(\"Yo! da\"), \"check name\");\n// with default check description == given\nassertThat(jedis).hasOnlyOneElementMatching(jedi -> jedi.name.equals(\"Yo! da\"));\n```\n\nThe first assertion fails with the following error message\n\n```\nExpecting:\n  <Jedi[id=1, name='Yoda', age=800]>\nto match \"check name\" predicate.\n```\n\nThe second fails too with `given` replacing `\"check name\"` in the error message.\n\nOption 2 : use a `Consumer` to let user use `assertThat` in the lambda\n\n``` java\nassertThat(jedis).hasOnlyOneElementSatisfying(jedi ->  {\n      assertThat(jedi.name).isEqualTo(\"Yoda\");\n      assertThat(jedi.age).isEqualTo(800);\n    });\n```\n\nIn that case no check description needed as we get the failed assertion error message (if any).\n\nOption 3 : ship with both options ;-)\n\nThoughts

a back ground issue from our project here: \nhttps://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues/5925\n\nthe general idea is we want to generate helper methods in the generated Assert classes to aid navigation through deeply nested models. The background is the Kubernetes model is very deeply nested. \n\nFor a complex model where you want to write assertions like:\n\n```\nassertThat(foo.getBar().getThing()).isNotNull()\n```\n\nthe problem is the getBar() could return null as could the getThing(). \n\nSo we wanna do this instead...\n\n```\nassertThat(foo).bar().thing().isNotNull();\n```\n\nwhere each property method `bar()` and `thing()` are kinda like the `hasBar()` function thats generated OOTB, only it returns the assertThat() of the value. So the last assertion - `.isNotNull()` could be anything really; `isEqualTo()` or whatever.\n\ne.g. we generate functions like this:\n\n```\nclass FooAssert ... {\n\n   public BarAssert bar() {\n      isNotNull();\n\n      return (BarAssert) assertThat(actual.getBar()).describedAs(toString() + \".bar\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI've managed to implement the above in our project using the extensible templates (thanks for that!) - but to do so I needed to add the above 2 properties to the templates. Actually as of writing only the 2nd one is required but figured I may as well submit a PR for both
