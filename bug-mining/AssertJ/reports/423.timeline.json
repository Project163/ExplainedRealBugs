I ran your test cases with on the latest main commit, both test don't show any stack trace.\r\n\r\nThe final assertion error thrown is `AssertJMultipleFailuresError` which aggregates all caught errors but don't show any the stack trace because it would clutter the overall error message (similar to opentest4j `MultipleFailuresError`).\r\n\r\nNow the question is what would you like to see in the
