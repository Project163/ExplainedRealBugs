Summary\n\nHi,\nI have proposal of some improvement regarding field assertions on single object.\nNow when some type is not known we can do following assert:\n#### Example\n\n``` java\nassertThat(throwable).isInstanceOf(MyException.class);\nassertThat(((MyException) throwable).getErrorCode())\n        .isEqualTo(someCode);\n```\n\nwhat do you think to add feature which would avoid to cast explicitly ?, for example:\n\n``` java\nassertThat(throwable).isInstanceOf(MyException.class).extracting(\"errorCode\").isEqualTo(someCode);\n```\n\nIt could work in similar way as 'extract' for collections.\n\nThanks,\nTomek\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/730/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/730/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"aaiezza","id":8107121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDcxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8107121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza","html_url":"https://github.com/aaiezza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaiezza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T16:22:09Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T16:22:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1461","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1461/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1461/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1461/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1461","id":418396284,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTgzOTYyODQ=","number":1461,"title":"Change
