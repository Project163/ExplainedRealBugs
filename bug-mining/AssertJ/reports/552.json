the bug**\r\n`catchThrowableOfType` tries to catch an exception of specific type, and correctly fails if the type is wrong. However, if no exception is raised, it returns null, and does not fail.\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.23.1\r\n* java version: 11 or 17\r\n* test framework version: junit-jupiter-api 5.8.2\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nTest case showing that a wrong type is correctly caught:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Test\r\n  void testWrongType() {\r\n    final IOException e = catchThrowableOfType(() -> {throw new RuntimeException(\"\");}, IOException.class);\r\n\r\n    var s = e.toString(); // simulates extracting a field manually from that home-made exception\r\n    assertThat(e).hasMessage(\"never reaches\");\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will fail like so:\r\n\r\n```text\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting actual throwable to be an instance of:\r\n  java.io.IOException\r\nbut was:\r\n  java.lang.RuntimeException:\r\n(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if no exception is thrown, the test will fail with an NPE:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Test\r\n  void testNoException() {\r\n    final IOException e = catchThrowableOfType(() -> System.out.println(\"hello\"), IOException.class);\r\n\r\n    var s = e.toString();\r\n    assertThat(e).hasMessage(\"NPE just before\");\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd its output:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhello\r\n\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n** Expected Behaviour **\r\n\r\nAnytime a test is using `catchThrowableOfType`, and no exception is thrown, then there is no point in silently returning null, because an exception is expected in the first place.\r\n\r\nI would expect a message such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting actual throwable to be an instance of:\r\n  java.io.IOException\r\nbut was no exception was thrown.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose it all comes from line 71 of https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/blob/main/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/api/ThrowableAssert.java as far as I could tell, not really sure how to fix this.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2706/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
