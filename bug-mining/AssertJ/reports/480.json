Summary\r\n\r\nThe recursive comparison would benefit from a clear introspection strategy when gathering the field to compare and getting their values.\r\n\r\nThe recursive comparison is a bit inconsistent, it introspects fields to get the list of fields to compare but uses a different strategy to read their values by looking first to a getter then reading the field directly or looking for a map value (key being the field name).\r\n\r\nThe IntrospectionStrategy would define what to compare and how to read the values to compare.\r\n\r\nThis is needed for: \r\n*
