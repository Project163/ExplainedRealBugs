Summary\r\n`isEqualToComparingFieldByFieldRecursively` is not symmetrical when a field of subclass type is populated with an object with a superclass type using reflection. \r\n\r\n(this may sound as an obscure use case, but such 'mistakes' tend to happen with mapping/serialization libraries, which use reflection heavily. It just happened to me with Orika, for one)\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\r\n\r\nimport java.lang.reflect.Field;\r\nimport org.junit.Test;\r\n\r\npublic class AssertJEqualityTest {\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void isEqualToComparingFieldByFieldRecursively_shouldBeSymmetrical()\r\n      throws NoSuchFieldException, IllegalAccessException {\r\n    //given\r\n    final ReferencingClass actual = new ReferencingClass();\r\n    actual.setReferenced(new ChildClass());\r\n    final ReferencingClass expected = new ReferencingClass();\r\n    Field referencedField = ReferencingBaseClass.class.getDeclaredField(\"referenced\");\r\n    referencedField.setAccessible(true);\r\n    referencedField.set(expected, new BaseClass());\r\n    //then\r\n    assertThat(expected).isEqualToComparingFieldByFieldRecursively(actual);\r\n    assertThat(actual).isEqualToComparingFieldByFieldRecursively(expected);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass BaseClass {\r\n  private String fieldA = \"fieldA\";\r\n  private String fieldB = \"fieldB\";\r\n\r\n  public String getFieldA() {\r\n    return fieldA;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setFieldA(String fieldA) {\r\n    this.fieldA = fieldA;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public String getFieldB() {\r\n    return fieldB;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setFieldB(String fieldB) {\r\n    this.fieldB = fieldB;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ChildClass extends BaseClass {\r\n  private String fieldC = \"fieldC\";\r\n\r\n  public String getFieldC() {\r\n    return fieldC;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setFieldC(String fieldC) {\r\n    this.fieldC = fieldC;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ReferencingBaseClass<T extends BaseClass> {\r\n  private T referenced;\r\n\r\n  public T getReferenced() {\r\n    return referenced;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setReferenced(T referenced) {\r\n    this.referenced = referenced;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ReferencingClass extends ReferencingBaseClass<ChildClass> {\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, only the second assertion fails. It is a bit similar to [this issue](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/1054). The test case above shows, though, that one side of the comparison is favoured when AssertJ checks whether the two objects have the same fields.
