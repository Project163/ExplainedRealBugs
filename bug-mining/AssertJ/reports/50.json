when asserting object we have a few useful methods:\n\n``` java\nassertThat(object).isEqualToComparingFieldByField()\nassertThat(object).isEqualToComparingOnlyGivenFields()\nassertThat(object).isEqualToIgnoringGivenFields()\n```\n\nBut it is not possible to use similiar comparison methods when using iterable assert.\nIt is possible to get the same effect using\n.usingElementComparator() but this requires a lot of code to write such a comparator.\n\nI think it will be useful to have methods:\n\n``` java\nassertThat(iterable).usingFieldByFieldComparator().contains...\nassertThat(iterable).usingGivenFieldsComparator(String... givenFields).contains...\nassertThat(iterable).usingIgnoringFieldsComparator(String... fieldsToIgnore).contains...\n```\n\nalternatively it could be that there are some factory methods for such a strategies that returns a Comparator instances.\n\nit would then look like this:\n\n``` java\nassertThat(iterable).usingElementComparator(Comparators.fieldByFieldComparator())...\n```\n\nbut i think previous example is much better int terms of API usability.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/116/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
