Summary\r\nHello! Let me thank the creators of this wonderful framework once again.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we have the option \"ignoringActualNullFields/isEqualToIgnoringNullFields (for null actuals too)\".\r\nIn addition to this, it would be nice to have the same option for Expected Null fields.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nIt is an often case to fill some fields only during the test.\r\nFor example, entity ID - it is created dynamically.\r\nI send an object with null ID and during the test it gets some value. And there could me many such dynamic-filled fields.\r\nSo, I would like to compare expected and actual objects and exclude all that fields, which were null before the test, from comparison, so that [expected = null & actual = not null] would be ignored. \r\n\r\nIs it possible? We would be very grateful!","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
