Summary\r\nAdd isCloseTo assertion for java.time.Duration\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(Duration.ofSeconds(59)).isCloseTo(Duration.ofMinutes(1), within(Duration.ofSeconds(10)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementation could probably just be a facade that simply does `duration.toMillis()`, and delegates to `LongAssert`.  This will likely need a new Offset class, e.g. `DurationOffset` to support the `offset` parameter to `isCloseTo`.\r\n\r\n**Note** I considered genericizing this to adding isCloseTo for `java.time.TemporalAmount` which would encompass both `Duration` and `Period`, but periods are a bit different as they can't directly be converted down to something like millis.  Their lowest precision is a day, different days potentially  have different numbers of seconds, etc....so the `isCloseTo` algorithm would have to be different for them.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1942/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
