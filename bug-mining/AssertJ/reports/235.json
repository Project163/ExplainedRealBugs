Summary\r\n\r\nVariation of `containsExactlyInAnyOrder` with an `Iterable` parameter.\r\nThe assertion is named `containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf` for consistency with the API (ex `containsExactlyElementsOf`).\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// an Iterable is used in the example but it would also work with an array\r\nIterable<Ring> elvesRings = newArrayList(vilya, nenya, narya, vilya);\r\nIterable<Ring> elvesRingsSomeMissing = newArrayList(vilya, nenya, narya);\r\nIterable<Ring> elvesRingsDifferentOrder = newArrayList(nenya, narya, vilya, vilya);\r\n\r\n // assertion will pass\r\n assertThat(elvesRings).containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf(elvesRingsDifferentOrder);\r\n\r\n // assertion will fail as vilya is contained twice in elvesRings.\r\n assertThat(elvesRings).containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf(elvesRingsSomeMissing);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Java 8 specific ?\r\n\r\n* NO  : create Pull Request from the `2.x` branch\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1009/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
