I think that this broke in https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/commit/1fe35a246c917373dca4345137ca5d7044e14276 because `JsonNode` implements `Iterable<JsonNode>`.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these changes is that all object nodes are rendered as `[]` in the output.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void simpleTest() {\r\n  JsonNode a = JsonNodeFactory.instance.objectNode().put(\"a\", 1);\r\n  JsonNode b = JsonNodeFactory.instance.objectNode().put(\"b\", 2);\r\n  assertThat(a).isEqualTo(b);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 3.17.1 output\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting:\r\n <\"[[]] (ObjectNode@1dd02175)\">\r\nto be equal to:\r\n <\"[[]] (ObjectNode@31206beb)\">\r\nbut was not.\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 3.16.1 output\r\n```\r\norg.junit.ComparisonFailure: \r\nExpected :{\"b\":2}\r\nActual   :{\"a\":1}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
