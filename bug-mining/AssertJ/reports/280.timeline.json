Summary\r\n\r\nAssertJ support in OSGi is pretty good. However, due to the funky classloading tricks that it uses (particularly with assumptions and soft assertions) you can sometimes run into issues. Searching the issues for \"OSGi\" will reveal a number of them (some of them still open). In the osgi-test project, we have recently hit a similar issue (osgi/osgi-test#118).\r\n\r\nThis suggestion has been made before (https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/1290#issue-348166619) that we include integration tests in AssertJ that exercise the OSGi nature of AssertJ to guard against regressions and catch problems early. I think it would be nice to capture this in a dedicated issue.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nNothing concrete yet, but in osgi-test we are going to try and achieve it by migrating the tests for our custom AssertJ assertions to leverage the Bndtools M2E integration for running integration tests inside an OSGi framework (osgi/osgi-test#121). If it works well, perhaps we consider adding this in some form to the AssertJ build. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1888/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
