[`assertThat(Iterable, AssertFactory)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.assertj/assertj-core/latest/org/assertj/core/api/Assertions.html#assertThat(java.lang.Iterable,org.assertj.core.api.AssertFactory)) and [`assertThat(Iterable, Class)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.assertj/assertj-core/latest/org/assertj/core/api/Assertions.html#assertThat(ACTUAL,java.lang.Class)) have been added in version 3.5.0 to aid the creation of type-specific assertions for the elements of an `Iterable` instance.\r\n\r\nToday, it's possible to write the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nIterable<String> hobbits = Set.of(\"frodo\", \"sam\", \"Pippin\");\r\n\r\n// with AssertFactory\r\nassertThat(hobbits, StringAssert::new).first()\r\n                                      .startsWith(\"fro\")\r\n                                      .endsWith(\"do\");\r\n\r\n// with Class\r\nassertThat(hobbits, StringAssert.class).first()\r\n                                       .startsWith(\"fro\")\r\n                                       .endsWith(\"do\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, with the introduction of `InstanceOfAssertFactory` in version 3.13.0 and the corresponding `first(InstanceOfAssertFactory)` variant in version 3.14.0, the above can be rewritten as:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(hobbits).first(STRING) // static import of InstanceOfAssertFactories.STRING\r\n                   .startsWith(\"fro\")\r\n                   .endsWith(\"do\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of the latter is easier discoverability therefore we should deprecate the two `assertThat` entry points.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
