It would be really nice to have an `assertThatNoException` method, so that exception tests can consistently lead with the assertion.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\n```java\r\nassertThatIllegalArgumentException().isThrownBy(() -> new Foo(null, \"bar\"));\r\nassertCode(() -> new Foo(\"foo\", null)).doesNotThrowAnyException();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWanted:\r\n```java\r\nassertThatIllegalArgumentException().isThrownBy(() -> new Foo(null, \"bar\"));\r\nassertThatNoException().isThrownBy(() -> new Foo(\"foo\", null));\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1962/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
