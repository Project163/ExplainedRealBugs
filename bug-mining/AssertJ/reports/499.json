Summary\r\n\r\nI noticed that in your `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, you mention to use Eclipse formatting preferences and there is an Eclipse Formatter file with all the rules defined. However, the style of the code is not actually checked with the Continuous Integration workflows. \r\n\r\nSince the Eclipse Formatter file with all the rules already exists, it should be pretty straightforward to use [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/plugin-maven/README.md) - this could then be used as a maven command by users and it could be easily integrated as another workflow to check PRs. \r\n\r\nLet me know if this is something that you'd want for the project, I would love to pick it up :)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2530/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
