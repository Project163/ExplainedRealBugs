If such a solution is possible (I think it is but we need to try it to be sure), I'm ok to create the module. What I don't want here is to duplicate code because it would be a pain to maintain ... but I like the idea which is clearly in AssertJ philosophy that is providing assertions for the most used types.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/33240145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/48015291","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/158#issuecomment-48015291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/158","id":48015291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDE1Mjkx","user":{"login":"airborn","id":68899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn","html_url":"https://github.com/airborn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airborn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-04T07:20:38Z","updated_at":"2014-07-04T07:20:38Z","body":"+1
