instead of `equals` to compare them.\r\nAs per [Double.equals](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals-java.lang.Object-) javadoc:\r\n> If d1 and d2 both represent Double.NaN, then the equals method returns true, even though Double.NaN==Double.NaN has the value false. \r\n\r\nThe error message is a bit confusing in that it shows `Double`, this certainly can be
