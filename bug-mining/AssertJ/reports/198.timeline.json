sorry for the confusion, but currently I am working on another tester-library, so I don't have time for this right now.\nIt would be nice If you could implement this solution.\nNext time I'll try to help you :)\n\nPS the eclipse formatter is really poor (I use IntelliJ, which has much more options) and when I import eclipse formatter, intellij overrides some options, but the rest is unmodified, so importing eclipse formatter to intellij is not good solution.\nThere is eclipse formatter plugin for intellij, but if you use it you lost a lot of helpful formatting options, which I think, should be used in every project.\n\nMy recommendation is to use intellij instead of eclipse, but of course I dont push you :smiley: \n\nPS2\nThanks for giving me a try
