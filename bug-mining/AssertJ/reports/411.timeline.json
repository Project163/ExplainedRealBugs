point of the javadoc is to illustrate the assertion behavior, in order to do that we use shortcuts for data initialization otherwise most of the code examples would be for setting up data instead of focusing on the assertions.\r\n\r\nWe will clarify the javadoc but we won't add or expose `mapOf` as it's not the AssertJ's job to provide map factory methods (exposing entry is different in the sense it is used in some assertions parameter).\r\n\r\nIf you need one I suggest to use guava `ImmutableMap.of` or from Java 9 also
