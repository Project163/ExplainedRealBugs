Summary\r\nAbstractCompletableFutureAssert has methods to run assertions on CompletableFutures.\r\nHowever, in any given unit test, the given CompletableFuture might not have completed yet, causing the test to be brittle. The exception report can be quite confusing because between the test  failure and the printing of the test error, the future might complete. So even a test asserting isDone() can fail with a message showing a done future.\r\n\r\nCoding around this is ugly. Would be real nice if assertj had some waiting (with timeout, with default timeout) function embedded.\r\n\r\nAlso would be nice if this would work with CompletionStages as well.\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```\r\nCompletionStage<Foo> fooStage = getFoo();\r\nassertThat(fooStage).completesWithin(1000).hasFailedWithThrowableThat()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: I think the awaitility library could also help, but so far did not use it. Could be this is better solved by using both awaitility and assertj.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1010/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"tkruse","id":1525116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse","html_url":"https://github.com/tkruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T03:58:43Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T03:58:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1012","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1012/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1012/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1012/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/pull/1012","id":236373981,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTI1OTU1MjU1","number":1012,"title":"add
