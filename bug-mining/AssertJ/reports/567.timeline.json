Description\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the clarity of error messages when no exception is thrown by a lambda passed to isThrownBy.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the failure message simply stated that “code should raise a throwable,” which could be vague in some contexts.\r\nNow, the message explicitly mentions the expected exception type, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExpecting code to throw java.lang.IllegalArgumentException, but no exception was thrown.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change enhances the developer experience by providing more precise feedback during assertion failures, especially when working with soft assertions or parameterized exception checks.\r\n\r\nI also updated related tests to align with the new message format.\r\n\r\n#### Check List:\r\n* Fixes #3845\r\n* Unit tests : YES / NO / NA\r\n* Javadoc with a code example (on API only) : YES / NO / NA\r\n\r\nFollowing the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) will make it easier for us to review and accept your
