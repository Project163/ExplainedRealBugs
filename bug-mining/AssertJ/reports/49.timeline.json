JUnit rules are great! Thanks for making SoftAssertions even easier to use.\n\nNow, I use TestNG and it's awesome most of the time. However, in TestNG when an `@AfterMethod` method throws an exception TestNG skips all subsequent tests. As a result - and as far as I'm aware - there's no way to emulate this behaviour with TestNG.\n\n@joel-costigliola I know this problem has nothing to do with AssertJ. That said, do think there may be a good place to document this behaviour in AssertJ to save some time for those who would try to combine AssertJ and TestNG together in this way?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/32932149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brianlaframboise","id":970158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/970158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise","html_url":"https://github.com/brianlaframboise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianlaframboise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":87640373,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODc2NDAzNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/87640373","actor":{"login":"zeitlinger","id":2832627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2832627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger","html_url":"https://github.com/zeitlinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-01-21T18:54:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":87640374,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg3NjQwMzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/87640374","actor":{"login":"zeitlinger","id":2832627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2832627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger","html_url":"https://github.com/zeitlinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeitlinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-01-21T18:54:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":87640375,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODc2NDAzNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/87640375","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commi
