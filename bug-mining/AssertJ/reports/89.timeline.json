\nAs per https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/258 I should be able to extract values by keys in Map objects. \n\nI'm wondering now if I can do something with the same level of convenience with JSONObjects as well, since they behave to some extent in a very similar way.\n\nAssuming I have following JSON Array of JSON Objects:\n\n```\nJSONArray symbolList;\n\n// [{\"symbol\":\"AAPL\",\"companyName\":\"Apple Inc\"},{\"symbol\":\"AA\",\"companyName\":\"Alcoa Inc.\"},{\"symbol\":\"AAL\",\"companyName\":\"American Airlines Group Inc.\"},{\"symbol\":\"AAP\",\"companyName\":\"Advance Auto Parts Inc.\"}]\n```\n\nI'd like to iterate (which AssertJ does) and verify extracting values by key name:\n\n```\nassertThat(symbolList).extracting(\"symbol\").contains(\"AAPL\");\n```\n\nCurrently it results in following exception:\n\n```\n(org.assertj.core.util.introspection.IntrospectionError: \nCan't find any field or property with name 'symbol'.\nError when introspecting fields was :\n- No getter for property 'symbol' in org.json.simple.JSONObject \nError when introspecting properties was :\n- Unable to obtain the value of the field <'symbol'> from <{\"symbol\":\"AAPL\",\"companyName\":\"Apple Inc\"}>)\n```\n\nIs there any way to make it work given the fact that getting the value is like that:\n\n```\n        JSONObject symbolObject = (JSONObject) symbolList.get(1);\n        String symbol = (String) symbolObject.get(\"symbol\");\n        assertThat(symbol).contains(\"AAPL\");\n```\n\nNote: I'm using com.googlecode.json-simple 1.1.1 now to work with JSON.\n\nIn general I would also reconsider decision on https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/75 What's currently recommended way/library to work with AssertJ and JSON objects?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/484/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
