Summary\r\n\r\nThe recursive does not set field location properly for maps and thus is not evaluating ignored fields rules properly.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMap<String, Object> mapA = Map.of(\"foo\", \"bar\", \r\n                                  \"description\", \"foobar\", \r\n                                  \"submap\", Map.of(\"subFoo\", \"subBar\", \"description\", \"subFooBar\"));\r\nMap<String, Object> mapB = Map.of(\"foo\", \"bar\", \r\n                                  \"description\", \"barfoo\", \r\n                                  \"submap\", Map.of(\"subFoo\", \"subBar\", \"description\", \"subBarFoo\"));\r\n\r\n// should work but fails\r\nassertThat(mapA).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                .ignoringFields(\"description\", \"submap.description\")\r\n                .isEqualTo(mapB);\r\nassertThat(mapA).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                .ignoringFieldsMatchingRegexes(\".*description\")\r\n                .isEqualTo(mapB);\r\n```\r\nwith the above maps, AssertJ should compare these fields (fieldname: actual value vs expected value)\r\n\r\n* foo : bar vs bar \r\n* description : foobar vs barfor\r\n* submap.subfoo: subBar vs subBar\r\n* submap.description: subFooBar vs subBarFoo\r\n\r\ninstead it compares actual expected values without field location:\r\n\r\n* \"\" : bar vs bar \r\n* \"\" : foobar vs barfor\r\n* \"\": subBar vs subBar\r\n* \"\": subFooBar vs subBarFoo\r\n\r\nThe fix consists in properly setting the field location to the entry

the bug**\r\nWhen recursively comparing two lists that are equal, the last expected element is not found in the actual list of elements.

(No changes to tests or code have been done for this upgrade.)\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nSadly, I could not reproduce the bug on a smaller dataset.

configuration:\r\n- the following fields were ignored in the comparison: bpna, bpnLegalEntity, bpnSite\r\n- the following types were ignored in the comparison: java.time.Instant, java.time.LocalDateTime\r\n- no equals methods were used in the comparison EXCEPT for java JDK types since introspecting JDK types is forbidden in java 17+ (use withEqualsForType to register a specific way to compare a JDK type if you need it)\r\n- collection order was ignored in all fields in the comparison\r\n- these types were compared with the following comparators:\r\n  - java.lang.Double -> DoubleComparator[precision=1.0E-15]\r\n  - java.lang.Float -> FloatComparator[precision=1.0E-6]\r\n  - java.nio.file.Path -> lexicographic comparator (Path natural order)\r\n- actual and expected objects and their fields were compared field by field recursively even if they were not of the same type, this allows for example to compare a Person to a PersonDto (call strictTypeChecking(true) to change that behavior).\r\n- the introspection strategy used was: DefaultRecursiveComparisonIntrospectionStrategy\r\n```\r\n\r\nComparison Code:\r\n```kotlin\r\nassertThat(actuals).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .ignoringFields(\r\n                LogisticAddressVerboseDto::bpna.name,\r\n

\"bpnSite\" and the \"createdAt\" and \"updatedAt\" timestamps which are ignored due to ignoring the Instant field type.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bug itself seems to be quite fickle as the comparison succeeds when changing certain comparison options. However, we could not reliably reproduce which configuration leads to the bug actually. For example removing ignoring the collection order now successfully compares the lists as equal: (In that test the elements of two collections are actually in the correct
