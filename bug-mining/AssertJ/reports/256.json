Summary\r\nSoftAssertions output errors including a stack trace element for each error message.\r\n```The following assertion failed:\r\n1) [error-message]\r\nat [stack-trace-element]\r\n2) [error-message]\r\nat [stack-trace-element]\r\n```\r\nWith assertj soft assertions this works great and the stack-trace-element allows to jumb directly into at the assertion call in the test class.\r\nHowever when using a custom class soft assertions and this class is declared in a non assertj package e.g. \"org.example.project.assertions\" the stack-trace-element is from the ByteBuddy proxied assertion class.\r\nSo the output is something like\r\n```\r\nat MyProjectClassAssert$ByteBuddy$zSZUiQrB$auxiliary$7Qx1CRh1.call(MyProjectClassAssert$ByteBuddy$zSZUiQrB$auxiliary$7Qx1CRh1.java:-1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nWith the following assertion classes in package\r\n```java\r\npackage org.example.project.assertions;\r\nimport java.util.Objects;\r\nimport org.assertj.core.api.AbstractAssert;\r\nimport org.assertj.core.api.SoftAssertions;\r\n\r\npublic class MyProjectSoftAssertions extends SoftAssertions {\r\n\r\n  public static class MyProjectClass {\r\n    private final Object value;\r\n    public MyProjectClass(Object value) {\r\n      this.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Object getValue() {\r\n      return value;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static class MyProjectClassAssert extends AbstractAssert<MyProjectClassAssert, MyProjectClass> {\r\n\r\n    public MyProjectClassAssert(MyProjectClass actual) {\r\n      super(actual, MyProjectClassAssert.class);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public MyProjectClassAssert hasValue(Object value) {\r\n      if (!Objects.equals(actual.getValue(), value)) {\r\n        failWithMessage(\"Expecting value to be <%s> but was <%s>:\", value, actual.getValue());\r\n      }\r\n      return this;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public MyProjectClassAssert assertThat(MyProjectClass actual) {\r\n    return proxy(MyProjectClassAssert.class, MyProjectClass.class, actual);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following test code\r\n```java\r\n @Test\r\n  public void assertValue() {\r\n    MyProjectSoftAssertions softly = new MyProjectSoftAssertions();\r\n    softly.assertThat(new MyProjectClass(\"v2\")).hasValue(\"v1\");\r\n    softly.assertAll();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nproduces the following error message:\r\n```\r\norg.assertj.core.api.SoftAssertionError: \r\nThe following assertion failed:\r\n1) Expecting value to be <v1> but was <v2>:\r\nat MyProjectSoftAssertions$MyProjectClassAssert$ByteBuddy$nP0a48xo$auxiliary$OKW4UxOl.call(MyProjectSoftAssertions$MyProjectClassAssert$ByteBuddy$nP0a48xo$auxiliary$OKW4UxOl.java:-1)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
