    1.

We might also push down the priority of opentest4j. \r\nIf we go with the following order:\r\n\r\n1. org.testng.SkipException\r\n2. org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException\r\n3. org.opentest4j.TestAbortedException\r\n\r\nTestNG with JUnit 4 would still work and JsonUnit should also work.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would vote for option 2 as this would make JsonUnit work nicely with both JUnit 4 and 5 use cases. Keen to contribute in case @lukas-krecan agrees.\r\n\r\nOption 3 would be the best but timeline and feasibility can vary from project to project.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/687553012/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3732602760,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzczMjYwMjc2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/3732602760","actor":{"login":"lukas-krecan","id":815787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTc4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan","html_url":"https://github.com/lukas-krecan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-05T05:18:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3732602761,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3MzI2MDI3NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/3732602761","actor":{"login":"lukas-krecan","id":815787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTc4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan","html_url":"https://github.com/lukas-krecan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-05T05:18:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/687555007","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1985#issuecomment-687555007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1985","id":687555007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzU1NTAwNw==","user":{"login":"lukas-krecan","id":815787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTc4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan","html_url":"https://github.com/lukas-krecan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-krecan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public",
