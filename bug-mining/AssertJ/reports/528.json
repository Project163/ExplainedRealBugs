the bug**\r\nThe behaviour of `isEqualTo(String)` when asserting a java.util.Date can fail if you switch the default time zone during a test run.\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.24.2\r\n* java version: 21\r\n* test framework version: JUnit 5\r\n* os (if relevant): \r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nAdd a test case showing the bug that we can run\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Test {\r\n @Test\r\n    void testWithIsEqualTo() {\r\n//      TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"CET\"));\r\n//      assertThat(Date.from(Instant.parse(\"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000+01:00\")))\r\n//          .describedAs(\"Using CET time zone\")\r\n//          .isEqualTo(\"2024-03-01\");\r\n      TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"WET\"));\r\n      assertThat(Date.from(Instant.parse(\"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000+00:00\")))\r\n          .describedAs(\"Using WET time zone\")\r\n          .isEqualTo(\"2024-03-01\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void test() {\r\n//      TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"CET\"));\r\n//      assertThat(Date.from(Instant.parse(\"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000+01:00\")))\r\n//          .describedAs(\"Using CET time zone\")\r\n//          .hasYear(2024)\r\n//          .hasMonth(3)\r\n//          .hasDayOfMonth(1);\r\n      TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"WET\"));\r\n      assertThat(Date.from(Instant.parse(\"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000+00:00\")))\r\n          .describedAs(\"Using WET

The test will be ok.\r\n\r\nNow enable the code in comments and run the test again. The test `testWithIsEqualTo` now fails, but on the part that was already active before.\r\n\r\n(I found the issue with using [@DefaultTimeZone](https://junit-pioneer.org/docs/default-locale-timezone/), but I can reproduce it without it, so I believe it might be an AssertJ issue).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3382/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
