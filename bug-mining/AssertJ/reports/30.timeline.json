As `hasCause()` there is using equals, the other assertion you proposed, hasCauseOfClass() seems necessary too. I feel that in most cases, we don't have access to exact reference of a `Throwable` to make assertions with ?\n\nI will write `hasCauseOfClass()` to play with it and prepare a

question though: do you think that `hasCause(Class<? extends Throwable> eClass)` should support inheritance ?\nFor example, if cause is a `NullPointerException` would `hasCause(RuntimeException.class)` be successful or not ?\n\nI would say it should but it may be confusing ... WDYT ?\n\nWe may avoid the confusion by renaming the assertion to `hasCauseInstanceOf(Class<? extends Throwable> eClass)` and keep `hasCause(Class<? extends Throwable> eClass)` to check the exact runtime type.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/19062797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/19113109","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/19#issuecomment-19113109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/19","id":19113109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTEzMTA5","user":{"login":"jcgay","id":967336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NzMzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/967336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay","html_url":"https://github.com/jcgay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-07T15:13:50Z","updated_at":"2013-06-07T15:13:50Z","body":"I think it should support inheritance.
