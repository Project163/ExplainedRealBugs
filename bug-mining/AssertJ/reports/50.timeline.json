thanks for the contribution.\n\nThere is an area of improvement for the error message, this is why I'm not closing the issue yet, the point is we don't know that we are using a field comparison strategy and what fields are involved or ignored and which fields values differ.\n\nTake this failing assertion example taken from assertj-example: \n\n``` java\nList<Employee> employees = newArrayList(new Employee(\"Bill\", 60, \"Micro$oft\"));\nEmployee appleBill = new Employee(\"Bill\", 60, \"Apple\");\n// FAIL\nassertThat(employees).usingFieldByFieldElementComparator().contains(appleBill);\n```\n\nthe error message is:\n\n```\nExpecting:\n <[Person[name=Bill]]>\nto contain:\n <[Person[name=Bill]]>\nbut could not find:\n <[Person[name=Bill]]>\n```\n\nmmmh ... we don't have much information to understand why it failed.\n\nWe should add some information on the comparison strategy at the end of the error message. \n\nFor usingFieldByFieldElementComparator: \n\n```\nwhen comparing elements field by field (on all field)\n```\n\nFor usingElementComparatorIgnoringFields(\"company\"): \n\n```\nwhen comparing elements field by field except the following fields : company\n```\n\nFor usingElementComparatorOnFields(\"name\", \"company\"):\n\n```\nwhen comparing elements field by field on the following fields only : name, company\n```\n\nTell me if you want/have time to finish this, if you don't, no problem, I'll finish it.\nAnd you're welcome if you find better formulation to express what comparison strategy was used.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/31098180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/31123414","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/116#issuecomment-31123414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/116","id":31123414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTIzNDE0","user":{"login":"kretes","id":1224887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQ4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1224887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes","html_url":"https://github.com/kretes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kretes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-23T15:05:53Z","updated_at":"2013-12-23T15:05:53Z","body":"Yes,
