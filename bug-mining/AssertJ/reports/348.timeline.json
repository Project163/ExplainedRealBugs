The only solution then is to represent everything unambiguously all the time in the default representation even when the displayed objects have clearly different representations.\r\n\r\nMy first thoughts is that it might be a bit too much noise in the error messages if every single value is represented in its unambiguous form.\r\n\r\nMaybe an intermediate solution would be to provide a `UnambiguousStandardRepresentation` which basically would use the standard representation and add the type + identify values. The code is 99% there since `StandardRepresentation` already has [unambiguousToStringOf](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/blob/b82b86b2c54bb33c09103744ea0d7af4b37b4dee/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/presentation/StandardRepresentation.java#L200).\r\n\r\nSince AssertJ allows to [specify a representation](https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-representation) globally, once you have written your own `UnambiguousStandardRepresentation` you can easily use it everywhere.\r\n\r\nThinking out loud, this could be something AssertJ out of the box in its [`Configuration`](https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-configuration), something like:\r\n```\r\nconfiguration.useUnambiguousStandardRepresentation();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW that's not the `contains` assertion I'm pretty sure it's `containsExactly`
