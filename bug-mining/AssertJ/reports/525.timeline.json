\r\nAfter conducting an initial investigation, I have identified a concern regarding this idea. From a Java perspective, it is impossible to create a sealed class without any permitted subclasses. This limitation could render the proposed assertion method hasNoPermittedSubclasses() useless.\r\nHowever, it's noteworthy that both the class file specification and the Javadoc for Class::getPermittedSubclasses suggest that such a scenario is possible.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I would like to seek your input on the following questions:\r\n- Should we proceed with adding this assertion despite the aforementioned Java constraint?\r\n- If the decision is affirmative, be advised that crafting a test for this scenario may involve unconventional methods to load a sealed class without any permitted subclasses (potentially by adding a prepared class file to the repository and loading it using a custom class loader).
