When elements in `actual` collection are in \"wrong\" order, then `containsOnly` fails, which is incorrect.\n\nTalk is cheap, so I wrote some code demonstrating this issue. A `Person` class consists of three fields: `first`, `last` and `info`, but the `equals` and `hashCode` are calculated just on fields `first` and `last`.  Test should pass, but it unexpectedly fails.\n\nI'm using assertj-core:3.0.0 with Java 8.\n\n``` java\nimport org.assertj.core.internal.FieldByFieldComparator;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.Objects;\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\n\npublic class ClassWithEqualsAndHashCodeContainsOnlyTest {\n    @Test\n    public void invertedOrderArray() {\n        Person a = new Person(\"Obi-Wan\", \"Kenobi\", \"good man\");\n        Person b = new Person(\"Obi-Wan\", \"Kenobi\", \"bad man\");\n\n        assertThat(new Person[]{a, b})\n                .usingElementComparator(new FieldByFieldComparator())\n                // inverted order\n                .containsOnly(b, a);\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void invertedOrderList() {\n        Person a = new Person(\"Obi-Wan\", \"Kenobi\", \"good man\");\n        Person b = new Person(\"Obi-Wan\", \"Kenobi\", \"bad man\");\n\n        assertThat(Arrays.asList(a, b))\n                .usingElementComparator(new FieldByFieldComparator())\n                // inverted order\n                .containsOnly(b, a);\n    }\n\n    private class Person {\n        private String first, last, info;\n\n        public Person(String first, String last, String info) {\n            this.first = first;\n            this.last = last;\n            this.info = info;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public boolean equals(Object o) {\n            if (this == o) return true;\n            if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n            Person person = (Person) o;\n            return Objects.equals(first, person.first) && Objects.equals(last, person.last);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public int hashCode() {\n            return Objects.hash(first, last);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public String toString() {\n            return String.format(\"Person{first='%s', last='%s', info='%s'}\",\n                first, last, info);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/432/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
