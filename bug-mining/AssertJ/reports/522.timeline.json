Feature summary\r\nIt would be nice if there was a method in MapAssert that returns a (Abstract)CollectionAssert over the values contained in the map.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```java\r\nAssertions.assertThat(Map.of(\"str\", 1))\r\n\t.values()\r\n\t.contains(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently I have to use the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nAssertions.assertThat(Map.of(\"str\", 1))\r\n\t.extracting(Map::values, as(collection(Integer.class)))\r\n\t.contains(1);\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14496712849,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAIX3Vs55MFWXzwAAAANgEkiR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14496712849","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-02T23:51:44Z","label":{"name":"type:
