### Summary\r\n\r\nThe ability to group together tests using `satisfies()` is very useful and better than the `returns()` fluent expression in most cases. It can shorten some use cases quite significantly. However, I didn't find it immediately, and I think the name is not great when not sharing a condition. Could I suggest an alternative top-level entry point, `assertWith(Object, Consumer)` that would make this more obvious?\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(team.getPlayers().get(0).getStats()).satisfies(t-> {\r\n   assertThat(t.pointPerGame).isGreaterThan(25.7);\r\n   assertThat(t.assistsPerGame).isGreaterThan(7.2);\r\n   assertThat(t.reboundsPerGame).isBetween(9, 12);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nProposed:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertWith(team.getPlayers().get(0).getStats(), t-> {\r\n   assertThat(t.pointPerGame).isGreaterThan(25.7);\r\n   assertThat(t.assistsPerGame).isGreaterThan(7.2);\r\n   assertThat(t.reboundsPerGame).isBetween(9, 12);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I'd also be happy with `with`, `using` or `assertUsing`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1535/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
