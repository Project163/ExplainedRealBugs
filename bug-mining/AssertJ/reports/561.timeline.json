Check List:\r\n* Fixes #3354\r\n* Unit tests : YES\r\n* Javadoc with a code example (on API only) : NA\r\n* PR meets the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md): YES\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📝 Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request resolves an issue where the recursive comparison did not throw an exception when checking for a non-existent field within various container or wrapper types.\r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\n\r\nWhen using `usingRecursiveComparison().comparingOnlyFields()`, specifying a path to a field that does not exist inside a container (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Array`, `Optional`, `AtomicReference`) would silently pass instead of throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`.\r\n\r\nFor example, given a `Player` class with only a `name` field, the following assertion would incorrectly pass:\r\n```java\r\n// This test would pass, which is wrong.\r\nassertThat(teamWithPlayers)\r\n  .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n  .comparingOnlyFields(\"players.salary\") // 'salary' does not exist on Player\r\n  .isEqualTo(anotherTeam);\r\n```\r\nThis was caused by the `checkComparedFieldExists` method in `RecursiveComparisonConfiguration`, which stopped its validation path as soon as it encountered a container, without inspecting the elements within it.\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the `checkComparedFieldExists` method to correctly validate field paths that traverse through containers.\r\n\r\n1.  **Refactored `checkComparedFieldExists` in `RecursiveComparisonConfiguration.java`**:\r\n    - The `while` loop logic was restructured using an `if-else` block to clearly distinguish between container and non-container nodes.\r\n    - When a container node is detected via `isContainer()`, it no longer halts the check.\r\n\r\n2.  **Added `unwrapContainer` Helper Method**:\r\n    - A new private helper method, `unwrapContainer`, has been introduced to handle the logic of extracting a sample element from various container types.\r\n    - It currently supports `Optional`, `AtomicReference`, `Iterable`, and `Array`.\r\n    - This separation of concerns improves the readability and maintainability of the main validation method.\r\n\r\nThe new logic ensures that the validation continues by \"unwrapping\" the container, taking the first element as a sample, and then proceeding to check for the existence of the subsequent field in the path on that element. This results in the expected `IllegalArgumentException` being thrown upfront.\r\n\r\n## ✅ Testing\r\n\r\nA new test class, `RecursiveComparison_NonExistentField_Test.java`, has been added to verify the fix.\r\n\r\n-   The test class includes nested tests for `Iterable` (List/Set), `Array`, `Optional`, and `AtomicReference` to ensure broad coverage.\r\n-   Each test confirms that an `IllegalArgumentException` is now correctly thrown when a non-existent field within these containers is specified for comparison.\r\n-   The tests adhere to the project's contribution guidelines, including `package-private` visibility and underscore-based naming conventions.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, all new tests pass, confirming the bug is resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3857/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/2975290296","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3354#issuecomment-2975290296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3354","id":2975290296,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs6xV1O4","user":{"login":"chadongmin","id":40655807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU1ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40655807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin","html_url":"https://github.com/chadongmin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadongmin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-16T06:42:55Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T06:15:37Z","body":"@joel-costigliola \n\nI've created a pull request to address this issue: https://github.com/assertj/assertj/pull/3857\n\nThe proposed solution refactors the validation logic to correctly unwrap various container types and ensures that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown as expected.
