Should we have the same overloading, for consistency? \r\nOr should we wait for the decision in [#2357](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2357)?\r\n\r\nHere would be an alternative - maybe it can be an option: Provide a way to convert `ThrowingConsumer<T>` to `Condition<T>`:\r\n```java\r\nstatic <T> Condition<T> sneaky(ThrowingConsumer<T> test) {\r\n  return new Condition<>(\r\n    actual -> {\r\n      try {\r\n        test.accept(actual);\r\n        return true;\r\n      } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        return false;\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"some description...\"\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis will help us deal with throwing functions/consumers like this:\r\n```java\r\n// java\r\nassertThat(Optional.of(1))\r\n  .hasValueSatisfying(JavaFile::func)\r\n  .hasValueSatisfying(sneaky(JavaFile::funcThrowing));\r\n```\r\nAlso, if we expose this helper that converts from `ThrowingConsumer` to a `Condition` (rather than converting to a palin java Cosnumer) - we'll be using the overloaded method that requires a `Condition`, so there should be no ambiguity for Kotlin either:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n// kotlin\r\nassertThat(1)\r\n  .satisfies(JavaFile::func)\r\n  .satisfies(sneaky(JavaFile::funcThrowing)) // <-- will help here as well\r\n\r\nassertThat(Optional.of(1))\r\n  .hasValueSatisfying(JavaFile::func)\r\n  .hasValueSatisfying(sneaky(JavaFile::funcThrowing)) \r\n```","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/2195000154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"etrandafir93","id":75391049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxMDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75391049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93","html_url":"https://github.com/etrandafir93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13319281964,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs6GR1eEzwAAAAMZ5B0s","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/13319281964","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-27T15:18:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13319281977,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs6GR1eEzwAAAAMZ5B05","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/13319281977","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-27T15:18:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13319282005,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs6GR1eEzwAAAAMZ5B1V","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/13319282005","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commi
