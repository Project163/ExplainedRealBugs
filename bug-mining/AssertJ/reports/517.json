Feature summary\r\nAt this moment I do not think AssertJ supports non-accessible classes and fields with Java 17+. Would it be useful to have a default `RecursiveComparisonConfiguration` that ignores all non exported packages, and non-accessible fields?\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ClassUnderTest {\r\n    private final int foo;\r\n\r\n    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();\r\n    \r\n    public ClassUnderTest(int foo) {\r\n        this.foo = foo;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public static ClassUnderTest classUnderTest() {\r\n        return new ClassUnderTest(42);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd the test class as follows, note the configuration for the recursive comparison.\r\n```java\r\nclass ClassUnderTestTest {\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testClassUnderTest() {\r\n        assertThat(ClassUnderTest.classUnderTest())\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison().ignoreNonExportedPackages()\r\n            .isEqualTo(new ClassUnderTest(42));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the above, I'm only interested in the fact that I correctly call the constructor with value 42. Suppose this class is part of a library, then I'm unable to add an equals() and hashcode().\r\nWithout the call to (the proposed method) `.ignoreNonExportedPackages()` the test would fail. Currently, I would have to write `.ignoringFieldsOfTypes(ReentrantReadWriteLock.class)`. In general I would need to ignore much more types and fields, since those would always cause errors in my test. Similar to non exported packages, one could also add a configuration; `.ignoreNonAccessibleFields()`.\r\n\r\nI'm interested to hear your opinion.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
