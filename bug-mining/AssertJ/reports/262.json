Summary\r\nTrying to write assertion on a list of objects where I have a custom assertion for the type of the objects contained within it. I have created a factory instance for the custom assertion class for the type.\r\n\r\nassertThat has a nice overload that takes an iterable and a factory. But the filteredOn iterator ignores the factory and returns an assert instance using just ObjectAssert<ELEMENT> so you lose the type safe support.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nSo assuming TolkeinCharacter and TolkeinCharacterAssert as in the docs:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static AssertFactory<TolkeinCharacter, TolkeinCharacterAssert> FACTORY =\r\n            new AssertFactory<TolkeinCharacter, TolkeinCharacterAssert>()\r\n            {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public TolkeinCharacterAssert createAssert(TolkeinCharacter character)\r\n                {\r\n                    return TolkeinCharacterAssert.assertThat(character);\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows you to do this which will work assuming that frodo is first:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n     assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing, factory)\r\n         .first()\r\n         .hasAge(33);\r\n```\r\nHowever this does not compile:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n     assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing, factory)\r\n         .filteredOn(\"name\", \"Frodo\")\r\n         .first()\r\n         .hasAge(33);\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
