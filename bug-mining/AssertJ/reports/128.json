been getting quite into writing a nice assertj testing DSL (great job on assertj BTW!). Given some ListAssert I want to be able to filter the list by some Condition; then make assertions on the resulting collection. \n\nI realise in a fluent DSL that filtering means you lose the original list unless you use a temporary variable but thats fine. e.g.\n\n```\nassertThat(house).people().filter(male()).hasSize(1);\nassertThat(house).people().filter(female()).hasSize(3);\n\n// or use a temporary\nListAssert<Person> people = assertThat(house).people();\npeople.filter(male()).hasSize(1);\npeople.filter(female()).hasSize(3);\n```\n\neither way being able to filter on a condition then being able to make further assertions on the filtered list seems pretty handy. \n\nUnless I'm just being thick and missed something?\n\nHappy to submit a PR if you like?\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
