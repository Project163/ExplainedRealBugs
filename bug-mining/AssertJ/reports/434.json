Summary\r\n\r\nHad a `containsEntry()` map assertion that failed because the entry was missing.\r\n\r\nIt was unclear from the diagnostic message whether the failure was because there was no entry present, or because there was an entry present for that key with a different value.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\n* If an entry is present with the same key, the failure message should say that it failed because the values were different.\r\n* If no entry is present with the same key, the failure message should say that it failed because no entry was present for that key.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions:\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\n```\r\nExpecting map:\r\n <{\"accept\"=\"application/json\", \"authorization\"=\"bearer eagraahl\" ...}>\r\nto contain:\r\n <[MapEntry[key=\"authorization\", value=\"bearer ezfufztp\"]]>\r\nbut could not find the following map entries:\r\n <[MapEntry[key=\"authorization\", value=\"bearer ezfufztp\"]]>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuggestion 1:\r\n```\r\nExpecting map:\r\n <{\"accept\"=\"application/json\", \"authorization\"=\"bearer eagraahl\" ...}>\r\nto contain entry:\r\n <[MapEntry[key=\"authorization\", value=\"bearer ezfufztp\"]]>\r\nbut key had different
