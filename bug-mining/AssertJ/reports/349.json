 Summary\r\nI am really digging the ability to ignore null fields in the _actual_ based on null fields of the _expected_ since it provides a very flexible way to build highly reusable tests in our BDD framework. It would be really nice if this functionality was extended to include Optional.empty() as well.\r\nHope it could land as another part of the #1002.\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    String nickName;\r\n    Integer tailCount;\r\n\r\n    Animal(String nickName, Integer tailCount) {\r\n        this.nickName = nickName;\r\n        this.tailCount = tailCount;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n    Optional<Integer> getTailCount() {\r\n        Optional.ofNullable(tailCount);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Optional<String > getNickname() {\r\n        Optional.ofNullable(tailCount);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd such assertion would pass:\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(new Animal(\"Fluffers\", 9) \r\n    .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n    .ignoringActualNullFields()\r\n    .isEqualTo(\"Fluffers\", null) ;\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
