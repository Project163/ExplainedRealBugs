Joel,\n\nIt seems like a complicated refactoring to me.\nIf it must be done, we should try to define what defines an assertion error message.\nCan it be considered like something with, at most, 4 parts which meets most of our needs :\n1. Expecting\n2. To be / have / end with / ... \n3. But found / was / had ...\n4. And not expecting ...\n\nWhat should be done for assertion error messages which don't fit this model :\n1. Change it to fit this model (if possible) ?\n2. Add custom methods to handle these cases ?\n- Sub-questions : Allow string formats to customize easily messages ? Doesn't this mean less uniformity ?\n\nSome examples of this :\n- ShouldBeWithin :\n  `super(\"%nExpecting:%n <%s>%nto be on %s <%s>\", actual, fieldDescription, fieldValue);`\n- ShouldContainExactly :\n  `super(\"%n\" +\n        \"Actual and expected have the same elements but not in the same order, at index %s actual element was:%n\" +\n        \"  <%s>%n\" + \n        \"whereas expected element was:%n\" +\n        \"  <%s>%n%s\",\n        indexOfDifferentElements, actualElement, expectedElement, comparisonStrategy);`\n- ShouldNotContainAtIndex :\n  `super(\"%nExpecting:%n <%s>%nnot to contain:%n <%s>%nat index <%s>%n%s\", actual, expected, index.value, comparisonStrategy);`\n\nWe could have BasicErrorMessageFactory taking an AssertionErrorMessageBuilder in its constructor instead of a formatted String with arguments. Its create() methods would call the toString method of the builder :\n![assertionerrormessagebuilder](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4090574/6996652/4dde67c0-db94-11e4-8834-600db13bfdd0.png)\n\nAlso, what about unit tests and their maintenance ?\nThe assertion error messages and their formatting is tested so every change to the formatting will mean that many tests must be fixed. If we go for uniformity many more tests will be broken after a reformatting of error messages. \n\nOther ideas are welcome :)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/89753625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"abalhier","id":4090574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4090574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier","html_url":"https://github.com/abalhier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abalhier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/98590384","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3#issuecomment-98590384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3","id":98590384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4NTkwMzg0","user":{"login":"dorzey","id":61307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey","html_url":"https://github.com/dorzey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-04T05:24:36Z","updated_at":"2015-05-04T05:24:36Z","body":"@abalhier, did you start working on this? This is something that I'd be interested in helping out with.\n\nAs @abalhier suggested we need to be clear on where we want to end up. But I think it would be useful to state what we believe is wrong with the current (MessageFormatter/ErrorMessageFactory) implementation.\n\nI'm not sure the Spock style suggested by @mariuszs would work for assertj. Spock allows only a single assertion per line, whereas assertj's fluent style means you could have:\n\n``` java\nassertThat(stack).hasSize(2).contains(1, 2);\n```\n\nA Spock style message would make it more difficult to see which criteria had not been met\n\nLastly, assuming this gets rolled out iteratively, where is the best place to
