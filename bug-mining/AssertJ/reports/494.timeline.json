the bug**\r\nCompile error in Eclipse 2023-12: The method assertThatThrownBy(ThrowableAssert.ThrowingCallable) is ambiguous for the type AmbigiousCallTest.\r\n\r\nThe only change is the upgrade from 3.24.2 to 3.25. In 3.24.2 the same code was fine.\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.25\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\nDon't *run* the below code, but just *compile* it. At least ECJ doesn't like it.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class AmbigiousCallTest {\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void ambigiousCall() throws Exception {\r\n        assertThatThrownBy(AmbigiousCallTest::verify)\r\n                .hasMessageContaining(\"No objects are given\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void verify(final Object... objects) {\r\n        // foo\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProbably related to #3043. Workaround: Extract the method reference to a local variable. The type information of that local variable is sufficient to choose one of the two methods.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3314/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3314/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-02T21:45:52Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T21:45:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3318","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3318/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3318/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3318/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/pull/3318","id":2062976294,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAIX3Vs5jFPbE","number":3318,"title":"Revert
