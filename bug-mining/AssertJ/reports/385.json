Summary\r\n\r\n#1983 causes assumptions to fail instead of ignoring the test in edge cases.\r\n\r\nThis only occurs with JUnit4 when opentest4j is in the classpath, e.g. as transitive dependency from other test utilities like [Json-Unit](https://github.com/lukas-krecan/JsonUnit).\r\n\r\nJUnit4 does not recognize `org.opentest4j.TestAbortedException` as expected and fails.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nI created a [test case for Json-Unit](https://github.com/JoergSiebahn/JsonUnit/commit/f0d62310a1864095747d49d8b321d421c8ca7154).\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage net.javacrumbs.jsonunit.test.junit4;\r\n\r\nimport org.assertj.core.api.Assumptions;\r\nimport org.junit.Test;\r\n\r\npublic class AssumptionsWithAssertJTest {\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void shouldBeIgnoredButFails() {\r\n        Assumptions.assumeThat(\"Test\").isEqualTo(\"NotEqualToTest\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also
