Summary\r\nI think this methods can be very useful for `PathAssert`, `FileAssert` and `InputStreamAssert`:\r\n* `hasDigest(MessageDigest digest, byte[] expected)`\r\n* `hasDigest(MessageDigest digest, String expected)`\r\n* `hasDigest(String algorithm, byte[] expected)`\r\n* `hasDigest(String algorithm, String expected)`\r\n* `hasDigest(String algorithm, String provider, byte[] expected)`\r\n* `hasDigest(String algorithm, String provider, String expected)`\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nURL source = new URL(\"https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/assertj/assertj-core/2.9.0/assertj-core-2.9.0.jar\");\r\nassertThat(source.openStream()).hasDigest(\"SHA1\", \"5c5ae45b58f12023817abe492447cdc7912c1a2c\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI can create PR if you approve such
