is in line with `catchThrowable` and returning `null` is currently the expected behavior for both, as mentioned in the Javadoc.\r\n\r\nI understand your point, however, I am not sure if we should enforce the presence of an exception with `catchThrowableOfType` because the `catchThrowable` methods are mainly meant to be used in [BDD style](https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-exception-assertions-bdd-style) tests.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to enforce the existence of a specific exception type, [`assertThatExceptionOfType`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.assertj/assertj-core/latest/org/assertj/core/api/Assertions.html#assertThatExceptionOfType(java.lang.Class)) might be a better candidate.\r\n\r\nFollowing your example, this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Test\r\n  void testNoException() {\r\n    assertThatExceptionOfType(IllegalArgumentException.class)\r\n        .isThrownBy(() ->

: I totally understand the point, yet, a few lines below where you linked in the documentation but in the same section, you can see this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1061229/180292679-8722dbf8-3e41-40c1-9a41-d55d380f9b4c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this has the exact same issue that `assertThat(textException).hasMessageContaining(\"boom\");` has: it will throw a NPE.\r\n\r\nSo, perhaps the example in the doc is also a little bit misleading?\r\n\r\nAlso, one of the issues that only `catchThrowableOfType` addresses is that it gives you an Exception of the right type, while no other method that I could find does (they usually return a `ThrowableTypeAssert` instead, or a raw `Throwable`).\r\n\r\nMay I ask if there is a better way to:\r\n\r\n1. check that an exception of a specific type is thrown (covered by your solution)\r\n2. checking that an uncommon field is part of that exception and set to the right value (assert doesn't understand the other fields)\r\n\r\nWhat `catchThrowableOfType` allows (albeit with the NPE issue):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Test\r\n  void testNoException() {\r\n    final MyException e = catchThrowableOfType(() -> System.out.println(\"hello\"), MyException.class);\r\n\r\n    assertThat(e).isNotNull(); // workaround\r\n    OtherClass value = e.getOtherValue();\r\n    assertThat(e.getField1()).isEqualTo(\"inside value\");\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat your solution allows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Test\r\n  void testNoException() {\r\n    assertThatExceptionOfType(MyException.class).isThrownBy(() -> System.out.println(\"hello\"));\r\n    final MyException e = ?; // how do I get the exception from there?\r\n\r\n    OtherClass value = e.getOtherValue();\r\n    assertThat(e.getField1()).isEqualTo(\"inside value\");\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAm I missing something? Maybe I'm just finding this particular case not so clean, but I really might have missed an obvious way to do that cleanly.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1191836093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Jiehong","id":1061229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjEyMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1061229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiehong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiehong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7040798445,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs5NxUwWzwAAAAGjqg7t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/7040798445","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T19:06:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7040798451,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs5NxUwWzwAAAAGjqg7z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/7040798451","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T19:06:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1192432479","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2706#issuecomment-1192432479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2706","id":1192432479,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5HExNf","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-22T10:34:38Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T10:38:08Z
