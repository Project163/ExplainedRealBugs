Summary\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it's possible to check file sizes using the file assertions (see #1311), but it's not possible to check if a file is bigger or smaller than a certain size. I'd propose to add these assertions too, and match the signature with the collection assertions, like this.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(file).hasSizeBetween(1_000_000, 2_000_000));\r\nassertThat(file).hasGreaterThan(1_000_000));\r\nassertThat(file).hasLessThanOrEqual(2_000_000));\r\n// etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm willing to do a PR for this, but I'd like to know first if this is something which would be welcome in AssertJ, or not.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
