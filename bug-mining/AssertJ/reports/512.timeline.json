https://github.com/assertj/assertj/pull/3340 but it's hard to give other specific examples right now. This came about because as an experiment to see if people in our org were writing code relying on undocumented `equals`/`hashCode` behaviour of certain core classes, we changed the implementations to simply throw exceptions to see what tests failed. Many of the exceptions we saw were coming from `assertj` itself. The reason it's so difficult to say whether these are bugs or not is that it would not be a bug in itself for `assertj` to be calling `equals`/`hashCode` on the arguments passed. I'd have to go through the exceptions and find if `equals`/`hashCode` was being used correctly. In this particular case I was able to see quite quickly that it was a bug, but other exceptions require more analysis. I'll create more issues if I do find any more.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1903709805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PBoddington","id":20281547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjgxNTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20281547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington","html_url":"https://github.com/PBoddington","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBoddington/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1903970471","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3339#issuecomment-1903970471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3339","id":1903970471,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5xfEin","user":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-22T13:06:51Z","updated_at":"2024-01-22T13:06:51Z","body":"Thanks, Paul!\r\n\r\n@joel-costigliola is already looking at #3340.
