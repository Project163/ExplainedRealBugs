It looks like this:\n\n``` java\nimport org.assertj.core.api.SoftAssertions;\n\npublic class TolkienSoftAssertions extends SoftAssertions {\n\n        public TolkienCharacterAssert assertThat(TolkienCharacter actual) {\n                return proxy(TolkienCharacterAssert.class, TolkienCharacter.class, actual);\n        }\n}\n```\n\nThen I created a simple class to test my `SoftAssertions`:\n\n``` java\npublic class Demo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        TolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter();\n        TolkienCharacter samnullGamgee = null;\n        TolkienSoftAssertions softly = new TolkienSoftAssertions();\n        softly.assertThat(frodo).hasAge(10); // Expect failure - age will be 0 due to not being initialized.\n        softly.assertThat(samnullGamgee).hasAge(11); // Expect failure - argument is null.\n        softly.assertAll();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen I run this class, I get a `NullPointerException` when asserting on `samnullGamgee`.  It occurs in the `if`-statement in the `hasAge` method, which I've included below for convenience:\n\n``` java\npublic TolkienCharacterAssert hasAge(int age) {\n    // check that actual TolkienCharacter we want to make assertions on is not null.\n    isNotNull();\n\n    // check condition\n    if (actual.getAge() != age) {\n        failWithMessage(\"Expected character's age to be <%s> but was <%s>\", age, actual.getAge());\n    }\n\n    // return the current assertion for method chaining\n    return this;\n}\n```\n##### Workaround\n\nI found two ways to work around this problem.\n\nA. Update the line containing the `if`-statement to\n\n```\n    if (actual != null & actual.getAge() != age)\n```\n\nI'm not a huge fan of this approach.  It seems to defeat the purpose of the call to `isNotNull()`, and it makes the code a bit less readable.\n\nB. Replace the line containing `isNotNull()` with\n\n```\n    Objects.instance().assertNotNull(info, actual)\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the `Objects` class is in the package `org.assertj.core.internal`, which makes me leery of using it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
