Summary\r\nSometimes we extend AtomicReference in our classes to store some internal data. (Of course, usually it's better to use delegation instead of inheritance, but it may increase memory footprint and it may be undesirable in some cases.) `StandardRepresentation.toStringOf` returns special representation for instances of such classes, which doesn't include result of 'toString' call.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nConsider the following class\r\n```java\r\nclass MyData extends AtomicReference<String> {\r\n  private String description;\r\n\r\n  MyData(String description) {\r\n    this.description = description;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public String toString() {\r\n    return \"MyData[\" + description + \"]\";\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you use its instances in assertions like \r\n```java\r\n    assertThat(new MyData[] {new MyData(\"foo\")}).contains(new MyData(\"bar\"));\r\n```\r\nyou'll get error messages like\r\n> Expecting MyData[]:\r\n  [AtomicReference[null]]\r\nto contain:\r\n  [AtomicReference[null]]\r\nbut could not find the following mydata(s):\r\n  [AtomicReference[null]]\r\n\r\nwhich aren't helpful.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
