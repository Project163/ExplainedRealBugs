concur with @bjhargrave.\r\n\r\nI think it makes good sense to do the `null` check as part of `extracting()` as you won't be able to extract anything useful if `actual` is `null` (I remember having the fleeting thought that this feature should be added but wasn't able to sustain the thought long enough to make an issue report or PR about it! :smile:). As BJ said we are working around this in [osgi-test](https://github.com/osgi/osgi-test) by doing it manually, but it would some boilerplate for us (and for all users) if we didn't have to work around it.\r\n\r\nWhile strictly speaking this is not a backward-compatible change, I think practically speaking it won't cause any compatibility issues because there aren't really any legitimate use cases for calling `extracting()` when you know that `actual` is `null`. Most code out there will either never test cases where `actual` might be `null`, or else will be (should be?) doing their own defensive checks like we are doing.

perspective.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/965839366/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kriegfrj","id":7224087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7224087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegfrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5600605961,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs4-ibEozwAAAAFN0ncJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5600605961","actor":{"login":"bjhargrave","id":277682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzY4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave","html_url":"https://github.com/bjhargrave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-10T23:34:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5600605966,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs4-ibEozwAAAAFN0ncO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5600605966","actor":{"login":"bjhargrave","id":277682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzY4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave","html_url":"https://github.com/bjhargrave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-10T23:34:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"trangntt-016","id":60552188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTUyMTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60552188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016","html_url":"https://github.com/trangntt-016","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trangntt-016/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-13T08:22:25Z","updated_at":"2021-11-13T08:22:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2407","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2407/labels{/name

started introducing `isNotNull` checks in some navigation methods (#2401, #2411, #2412) but this created a side effect for soft assertions.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// GIVEN\r\nSoftAssertions softly = new SoftAssertions();\r\n// WHEN\r\nsoftly.assertThat(null)\r\n      .extracting(Object::getClass) // inner isNotNull() throws AssertionError \r\n      .isEqualTo(...);\r\n// THEN\r\nthen(softly.errorsCollected()).hasSize(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nfails at `extracting` with an NPE, as the `AssertionError` thrown by `isNotNull` is swallowed by the soft assertions' error collector, and the rest of the `extracting` method is executed.\r\n\r\nA similar issue happens with `AbstractOptionalAssert::get` (reported also in #2784), which executes an `isPresent` check internally.\r\n\r\nWe need to rethink what to expect in these cases. Ideally:\r\n* `extracting` / `get` should be completed and one `AssertionError` due to `isNotNull` / `isPresent` should be collected without further failures\r\n* Any other chained assertions should be skipped without collecting additional errors\r\n\r\nThis might require some refactoring in the ByteBuddy configuration and in the `ErrorCollector`
