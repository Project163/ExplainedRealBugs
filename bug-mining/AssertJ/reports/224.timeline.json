Summary\r\nI have noticed two common mistakes people make when using Assertj. Both these mistakes can be caught using static analysis, but it wouldn't hurt if the library caught them at runtime.\r\n\r\nThe first mistake is to call `.equals` instead of `.isEqualTo`. The second mistake is to write code such as `assertThat(some boolean expression)` and forgetting the `isTrue()` call.\r\n\r\nIn AbstractAssert, the code could maintain a boolean flag checking if the object has been \"consumed\" by one of the `isFoo` methods. In the destructor, the code could check the flag and throw an exception.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/979/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
