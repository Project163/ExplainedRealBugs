Summary\r\n\r\nI am working on a [project that will migrate JUnit 5 style assertions to AssertJ's assertion library.](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/issues/8) \r\n\r\nOne issue I have run into is that JUnit 5 has a variant of their assertion methods that accept a Supplier<String> to lazily instantiate the message: \r\n\r\n```\r\nassertEquals(\"joe\", \"fred\", () -> \"These names should be the same\");\r\n```\r\nIdeally, I would like to convert this to: \r\n\r\n```\r\nassertThat(\"fred\").as(() -> \"These names should be the same\").isEqualTo(\"joe\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no obvious, generic way to convert the supplier into a Description. We envision many projects using our \"recipe\" to perform this migration and it would be helpful if there was an overloaded `as` method within the core assertJ library. \r\n\r\nRight now, I am using .`withFailMessage` which already has an overload that accepts a supplier but, of course, this will \r\ncompletely override the message.\r\n\r\nI think it would be as easy as adding something like the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\tpublic SELF as(final Supplier<String> messageSupplier) {\r\n\t\tsuper.as(\r\n\t\t\tnew Description() {\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t@Override\r\n\t\t\tpublic String value() {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn messageSupplier.get();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2061/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2061/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
