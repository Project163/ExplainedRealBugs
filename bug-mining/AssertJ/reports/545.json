the bug**\nWhen using usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator with a custom RecursiveComparisonConfiguration, it is possible that the Representation is null, which leads to a NullPointerException instead of a failed assertion.\n\n* assertj core version: 3.27.0\n* java version: 17\n* test framework version: junit-jupiter 5.11.4\n\nNote that it is possible to work around the NPE by setting the default representation, using `recursiveComparisonConfiguration.withRepresentation(CONFIGURATION_PROVIDER.representation())`\n\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\n\n```java\n\t@Test\n\tvoid usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparatorNPE() {\n\t\tList<List<String>> input = List.of(List.of(\"list\", \"one\"));\n\t\tassertThat(input)\n\t\t\t\t.usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator(RecursiveComparisonConfiguration.builder()\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.withIgnoreCollectionOrder(true)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.build())\n\t\t\t\t.containsExactlyInAnyOrder(List.of(\"another\", \"list\"));\n\t}\n```\n\nthis results in a NullPointerException with this message:\n\n`java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation.toStringOf(Object)\" because the return value of \"org.assertj.core.api.recursive.comparison.RecursiveComparisonConfiguration.getRepresentation()\" is null`","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3719/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
