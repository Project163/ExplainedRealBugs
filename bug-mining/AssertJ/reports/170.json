was writing a unit test for some string joiner logic and came across this. If you try to test the same string present in multiple places in one sequence, the order checker logic is fooled.\n\nSimple example:\n\n```\nfinal String delimiter = \"-\";\nfinal String actual = \"a,b,c\";\nassertThat(actual).containsSequence(\"a\", delimiter, \"b\", delimiter, \"c\");\n```\n\nThis will throw the following:\n\n> java.lang.AssertionError: \n> Expecting:\n>   <\"a-b-c\">\n> to contain the following CharSequences in this order:\n>   <[\"a\", \"-\", \"b\", \"-\", \"c\"]>\n> but <\"-\"> was found before <\"b\">\n\nThe problem is in `org.assertj.core.internal.Strings#assertContainsSequence`\n\n```\n      for (int i = 1; i < values.length; i++) {\n        if (strActual.indexOf(values[i - 1].toString()) > strActual.indexOf(values[i].toString())) {\n          throw failures.failure(info, shouldContainSequence(actual, values, i - 1, comparisonStrategy));\n        }\n      }\n```\n\nWhere checking the second \"-\" results in the `indexOf(\"b\")` returning 2 and `indexOf(\"-\")` returning 1.\n\nThis is ultimately pretty minor, as it can be easily worked around for joiner-based logic with an exact `isEqualTo` assertion instead of the sequence assertion. However, it does seem like a deviation from the documented description for `containsSequence`, which makes no mention of duplicate strings in the values.\n\nAnyways, love the project, great work! I hope to have some free time this week and maybe I'll come up with a patch.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
