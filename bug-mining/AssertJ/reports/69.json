fest-assert 1.x there was a smart way to check instances of array elements e.g.\n\n``` java\nObject[] items = new Object[] {\"hallo\", \"good bye\", new Date()};\nassertThat(items). hasAtLeastOneElementOfType(Date.class);\n```\n\nWhile we migrate from fest-assert to assertj-core 1.6.0 we replaced it by using our own custom 'TypeOf'-condition like\n\n``` java\nassertThat(items).are(Conditions .typeOf(Date,class))\n```\n\nIs it possible to reintegrate this two methods into AbstractObjectArrayAssert?\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
