Summary\r\n\r\n`isFinite()` and `isInfinite()` assertions were handily added via #2005. In the comments on PR #2006, it looks like the original author believed `isNotFinite()` and `isNotInfinite()` were unnecessary, perhaps because they appear to be opposites.\r\n\r\nHowever, `Double.isFinite()` and `Double.isInfinite()` (and corresponding `Float` methods) aren't exact opposites. `isFinite()` means:\r\n* Not `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, _and_\r\n* Not `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, _and_\r\n* Not `NaN`\r\n\r\n`isInfinite()` means:\r\n* `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, _or_\r\n* `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`\r\n\r\nWhile it's possible to achieve the same result as `isNotInfinite()` with `isNotEqualTo(Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY).isNotEqualTo(Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY)`, that's a little cumbersome. \r\n\r\n`isNotFinite()` is much trickier to achieve--the best I've been able to do is `satisfiesAnyOf(...)`, but that's very cumbersome, indeed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
