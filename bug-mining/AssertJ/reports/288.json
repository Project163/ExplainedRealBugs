Summary\r\nWhen asserting that an optional of `String` type has value a normal AssertionError is thrown. However, it is possible to use JUnit 4 or JUnit Jupiter specific assertion error in order to benefit from the IDEs features\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThatT(Optional.of(\"Test\"))\r\n            .hasValue(\"Testing\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting:\r\n <\"Optional[Test]\">\r\nto contain:\r\n <\"Testing\">\r\nbut did not.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting:\r\n <\"Optional[Test]\">\r\nto contain:\r\n <\"Testing\">\r\nbut did not.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that the message can be exactly the same, but if we throw `AssertionFailedError` or `ComparisonFailedError` then the IDE will be able to show the nice diff. Keep in mind that for the `AssertionFailedError` we should make the actual be the value of the Optional.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis might be related to #1296\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
