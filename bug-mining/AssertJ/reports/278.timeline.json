Given that `isSingletonWhoseElementSatisfies` is in use, it makes sense to deprecate it and remove it in a few releases time.\r\n\r\nYou raise the question of keeping the function under a different name.  Currently this would be achieved by:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void usingHaveExactly() {\r\n        Condition<Jedi> isYoda = new Condition<>(\r\n                jedi -> jedi.getName().equals(\"Yoda\") && jedi.lightSaberColor.equals(\"red\"),\r\n                \"Is Yoda\");\r\n\r\n        assertThat(jedis).hasSize(1).haveExactly(1, isYoda);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI actually think that this is a better check in that it will give you feedback on which condition failed.

The `Consumer` argument (which `hasOnlyOneElementSatisfying` uses) is far more readable than the `Condition` argument `haveExactly` uses.\r\n\r\nI know it's a big change, but I would be in favor of deprecating *both* `hasOnlyOneElementSatisfying` and `haveExactly` in favor of either: `numberOfElementsSatisfying` or (`hasNoElementsSatisfying`, `hasOnlyOneElementSatisfying`, ...).  *Mentioned

Here's my question:  Does what you've suggested replace the role of the `Condition` class entirely?\r\n\r\nI like the `filteredOn` approach better as it sticks with framework assertions (assertThat) rather than reverting to standard Java operations.

quite replace them entirely, you can combine Conditions to create another Condition (see http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-conditions.html). Conditions are an extension mechanism that let you express the domain you are working on (e.g. `isJedi` if you are working on a start wars software).\r\n\r\n`Condition` already existed in Fest Assert which is the project AssertJ comes from, there is no plan to remove them at the moment.
