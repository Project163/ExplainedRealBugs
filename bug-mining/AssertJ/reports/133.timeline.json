Dates.newTimestampDateFormat().format(timestamp);\n```\n\nhaving said that, we accept timestamp formatted as \n  `2015-05-08 11:30:00.56` \nbut it is badly parsed as \n  `2015-05-08 11:30:00.056` \ninstead of \n  `2015-05-08 11:30:00.560`\n\nThinking out loud, we might just add trailing `0` to `timestamp.toString()` might solve the pb.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/100047615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":300209538,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDMwMDIwOTUzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/300209538","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-05-08T12:43:52Z","milestone":{"title":"2.1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dorzey","id":61307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey","html_url":"https://github.com/dorzey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorzey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-12T21:11:15Z","updated_at":"2015-05-12T21:11:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/413","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/413/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/413/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/413/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/pull/413","id":75739955,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzUyNzEwOTI=","number":413,"title":"Fixes
