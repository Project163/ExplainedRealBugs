Feature summary\n\nHello!\n\nIt appears that `ThrowableTypeAssert` has some missing methods that `ThrowableAssert` provides. The main one I have spotted is the lack of support for checking suppressed exceptions.\n\n#### Example\n\nI'd like to be able to say this:\n\n```java\nassertThatExceptionOfType(NestedUrlException.class)\n    .isThrownBy(connection::getInputStream)\n    .withCause(cause)\n    .withSuppressedException(closureException);\n```\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot see that this API exists, so right now I have to do this instead:\n\n```java\nassertThatExceptionOfType(NestedUrlException.class)\n    .isThrownBy(connection::getInputStream)\n    .withCause(cause)\n    .satisfies(ex -> assertThat(ex).hasSuppressedException(closureException));\n```\n\n---\n\nI've done a quick scan for any issues relating to this, and I don't see any that match this description (I have a vague feeling I might have raised something related to this in the past but if I did, I cannot find it!).\n\nThanks, again!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/3393686338","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3858#issuecomment-3393686338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3858","id":3393686338,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs7KR4tC","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-11T22:01:38Z","updated_at":"2025-10-11T22:01:38Z","body":"We
