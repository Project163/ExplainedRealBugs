@scordio, @joel-costigliola,\n\nI took a quick look over this one. The issue seems to be in [Introspection::getPropertyGetter](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/4c2d0b1b9dfb6b00c76f55fd155a0a2c844285bc/assertj-core/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/util/introspection/Introspection.java#L72) where we catch all exceptions and wrap them within a _IntrospectionError_ which is later treated as if the field is not present.\n\nIf the getters throw an exception, this will be wrapped within an InvocationTargetException_. So, what we can do is check the exception - if needed - rethrow it without wrapping it in our [IntrospectionError](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/4c2d0b1b9dfb6b00c76f55fd155a0a2c844285bc/assertj-core/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/util/introspection/IntrospectionError.java#L21)\n\n```java\ntry {\n      getter.setAccessible(true);\n      getter.invoke(target);\n} catch (InvocationTargetException t) {\n      // if getter invocation fails, throw different exception that is not caught by our logic\n      throw new GetterInvocationError(formatErrorMessage(\"Encountered exception when invoking getter for %s in %s\", propertyName,\n                                                         target), t.getCause());\n} catch (Exception t) {\n      // same as it currently works:\n      throw new IntrospectionError(formatErrorMessage(\"Unable to find property %s in %s\", propertyName, target), t);\n}\n```\n\nIf this solution seems reasonable, I can raise a PR so you can take a better look into it :) \nLet me know what you think.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/2439570043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"etrandafir93","id":75391049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxMDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75391049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93","html_url":"https://github.com/etrandafir93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14902321563,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs6SQl2izwAAAAN4P2Gb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14902321563","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-26T12:41:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14902321568,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs6SQl2izwAAAAN4P2Gg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14902321568","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-26T12:41:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14902321570,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs6SQl2izwAAAAN4P2Gi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14902321570","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit

- This will be even simpler than I initially thought. \nWe only need to have a different catch block for `InvocationTargetException` and wrap it into a different runtime ex:\n\n```diff\ntry {\n      getter.setAccessible(true);\n      getter.invoke(target);\n+ } catch (InvocationTargetException t) {\n+       //  if getter invocation fails, throw a different exception that's not caught by our logic\n+       throw new GetterInvocationError(formatErrorMessage(\n+                 \"Encountered exception when invoking getter for %s in %s\", propertyName, target), t.getCause());\n+\n} catch (Exception t) {\n      throw new IntrospectionError(formatErrorMessage(\"Unable to find property %s in %s\", propertyName, target), t);\n}\n```\n\nWith this change, we'll still use the field as a fallback verification - **but only when the getter invocation fails for reflection-related reasons**. _Basically, for all the other exceptions described [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Method.html#invoke(java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.Object...)), apart from InvocationTargetException_\n\n---\n\nOn the other hand, I've noticed tests suggesting the original intended behavior was to bypass **ANY** exception thrown by the getter and verify the field:\n\nFor eg: [FieldsOrPropertiesExtractor_extract_Test::should_fallback_to_field_if_exception_has_been_thrown_on_property_access](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/4c2d0b1b9dfb6b00c76f55fd155a0a2c844285bc/assertj-core/src/test/java/org/assertj/core/groups/FieldsOrPropertiesExtractor_extract_Test.java#L107)\n\nIn other words, if the getter throws an error we'll check for the field. If the field is also missing (the case described in this issue), we'll return the non-existent property assertion error, swallowing the exception.\n\nSo I guess it's a matter of deciding what the correct behavior would be in this case.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/2439938368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"etrandafir93","id":75391049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxMDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75391049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93","html_url":"https://github.com/etrandafir93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14922060388,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs6SQl2izwAAAAN5bJJk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14922060388","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-27T10:09:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14922060393,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs6SQl2izwAAAAN5bJJp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14922060393","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-27T10:09:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/2439956390","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3563#issuecomment-2439956390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3563","id":2439956390,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs6Rbsem","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://ap

maintaining this behavior, not to introduce a breaking change - correct? \n\n_If I understand your comment correctly, it is what you have done, right ?_\nNot yet, but yes - we can go into this direction. Please confirm if I got it right: \n - maintain current behavior \n - if the field is also missing, rethrow the original exception produced by the getter\n\n---\n\n_PS: Another interesting case I found (and maybe a bit unexpected/counterintuitive) is with the package-protected getters which will always be ignored, but seems to be slightly off-topic

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior for _hasFieldOrPropertyWithValue_ / _hasFieldOrProperty_ \r\n- we try to invoke the getter/accessor\r\n- if not present **or if it throws an exception** we verify the field directly \r\n- even if the field is missing, the original exception is swallowed \r\n\r\nAs discussed in #3563, we want to keep using the field verification as a fallback in case the getter invocation fails.\r\nHowever, if the field is missing, we want to rethrow the original exception raised by the getter.\r\n\r\n#### About the PR\r\n\r\n- In the first commit, I've added some tests for the current behavior of the lib\r\n- The 2nd commit updates 2 of the tests to reflect the new desired behavior (failing test)\r\n- In 3rd commit we have the actual code changes\r\n\r\n- In `Objects::assertHasFieldOrProperty` we can decide if we want to throw the original getter exception as a runtime (This would be similar to what happens when something like _.extracting(...)_ throws an exception). Alternatively, we can wrap it within an `AssertionError` with a custom message.\r\n\r\n#### Check List:\r\n* Fixes #3563 \r\n* Unit tests : YES \r\n* Javadoc with a code example (on API only) : NA\r\n* PR meets the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nFollowing the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) will make it easier for us to review and accept your PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/2451862692","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3563#issuecomment-2451862692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3563","id":2451862692,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs6SJHSk","user":{"login":"etrandafir93","id":75391049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxMDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75391049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93","html_url":"https://github.com/etrandafir93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrandafir93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-01T13:20:41Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T13:20:41Z","body":"hello @joel-costigliola,\n\nI have raised a [PR](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/pull/3645) for this.
