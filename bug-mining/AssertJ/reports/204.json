imagine you've some generated assertion classes which are deeply nested like discussed [here](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator/issues/67) so you have some assertions like...\n\n``` java\nassertThat(foo).bar().whatnot().cheese().isNotNull(); \nassertThat(foo).bar().whatnot().beer().isEqualTo(\"Stella\");\nassertThat(foo).bar().whatnot().wine().isEqualTo(\"Shiraz\");\n```\n\nthere's some duplication. Now our IDEs can refactor those expressions to variables...\n\n``` java\nWhatnotAssert whatnot = assertThat(foo).bar().whatnot();\nwhatnot.cheese().isNotNull(); \nwhatnot.beer().isEqualTo(\"Stella\");\nwhatnot.wine().isEqualTo(\"Shiraz\");\n```\n\nbut I wonder if Java 8 lambdas could be used to make an XPath like variable/predicate chain via a single new method on AbstractAssert?\n\n``` java\nassertThat(foo).bar().whatnot().with(whatnot -> {\n  whatnot.cheese().isNotNull(); \n  whatnot.beer().isEqualTo(\"Stella\");\n  whatnot.wine().isEqualTo(\"Shiraz\");\n});\n```\n\nThe nice thing is the type inference to avoid the noise of the actual types of the assert classes; so the code feels cleaner yet is nice and DRY.\n\nNot 100% sure on the name of the function; used `with` could be `assert` or something? Basically it just invokes the lamda with the current assertion object really ;).\n\nThoughts? Happy to submit a PR you think its a good idea \n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
