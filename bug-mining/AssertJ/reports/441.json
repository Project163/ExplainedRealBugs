Summary\r\nBased on https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/issues/2392#issuecomment-961969975 and further comments, the implementation of `extracting(Function, AssertFactory)` and `extracting(String, AssertFactory)` in `AbstractAssert` should be improved to ensure that a preliminary `isNotNull` check is performed.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nThe following assertions:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThatObject(null).extracting(Object::getClass);\r\nassertThatObject(null).extracting(\"class\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting actual not to be null\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of failing with:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat
