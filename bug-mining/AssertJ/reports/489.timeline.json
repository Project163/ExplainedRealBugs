`RecursiveComparisonDifferenceCalculator#compareUnorderedIterables` and it looks like the complexity in the worst case is quadratic.\r\n\r\nI think this could be improved by using a hash map to avoid unnecessary comparisons, but this would require a deep hash implementation that is consistent with the deep equals configuration. (There was a `deepHashCode` method in an earlier version of `RecursiveComparisonDifferenceCalculator`, but it was removed in commit 7406133f.)\r\n\r\nI've tested this with assertj version 3.24.2.\r\n\r\nSome example timed comparisons:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void test_usingRecursiveComparison() {\r\n    List<Integer> range100 = IntStream.range(0, 100).boxed().toList();\r\n    List<Integer> range1000 = IntStream.range(0, 1000).boxed().toList();\r\n    List<Integer> range10000 = IntStream.range(0, 10000).boxed().toList();\r\n\r\n    // everything works fine for comparisons of ordered collections\r\n    Stopwatch stopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted();\r\n    assertThat(range100)\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .isEqualTo(range100);\r\n    System.out.println(stopwatch);  // 176.6 ms\r\n    stopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted();\r\n    assertThat(range1000)\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .isEqualTo(range1000);\r\n    System.out.println(stopwatch);  // 53.10 μs\r\n    stopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted();\r\n    assertThat(range10000)\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .isEqualTo(range10000);\r\n    System.out.println(stopwatch);  // 32.40 μs\r\n\r\n    List<Integer> reversed100 = IntStream.range(0, 100).boxed()\r\n            .sorted(comparing(x -> -x)).toList();\r\n    List<Integer> reversed1000 = IntStream.range(0, 1000).boxed()\r\n            .sorted(comparing(x -> -x)).toList();\r\n    List<Integer> reversed10000 = IntStream.range(0, 10000).boxed()\r\n            .sorted(comparing(x -> -x)).toList();\r\n\r\n    // but comparisons of unordered collections become slow very quickly\r\n    stopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted();\r\n    assertThat(range100)\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .ignoringCollectionOrder()\r\n            .isEqualTo(reversed100);\r\n    System.out.println(stopwatch);  // 153.8 ms\r\n    stopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted();\r\n    assertThat(range1000)\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .ignoringCollectionOrder()\r\n            .isEqualTo(reversed1000);\r\n    System.out.println(stopwatch);  // 1.471 s\r\n    stopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted();\r\n    assertThat(range10000)\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .ignoringCollectionOrder()\r\n            .isEqualTo(reversed10000);\r\n    System.out.println(stopwatch);  // 1.639 min\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3020/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11610443503,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs5gjNLLzwAAAAK0CU7v","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/11610443503","actor":{"login":"schlosna","id":54594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna","html_url":"https://github.com/schlosna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"722ef02db94d4b7915942011994c9f03f1cd188d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schlosna/assertj-core/commits/722ef02db94d4b7915942011994c9f03f1cd188d","created_at":"2024-01-26T15:57:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
