have an issue related to assertj-core 3.15.0.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm using check() method from AbstractSoftAssertions, I get only first fail from assertion passed to this method.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have following code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString text = \"assertJ-Core\";\r\nsoftly.check(() -> assertThat(text).startsWith(\"core\").isEmpty());\r\n```\r\n\r\nonly first assertion error will be caught (in this case \"startsWith\" assertion).\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's intended behaviour, but in my opinion it clashes with soft assertions purpose and chainability of assertions provided by AssertJ.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1800/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
