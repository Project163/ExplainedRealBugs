Summary\r\n\r\nI use the **assertj-assertions-generator-maven-plugin** with `<generateAssertionsForAllFields>true</generateAssertionsForAllFields>` for my project, as one of my objects has a private primitive field (`int`). When I run that object's `Assert`'s `has` method, `org.assertj.core.util.introspection.FieldSupport.readSimpleField(FieldSupport.java:193)` sparks an `ExceptionInInitializerError`. Before that, it throws and catches a `ClassCastException`:  `java.lang.ClassCastException: Cannot cast java.lang.Integer to int`.\r\n\r\nOn further inspection, any primitive type except boolean causes this problem.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nPlease see attached:\r\n[ReadSimpleFieldExceptionInInitializerErrorSample.zip](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/files/1585116/ReadSimpleFieldExceptionInInitializerErrorSample.zip)\r\n\r\n#### Java 8 specific ?\r\nUntested, but I hypothesize not.\r\n\r\n* YES : create Pull Request from the `master` branch\r\n* NO  : create Pull Request from the `2.x` branch\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1141/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
