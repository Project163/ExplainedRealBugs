Summary\r\nWorking with code using streams, I saw code like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(acceptedStrings.stream().allMatch(filter::matches)).isTrue();\r\nassertThat(rejectedStrings.stream().noneMatch(filter::matches)).isTrue();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought about harnessing AssertJ power to improve the error messages, so I found out I could use the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(acceptedStrings).allMatch(filter::matches);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I could not find an equivalent for `Stream.noneMatch()`, and noticed `Stream.anyMatch()` has no equivalent in `ObjectEnumerableAssert` either!.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if `ObjectEnumerableAssert.noneMatch()` and `ObjectEnumerableAssert.anyMatch()` could be added.\r\n\r\n#### Java 8 specific ?\r\n\r\n* YES : create Pull Request from the `master` branch","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
