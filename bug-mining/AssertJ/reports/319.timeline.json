Overview\r\n\r\nThe following code looks up tracked exceptions in an instance field.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/blob/9692f7dc339765e9d7ef2725c89b3241c613268f/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/api/JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions.java#L45\r\n\r\nThe problem with doing that is that the tracked exceptions do not get reset between test method invocations if the test class is configured with `@TestInstance(PER_CLASS)` lifecycle semantics, since the test instance is cached along with the instance of `JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions` stored in an instance field.\r\n\r\nI became aware of this due to the following comment in JUnit's issue tracker: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1500#issuecomment-459720295\r\n\r\n## Affected Extensions\r\n\r\n- `JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions`\r\n- `JUnitJupiterBDDSoftAssertions`\r\n- any other extensions implemented in a similar manner\r\n\r\n## Proposals\r\n\r\nModify `JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions` so that it implements JUnit Jupiter's `BeforeEachCallback` extension API and clears the collected errors in `SoftProxies` before each test method.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to store the collected errors in Jupiter's `ExtensionContext.Store` for the currently executing scope.\r\n\r\n## Relate Issues\r\n\r\n- #1229
