Summary\r\n\r\nI did a search here but the suggestion doesn't seem to have been made.  When you create your own Condition class (fantastically versatile feature BTW), you can use either \"is\" or \"has\".  And, cleverly, the failure message uses the chosen verb.  Could you not let people use one or two other verbs, particularly \"satisfies\"?  A minor point, no doubt, but would improve readability.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\n<add example here>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Java 8 specific ?\r\n\r\n* YES : create Pull Request from the `master` branch\r\n* NO  : create Pull Request from the `2.x` branch\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/938/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
