Then the rest part can be the similar to assertContainsExactly, only modifying the failure information.\r\n\r\nI agree! \r\nIdeally the error message should indicate that we are checking the elements types but we can start using the generic `ShouldContainExactly` error message factory to get a feel of the error message and change it if we find it could be better.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/822163741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4610232072,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYxMDIzMjA3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/4610232072","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-19T04:51:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4610232074,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2MTAyMzIwNzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/4610232074","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-19T04:51:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4610232079,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYxMDIzMjA3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/4610232079","actor":{"login":"RGalways17","id":66765133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzY1MTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66765133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17","html_url":"https://github.com/RGalways17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RGalways17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-19T04:51:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4610232081,"node_id":"MDE1Ol
