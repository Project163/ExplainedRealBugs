Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using the `content()` operator on Files or Paths (which is a really nice feature introduced in #2252 and #2198, respectively), any customized messages set before the `content()` call will be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThis applies to messages being configured via `withFailMessage`, `overridingErrorMessage`, `as`, or `describedAs`.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nPath testfile = Paths.get(\"/tmp/lorem-ipsum.txt\");\r\n\r\nassertThat(testfile)\r\n.withFailMessage(\"Lorem ipsum does not start like the US constitution\")\r\n.content().doesNotStartWith(\"We, the people\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill revert to the default error message if the assertion fails.\r\n\r\n#### Workaround\r\n\r\nPlacing the message customization *after* the call to `content()` works as expected:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nPath testfile = Paths.get(\"/tmp/lorem-ipsum.txt\");\r\n\r\nassertThat(testfile).content().\r\n.withFailMessage(\"Lorem ipsum does not start like the US constitution\")\r\n.doesNotStartWith(\"We, the people\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo not a high priority issue as an easy workaround is available, however it may be a notable heads up.","closed_by":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2525/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2525/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
