Summary\n\nI would like to be able to check the result of the last soft assertion.\n#### Real life use case or example\n\n``` java\nPerson person = ...\nSoftAssertion soft = new SoftAssertions();\nif (soft.assertThat(person.getAddress()).isNotNull().wasSuccess()) {\n    soft.assertThat(person.getAddress().getStreet()).isNotNull();\n}\n```\n\nActual workaround is :\n\n``` java\nsoft.assertThat(person.getAddress()).isNotNull();\nif (person.getAddress() != null) {\n    soft.assertThat(person.getAddress().getStreet()).isNotNull();\n}\n```\n\nbut for more complex assertion, I must also write the equivalent boolean expression for the `if` statement.\n\nThe implementation is easy and need to set a flag to `false` at begin of `ErrorCollector.intercept` and, on failure, set the flag to `true`.\n#### Java 8 specific ?\n\nNO
