Javadoc doesn't compile, even after declaring appropriate constructors.\n\nWe should consider whether such a use case should be supported and how the API should be adjusted to ensure that type checking doesn't block it.\n\nAdditionally, we should favor `List.of` instead of `list`, and records for types like `Person` and `Doctor`.\n\nLastly, the [documentation](https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-for-iterable) should be updated accordingly.\n\n## Reproducer\n\n```java\n public class Person {\n   String name;\n
