error is explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29499847/ambiguous-method-in-java-8-why), basically it is due to the fact that `T` could implement an interface `I` and there is an `assertThat(I)` in `Assertions` making the compiler confused whether to use `assertThat(Date)` or `assertThat(I)`. I personally think the compiler is overzealous in this case :(\r\n\r\n@cbxp if you are on 3.8.0 then you can use `AssertionsForClassTypes` as its `assertThat` don't take any interface types which avoids the problem completely. Unfortunately I screwed up 3.9.0 by adding  `assertThat(CompletionStage)` to `AssertionsForClassTypes`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\tprotected static <T extends Date> T getDate() {\r\n\t\treturn (T) new Date();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tpublic void doesCompile() {\r\n\t\tAssertionsForClassTypes.assertThat(getDate()).isEqualTo(getDate());\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n so if you need 3.9.0 you have to cast to make it work.\r\n

running into this issue, using version 3.21.0.  I verified that the cast fixes the problem, along with now creating a silly-looking warning in Eclipse about unnecessary casts. However, the second workaround about adding AssertionsForClassTypes seems odd.  In the comments here, you simply added that qualification, and that's what I tried.  That results in a new compilation error \"Cannot infer type argument(s) for <T> extracting(Function<? super ACTUAL,T>)\". However, I see that at http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core.html#ambiguous-compilation-error you say something slightly different. You ALSO added the cast to the second workaround.  That fixes the compile error on the \"assertThat\" call, but of course it does, because the cast itself does that.  However, adding both the \"AssertionsForClassTypes .\" reference AND the cast results in a different compile error, on a later predicate.\r\n\r\nMy original code line is this:\r\n```\r\n        assertThat(wlsCartNode.at(\"/losgs/losg16170729/lineItems/128579015349\").withArray(\"payments\"))\r\n            .extracting(jn -> jn.at(\"/paymentTenderReference\").asText())\r\n            .doesNotContain(PaymentConstants.PAYMENT_TENDER_COF);\r\n```\r\nThis gets the error:\r\n```\r\nThe method assertThat(Predicate<Object>) is ambiguous for the type ...\r\n```\r\nIf I change it to:\r\n```\r\n\t\tassertThat(((JsonNode)(wlsCartNode.at(\"/losgs/losg16170729/lineItems/128579015349\").withArray(\"payments\"))))\r\n\t\t\t\t.extracting(jn -> jn.at(\"/paymentTenderReference\").asText())\r\n\t\t\t\t.doesNotContain(PaymentConstants.PAYMENT_TENDER_COF);\r\n```\r\nIt compiles without error (and works).\r\n\r\nIf I instead use the second workaround, as specified at http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core.html#ambiguous-compilation-error , not in this issue, as this:\r\n```\r\n        AssertionsForClassTypes.assertThat(((JsonNode)(wlsCartNode.at(\"/losgs/losg16170729/lineItems/128579015349\").withArray(\"payments\"))))\r\n        .extracting(jn -> jn.at(\"/paymentTenderReference\").asText())\r\n        .doesNotContain(PaymentConstants.PAYMENT_TENDER_COF);\r\n```\r\nIt gets an error on the last line, saying \"The method doesNotContain(String) is undefined for the type AbstractObjectAssert<capture#75-of ?,String>\".\r\n\r\nI see that if I try to add a new predicate before that one and just enter \"doesNot\" and let it show me completions, it shows me \"doesNotHave(Condition)\" and some other related choices.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1004403149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidmichaelkarr","id":5566419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjY0MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5566419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmichaelkarr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1004406302","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/839#issuecomment-1004406302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/839","id":1004406302,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs473gYe","user":{"login":"davidmichaelkarr","id":5566419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjY0MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5566419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmichaelkarr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmichaelkarr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-03T22:41:09Z","updated_at":"2022-01-03T22:41:09Z","body":"In
