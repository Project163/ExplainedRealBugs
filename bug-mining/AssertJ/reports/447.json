Summary\r\n`MapAssert` throws NPE on `null` key and value, if `Map` implementation does not accept `null` values like `java.util.Map#of(*)`.\r\nFor `List` there ist a special method  `ListAssert#doesNotContainNull()`.\r\nMaybe `MapAssert` should also have special treatment for `null` keys and values.\r\nAt least the negative verification methods shouldn't throw an exception.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(List.of(\"a\", \"b\")).doesNotContainNull(); // OK\r\n\r\nassertThat(Map.of(\"a\", \"b\")).containsValue(null); // NPE\r\nassertThat(Map.of(\"a\", \"b\")).containsKey(null); // NPE\r\n\r\nassertThat(Map.of(\"a\", \"b\")).doesNotContainKey(null); // NPE\r\nassertThat(Map.of(\"a\", \"b\")).doesNotContainValue(null); // NPE\r\n```\r\n\r\nrun with
