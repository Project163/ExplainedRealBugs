for explanation. \nI just checked that in assertj 1.5 there was an mistake in `org.assertj.core.internal.Objects#areEqual` (actual param was swapped with expected). \nThis issue was fixed in assertj 1.7 and that's why old assertions(which compared timestamp with date) stopped working.\nI agree with your argumentation that assertj reflects Java behaviour but it could be nice if I would compare timestamp with date. For now in assertj there is no easy method to do it (or Am I wrong ?).\nIMHO it could be useful to have method similar to :\n    org.assertj.core.api.AbstractDateAssert#isEqualToIgnoringMillis(java.util.Date)\nbut which will do not ignore millis. What do you think ?\nMethod `isEqualToIgnoringMillis` works fine:\n\n```\nDate releaseDate = new Date();\njava.sql.Timestamp sqlDateTimestamp = new java.sql.Timestamp(releaseDate.getTime());\nassertThat(releaseDate).isEqualToIgnoringMillis(sqlDateTimestamp); // assertion passed\nassertThat(sqlDateTimestamp).isEqualToIgnoringMillis(releaseDate); // assertion passed\n```\n\nSo If I want to compare dates (and compare also millis) I would use just `isEqualTo` , but this method do not work for sql time stamp what we proof.\nMaybe some method like 'isEqualDateTime' would be more intuitive ?\nI would create a branch and add such method if you would like ?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/63475344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tomaszszlek","id":9800429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDA0Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9800429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek","html_url":"https://github.com/tomaszszlek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaszszlek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/63537002","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/273#issuecomment-63537002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/273","id":63537002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTM3MDAy","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-18T20:15:13Z","updated_at":"2014-11-18T20:15:13Z","body":"I

\nExpecting:\n <\"1970-01-01T01:00:01 (Timestamp@3e8)\">\nto be equal to:\n <\"1970-01-01T01:00:01 (Date@3e8)\">\nbut was not.\n```\n\nI know the method `assertThat(Date date).hasSameTimeAs(Date date)` has been added since the issue #273, it would be nice to add the same method for a String : `assertThat(Date date).hasSameTimeAs(String dateAsString)`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14496679208,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAIX3Vs4C7OMqzwAAAANgEcUo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14496679208","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-02T23:46:50Z","label":{"name":"type:
