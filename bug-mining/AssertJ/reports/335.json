":"#### Summary\r\n\r\nStandardComparisonStrategy compares unboxed floating point values in an unexpected and arguably incorrect way around positive and negative zero.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nWhile refactoring tests to take advantage of assertj fluent assertions for better failure messages, I found a case that fails after the migration in some cases:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- assertThat( floatA >= floatB).isTrue();\r\n+ assertThat(floatA).isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(floatB);\r\n```\r\nThe new code fails when floatA is `-0f` and be is `0f` due to natural ordering based on Comparable, but is unexpected in this case.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
