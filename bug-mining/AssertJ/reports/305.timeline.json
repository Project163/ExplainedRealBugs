Overview\r\n\r\n- JUnit 5 version: **`5.2.0`**\r\n- Kotlin version: **`1.2.30`**\r\n\r\nHello, I am trying to use the [Programmatic Extension Registration via Static Fields](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-registration-programmatic-static-fields) to register an extension in tests written in the Kotlin programming language.  However, I cannot get the `beforeAll` method to be called.  Note that using the `@BeforeAll` annotation works fine.\r\n\r\nNote that to have \"static\" methods in Kotlin, one must use the `@JvmStatic` annotation inside an `object`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example 1: Working `@BeforeAll` annotation:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass TestBeforeAllAnnotation {\r\n    companion object {\r\n\r\n        var setMeBeforeAllTests :String? = null\r\n\r\n        @JvmStatic\r\n        @BeforeAll\r\n        fun annotatedBeforeAll() {\r\n            setMeBeforeAllTests = \"before\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun testAnnotatedBeforeAll() {\r\n        assertEquals(\"before\", setMeBeforeAllTests) // OK\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2: Non-working `BeforeAllCallback` extension registration\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass BeforeAllCallBackExtension : BeforeAllCallback {\r\n\r\n    val atConstructionTime = \"done\"\r\n\r\n    var fromBeforAllCall: String? = null\r\n\r\n    override fun beforeAll(context: ExtensionContext?) {\r\n        println(\"BEFORE ALL CALLED\")\r\n        fromBeforAllCall = \"before\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass TestProgrammaticExtension {\r\n    companion object {\r\n        @JvmStatic\r\n        @RegisterExtension\r\n        val extension = BeforeAllCallBackExtension()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun filedAtConstructionTimeWorks() {\r\n        assertEquals(\"done\", extension.atConstructionTime) // OK\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun fieldSetInCallBackFails() {\r\n        assertEquals(\"before\", extension.fromBeforAllCall) // FAILS\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1500/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/459730073","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1418#issuecomment-459730073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1418","id":459730073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTczMDA3Mw==","user":{"login":"Sam-Kruglov","id":23556336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTU2MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23556336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov","html_url":"https://github.com/Sam-Kruglov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-01T13:55:59Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T13:55:59Z","body":"See

just tried using [this AssertJ feature](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-news.html#assertj-core-3.11.0-junit5-soft-assertions)\r\n\r\nThe following test class fails both tests but should only faild test `one`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.assertj.core.api.JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Nested;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.TestInstance;\r\nimport

JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions#afterEach and also place a breakpoint to log `this.hashcode()` when `errors` is not empty.\r\n\r\nThe problem is actually fixed by removing the nested class and just putting both tests into the root. Or by placing the field and setUp into the nested class.

could I get some feedback to see if I'm on the right track addressing this issue ?\r\n\r\nTo avoid having a `SoftProxies` field, I have refactored the soft assertions in AssertJ to let each concrete implementation to provide access to a `SoftProxies` through the `getProxies()` method. \r\n\r\nExcept for the JUnit5 ones, all concrete soft assertions implementation classes define their own `SoftProxies` field with `getProxies()` to access it.\r\n\r\nWhere I need your feedback is for the Junit5 implementations as the one below:\r\n\r\n```java \r\npublic class JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions extends AbstractStandardSoftAssertions implements BeforeEachCallback, AfterEachCallback {\r\n\r\n  private static final Namespace ASSERTJ_JUNIT_EXTENSION_NAMESPACE = Namespace.create(\"AssertJ\");\r\n  private static final String SOFT_PROXIES_KEY = \"JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions SoftProxies\";\r\n  private final AssertionErrorCreator assertionErrorCreator = new AssertionErrorCreator();\r\n  private Store store;\r\n\r\n  // is used by errorsCollected() which gets the errors from the SoftProxies instance in use when the tests ran.\r\n  @Override\r\n  protected SoftProxies getProxies() {\r\n    return store.get(SOFT_PROXIES_KEY, SoftProxies.class);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void afterEach(ExtensionContext extensionContext) {\r\n    List<Throwable> errors = errorsCollected();\r\n    if (!errors.isEmpty()) assertionErrorCreator.tryThrowingMultipleFailuresError(errors);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void beforeEach(ExtensionContext extensionContext) throws Exception {\r\n    store = extensionContext.getStore(ASSERTJ_JUNIT_EXTENSION_NAMESPACE);\r\n    store.put(SOFT_PROXIES_KEY, new SoftProxies());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation makes the `AssertJSoftAssertionsExtensionTests` test case to behave correctly with `test2` passing (same for @Sam-Kruglov test case).  \r\n\r\nWhat I'm not too sure of is if it's ok to have a `Store` field but if I don't have this field I don't know how to get the `SoftProxies` in the `getProxies()` implementation. Is there a way to get the current `ExtensionContext` in `getProxies()` ? If so I could get rid of the field.\r\n\r\nAnother question is whether I can reuse `ASSERTJ_JUNIT_EXTENSION_NAMESPACE` in `JUnitJupiterBDDSoftAssertions`, I believe it makes sense to reuse it as it is the global assertj namespace.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/497938150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2382669114,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM4MjY2OTExNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/2382669114","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-01T11:49:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2382669115,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzODI2NjkxMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/2382669115","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-01T11:49:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2382669116,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM4MjY2OTExNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/2382669116","actor":{"login":"Sam-Kruglov","id":23556336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTU2MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23556336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov","html_url":"https://github.com/Sam-Kruglov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sam-Kruglov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-01T11:49:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"i
