I tried to update the assertj version in my project from 1.6.1 to 1.7.0 but I got compilation errors in some tests because the method `isEqualToComparingFieldByField` can't be found anymore. \n\nMy class looks like this: \n\n``` java\npublic class MyClass implements Comparable<MyClass> {\n ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the test I was writing something like this:\n\n``` java\nMyClass first = ...\nMyClass second = ...\n\nassertThat(first).isEqualToComparingFieldByField(second);\n```\n\nThis worked in version 1.6.1 but breaks in 1.7.0. \n\nI think the reason for this is issue #207. Before this change when calling `assertThat` the variant with the signature `<T> ObjectAssert<T> assertThat(T actual)` was used. After the change now `<T extends Comparable<T>> GenericComparableAssert<T> assertThat(T actual)` is used instead which has no `isEqualToComparingFieldByField` method.\n\nAm I missing something? Can this be fixed or is there a workaround to still use the assertion for Comparable's? Maybe this breaking change can be mentioned in the changelog.\n\nThanks for support and thanks for the great library!\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
