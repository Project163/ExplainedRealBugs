Summary\r\nIn my case I have two complex objects which have a \"value\" member variable of type \"Object\". When I compare two of those objects via \"usingRecursiveComparison()\" and one of the objects has a double value and the other an integer value, I get a ClassCastException instead of a  ComparisonFailure as expected.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nThis behavior can also be reproduced via a simplified comparison: \r\n```java\r\nassertThat(Double.MAX_VALUE).usingRecursiveComparison().isEqualTo(Integer.MAX_VALUE) // ClassCastException instead of expected  ComparisonFailure\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this an expected/intended beahvior? Is there a workaround for more complex objects where the same field of type \"Object\" could have such incompatible types?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nThomas\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
