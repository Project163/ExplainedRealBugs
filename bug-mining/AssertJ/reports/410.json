Summary\r\n\r\nThe recursive does not set field location properly for maps and thus is not evaluating ignored fields rules properly.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMap<String, Object> mapA = Map.of(\"foo\", \"bar\", \r\n                                  \"description\", \"foobar\", \r\n                                  \"submap\", Map.of(\"subFoo\", \"subBar\", \"description\", \"subFooBar\"));\r\nMap<String, Object> mapB = Map.of(\"foo\", \"bar\", \r\n                                  \"description\", \"barfoo\", \r\n                                  \"submap\", Map.of(\"subFoo\", \"subBar\", \"description\", \"subBarFoo\"));\r\n\r\n// should work but fails\r\nassertThat(mapA).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                .ignoringFields(\"description\", \"submap.description\")\r\n                .isEqualTo(mapB);\r\nassertThat(mapA).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                .ignoringFieldsMatchingRegexes(\".*description\")\r\n                .isEqualTo(mapB);\r\n```\r\nwith the above maps, AssertJ should compare these fields (fieldname: actual value vs expected value)\r\n\r\n* foo : bar vs bar \r\n* description : foobar vs barfor\r\n* submap.subfoo: subBar vs subBar\r\n* submap.description: subFooBar vs subBarFoo\r\n\r\ninstead it compares actual expected values without field location:\r\n\r\n* \"\" : bar vs bar \r\n* \"\" : foobar vs barfor\r\n* \"\": subBar vs subBar\r\n* \"\": subFooBar vs subBarFoo\r\n\r\nThe fix consists in properly setting the field location to the entry key.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
