However, since there is no byte-constant in java, you will have to cast each and every parameter value.\n\nIt would be useful to have integer-overloads of these methods.\n#### Example\n\nThe first example does not work. The two next ones are workarounds.\n\n``` java\n// Verify the magic number of a pdf-file by checking four first bytes\nassertThat(fileContent).startsWith(0x25, 0x50, 0x44, 0x46);\n\n// Java does not have byte constants, and ByteArrayAssert does not support integers, but...\nassertThat(fileContent).startsWith((byte) 0x25, (byte) 0x50, (byte) 0x44, (byte) 0x46);\nassertThat(fileContent).startsWith(new byte[] { 0x25, 0x50, 0x44, 0x46 });\n```\n#### Java 8 specific ?\n- NO  : create Pull Request from the `2.x` branch\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/729/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
