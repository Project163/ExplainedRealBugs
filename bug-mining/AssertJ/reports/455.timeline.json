@scordio , \r\nThe issue seems to come from the fact that the values in the Json are transformed into `IntNode`s and `TextNode`s.  \r\nBoth those classes are extending`ValueNode`, extending`BaseJsonNode`, extending `JsonNode`, implementing `Iterable<JsonNode>`.\r\n\r\nAnd because it implements `Iterable` the comparison gets caught by [if (dualValue.isExpectedFieldAnIterable()) in RecursiveComparisonDifferenceCalculator](https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/blob/main/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/api/recursive/comparison/RecursiveComparisonDifferenceCalculator.java#L252) instead of going through.\r\n\r\nIf we modify `DualValue` `isExpectedFieldAnIterable()` this way:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public boolean isExpectedFieldAnIterable() {\r\n    // Don't consider Path as an Iterable as recursively comparing them leads to a stack overflow, here's why:\r\n    // Iterable are compared element by element recursively\r\n    // Ex: /tmp/foo.txt path has /tmp as its first element\r\n    // so /tmp is going to be compared recursively but /tmp first element is itself leading to an infinite recursion\r\n    return expected instanceof Iterable && !(expected instanceof Path || expected instanceof ValueNode);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nthe following test fails with the right message:\r\n```java\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\r\n\r\nclass JsonTest {\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  void test() throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n    ObjectMapper om = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\r\n    JsonNode objectNode0 = om.readTree(\"{\\\"someNotImportantValue\\\":1,\\\"importantValue\\\":\\\"10\\\"}\");\r\n    JsonNode objectNode1 = om.readTree(\"{\\\"someNotImportantValue\\\":15,\\\"importantValue\\\":\\\"1\\\"}\");\r\n\r\n    assertThat(objectNode0).usingRecursiveComparison().isEqualTo(objectNode1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut that implies that the type `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ValueNode` is known at runtime, which might be complex if we can't add the dependency.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1007753182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"temp-droid","id":82510451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTEwNDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82510451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid","html_url":"https://github.com/temp-droid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5860061162,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs5BSRo0zwAAAAFdSW_q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5860061162","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-07T21:27:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5860061166,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs5BSRo0zwAAAAFdSW_u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/5860061166","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-07T21:27:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1007775872","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2459#issuecomment-1007775872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2459","id":1007775872,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs48EXCA","user":{"login":"temp-droid","id":82510451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTEwNDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82510451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid","html_url":"https://github.com/temp-droid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/temp-droid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-07T22:09:38Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T22:09:38Z","body":"Not
