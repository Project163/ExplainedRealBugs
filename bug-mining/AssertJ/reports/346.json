There is a workaround possible by using `hasStackTraceContaining`, but it would be nice if this was supported directly.\r\n\r\nSee also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38943346/assertj-assert-on-the-cause-message\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to do this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThatExceptionOfType(PersistenceException.class)\r\n    .isThrownBy(() -> {\r\n        // test code here\r\n    })\r\n   .withRootCauseInstanceOf(PSQLException.class)\r\n   .withRootCauseMessageMatching(\"Key (user_id)=(.*) is not present in table \\\"book\\\"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo to be consistent, probably the following new methods are needed:\r\n\r\n* `withRootCauseMessageStartingWith(String description)`\r\n* `withRootCauseMessageContaining(String description)` \r\n* `withRootCauseMessageContainingAll(CharSequence... values)`\r\n* `withRootCauseMessageNotContaining(String content)`\r\n* `withRootCauseMessageNotContainingAny(CharSequence... values)`\r\n* `withRootCauseMessageMatching(String regex)`\r\n* `withRootCauseMessageEndingWith(String description)`","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1776/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
