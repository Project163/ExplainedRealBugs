the bug**\r\nIf a getter throws an exception, it is not reported in the `AssertionError` from `hasFieldOrPropertyWithValue()`\r\n\r\n* assertj core version: 3.26.3\r\n* java version: 11\r\n* test framework version: junit 5.10.2\r\n\r\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\r\n\r\nclass ThrowingGetterTest {\r\n  @Test\r\n  void test() {\r\n    assertThat(new MyThrowingPojo())\r\n        .hasFieldOrPropertyWithValue(\"property\", \"value\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static class MyThrowingPojo {\r\n    public String getProperty() {\r\n      throw new RuntimeException();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting\r\n  AssertJTest$MyThrowingPojo@be64738\r\nto have a property or a field named \"property\"\r\n(static and synthetic fields are ignored)\r\n\r\n\tat AssertJTest.test(AssertJTest.java:9)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:566)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.ArrayList.forEach(ArrayList.java:1541)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.ArrayList.forEach(ArrayList.java:1541)\r\n```\r\n(no trace of the `RuntimeException` – note that the test succeeds when `getProperty()` returns `\"value\"`)\r\n\r\nThe problem appears to be that the nice `IntrospectionError` built by `PropertyOrFieldSupport#getSimpleValue()` is discarded in `org.assertj.core.internal.Objects#assertHasFieldOrProperty()`.\r\n\r\nIn my specific case, the object under test was implemented by proxy which was throwing the exception, which makes it really confusing.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
