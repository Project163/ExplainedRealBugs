Feature summary\nWhen comparing objects or maps, and actual map has keys that expected map doesnt, the error prints both maps and a message like this\n`actual and expected values are maps of different size, actual size=13 when expected size=12`.\n\n**In a map that has a lot of data**, it is very hard to find the unexpected key.\n\nHowever, when there is both a missing key and an unexpected key, a much more useful message is included in the error `The following keys were not found in the actual map value:  [\"product\"]`\n\n### Example1 (current behavior, helpful output)\n\n```java\nassertThat(Map.of(\"foo\", 1, \"bar\", 2))\n      .usingRecursiveComparison()\n      .isEqualTo(Map.of(\"foo\", 1, \"zoo\", 2));\n```\noutput (helpful, current
