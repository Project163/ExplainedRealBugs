Summary\r\n\r\nI have two types, an entity and a DTO, and they have a field called 'status', which are of different types but otherwise have identical constants. When using:\r\n\r\n    assertThat(entity)\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .ignoringAllOverriddenEquals()\r\n            .isEqualTo(dto)\r\n\r\ndifferences between the enum fields are not reported. I debugged a bit and turns out the 'equals' method is ignored for the fields (correctly, as I used 'ignoringAllOverriddenEquals') and they are attempted to be compared recursively again (i.e. their fields). There are no fields in these enums, so the difference is not reported at all.\r\n\r\nIgnoring equals is not taken into account for Java types (https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/blob/master/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/api/recursive/comparison/RecursiveComparisonConfiguration.java#L361)\r\n\r\nMaybe a similar exception should be made for enums, i.e. enums should be compared by using their name? Even if there are custom fields in the enums, the name check should be enough?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-08T07:52:11Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T07:52:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1939","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1939/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1939/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1939/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1939","id":652428437,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTI0Mjg0Mzc=","number":1939,"title":"ignoringAllOverriddenEquals

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using ignoringAllOverriddenEquals with lenient type comparison e.g. DTO, if a field on actual is an `enum` and the field on expected with the same name is a `String`, then that field is silently ignored.\r\nUsing a custom comparator for the field solves this but it's not obvious that it's required so can easily be missed currently.\r\nhttps://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-equals\r\n\r\nThe reverse scenario works fine and reports `expected field is an enum but actual field is not (java.lang.String)` rather than ignoring the field when there is no custom comparator.\r\n\r\nUsing a debugger I've found that in RecursiveComparisonConfiguration,\r\n```java\r\nSet<String> getNonIgnoredActualFieldNames(DualValue dualValue) {\r\n  Set<String> actualFieldsNames = Objects.getFieldsNames(dualValue.actual.getClass());\r\n```  \r\n  doesn't find any `actualFieldsNames` when `dualValue` actual is an `enum` e.g. PersonDTO.JobTitle\r\n  so the field `jobTitle` is ignored when comparing the fields.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class BlogPost {\r\n    Person author;\r\n}\r\npublic class BlogPostDTO {\r\n    PersonDTO author;\r\n}\r\npublic class Person {\r\n    String name;\r\n    String jobTitle;\r\n}\r\npublic class PersonDTO {\r\n    String name;\r\n    JobTitle jobTitle;\r\n\r\n    public enum JobTitle {\r\n        SOFTWARE_DEVELOPER,\r\n        QA_ENGINEER\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nPerson devPerson = Person.builder().name(\"Example Name\").jobTitle(\"SOFTWARE_DEVELOPER\").build();\r\nBlogPost devBlogPost = BlogPost.builder().author(devPerson).build();\r\nPersonDTO devPersonDTO = PersonDTO.builder().name(\"Example Name\").jobTitle(PersonDTO.JobTitle.SOFTWARE_DEVELOPER).build();\r\nBlogPostDTO devBlogPostDTO = BlogPostDTO.builder().author(devPersonDTO).build();\r\nPerson qaPerson = Person.builder().name(\"Example Name\").jobTitle(\"QA_ENGINEER\").build();\r\nBlogPost qaBlogPost = BlogPost.builder().author(qaPerson).build();\r\nPersonDTO qaPersonDTO = PersonDTO.builder().name(\"Example Name\").jobTitle(PersonDTO.JobTitle.QA_ENGINEER).build();\r\nBlogPostDTO qaBlogPostDTO = BlogPostDTO.builder().author(qaPersonDTO).build();\r\n\r\n// This is expected to fail but passes\r\n// qaBlogPost should not be equal to devBlogPostDTO but the jobTitle field appears to be ignored when there is no custom comparator\r\n// Expected behaviour (based on the reverse direction existing behaviour):\r\n// - failure due to not being able to compare an enum with a string for author.jobTitle\r\nassertThat(devBlogPostDTO)\r\n    .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n    .ignoringAllOverriddenEquals()\r\n    .isEqualTo(qaBlogPost);\r\n\r\n// This is expected to pass and does but it's odd that isEqualTo and isNotEqualTo both pass when comparing the same two objects\r\nassertThat(devBlogPostDTO)\r\n    .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n    .ignoringAllOverriddenEquals()\r\n    .isNotEqualTo(qaBlogPost);\r\n\r\n // Using a custom comparator avoids the issue\r\nassertThat(devBlogPostDTO)\r\n    .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n    .ignoringAllOverriddenEquals()\r\n    .withComparatorForFields((enumJobTitle, stringJobTitle) ->\r\n            (stringJobTitle == null && enumJobTitle == null)\r\n                || (stringJobTitle != null\r\n                && enumJobTitle != null\r\n                && stringJobTitle.equals(((PersonDTO.JobTitle) enumJobTitle).name())) ? 0 : 1,\r\n        \"author.jobTitle\"\r\n    )\r\n    .isNotEqualTo(qaBlogPost);\r\n\r\n// The reverse works OK already (this fails as expected with the output pasted below)\r\nassertThat(devBlogPost)\r\n    .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n    .ignoringAllOverriddenEquals()\r\n    .isEqualTo(devBlogPostDTO);\r\n```\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpecting:\r\n  <BlogPost(author=Person(name=Example Name, jobTitle=SOFTWARE_DEVELOPER))>\r\nto be equal to:\r\n
