assertThat(\"foo\".hashCode()).isEqualTo(\"foo\".hashCode());\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould be\r\n```java\r\n        assertThat(\"foo\").hasSameHashCodeAs(\"foo\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this example uses `String` it should work with any type of object, as every `Object` has a `hashCode`.\r\n\r\n#### Java 8 specific
