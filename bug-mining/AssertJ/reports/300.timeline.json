is a wonderful code generator for value types.  It has support for `Optional` types, but creates the wrapper object from a nullable field under the hood.\r\n\r\nImmutables also encourages bare-named property methods as opposed to bean-named.  (i.e. `property()` rather than `getProperty()`)\r\n\r\n`assertj` provides great support for extracting values from types.\r\n\r\nIn the case of mixing `immutables`, `assertj`, and optional types, some confusing behavior emerges!  For a property `OptionalInt property()`, the implementation will store `Integer property;` and implement `property() { return OptionalInt.ofNullable(property); }`.  `assertj` does not consider bare-named property methods for extraction, and instead cracks open the field.  But the field is a different type than the programmer expected!  This leads to confusing assertion mismatches, \"expected OptionalInt(42) got 42 instead\" and the like, and it's not at all immediately clear why.\r\n\r\nThe simplest fix is to add property support for methods that match the property name exactly, without the `get` or `is` prefix.\r\n\r\nI authored this code and release it under Apache 2.0 to the project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/470304874","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1458#issuecomment-470304874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1458","id":470304874,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDMwNDg3NA==","user":{"login":"stevenschlansker","id":129097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTA5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenschlansker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenschlansker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T22:34:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T22:34:49Z","body":"You
