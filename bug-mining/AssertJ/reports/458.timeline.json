@joel-costigliola, \r\nThanks for the advice. I will take a look at those issues. Maybe my initial analysis is of some use for you. It seems like `usingOverriddenEquals` ignores an overridden `equals` method of the root but respects  `equals` when comparing leaf objects. \r\nI wrote this test to make the behaviour repeatable:\r\n```java\r\nclass RecursiveComparisonAssert_isEqualTo_usingOverriddenEquals_Test {\r\n\r\n  public static class PersonWithOverriddenEquals {\r\n    String name;\r\n    String color;\r\n    Pet pet;\r\n\r\n    public PersonWithOverriddenEquals(String name, String color, Pet pet) {\r\n      this.name = name; // only name is used in equals\r\n      this.color = color;\r\n      this.pet = pet;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean equals(Object o) {\r\n      PersonWithOverriddenEquals person = (PersonWithOverriddenEquals) o;\r\n      return Objects.equals(name, person.name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int hashCode() {\r\n      return Objects.hash(name, color);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String toString() {\r\n      return String.format(\"Person [name=%s, color=%s]\", name, color);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static class Pet {\r\n    String name;\r\n    String type; // only type is used in equals\r\n\r\n    public Pet(String name, String type) {\r\n      this.name = name;\r\n      this.type = type;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean equals(Object o) {\r\n      Pet pet = (Pet) o;\r\n      return type.equals(pet.type);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int hashCode() {\r\n      return Objects.hash(type);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  \r\n  @ParameterizedTest(name = \"{2}: actual={0} / expected={1}\")\r\n  @MethodSource(\"comparison_uses_overriden_equals\")\r\n  void should_pass_when_comparison_using_overriden_equals(Object actual, Object expected) {\r\n    assertThat(actual).usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                      .usingOverriddenEquals()\r\n                      .isEqualTo(expected);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private static Stream<Arguments> comparison_uses_overriden_equals() {\r\n    // expected behaviour: PersonWithOverriddenEquals has an overridden equals method that only compares the field name. Therefore the following objects\r\n    // should be the same.\r\n    // actual behaviour: All fields of PersonWithOverriddenEquals are compared. However, the overridden equals method of Pet is respected.\r\n    PersonWithOverriddenEquals person1 = new PersonWithOverriddenEquals(\"John\", \"green\", new Pet(\"Ducky\", \"Duck\"));\r\n    PersonWithOverriddenEquals person2 = new PersonWithOverriddenEquals(\"John\", \"blue\", new Pet(\"Mia\", \"Duck\"));\r\n    return Stream.of(arguments(person1, person2));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nMy guess is that something has to change in RecursiveComparisonDifferenceCalculator#initDualValuesToCompare but I have not had the time to understand the code deep enough to come up with an idea.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1035958037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JanUrb","id":7629622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Mjk2MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7629622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb","html_url":"https://github.com/JanUrb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JanUrb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6049230842,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAIX3Vs5CtwuPzwAAAAFoj-_6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/6049230842","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-11T07:58:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6049230846,"node_id":"SE_lADOAIX3Vs5CtwuPzwAAAAFoj-_-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/6049230846","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-11T07:58:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6051536207,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs5CtwuPzwAAAAFosx1P","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/6051536207","actor":{"login":"uc4w6c","id":36355491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzU1NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36355491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c","html_url":"https://github.com/uc4w6c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uc4w6c/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ef3e8e95d00f350bff06fdef5304209466aca7c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uc4w6c/assertj-core/comm
