As example here are some git diff's between JUnit code and now after the conversion.\r\nCan you explain, what going wrong with that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are two examples for successful conversion:\r\n-    assertEquals(\"'ABcDe ='\", StringHandling.addSingleQuotes(\"ABcDe =\"));\r\n+    assertThat(StringHandling.addSingleQuotes(\"ABcDe =\")).isEqualTo(\"'ABcDe ='\");\r\n\r\n-    assertEquals(\"\\\"ABcDe =\\\"\", StringHandling.addDoubleQuotes(\"ABcDe =\"));\r\n+    assertThat(StringHandling.addDoubleQuotes(\"ABcDe =\")).isEqualTo(\"\\\"ABcDe =\\\"\");\r\n\r\nAnd here two example blocks which goes wrong:\r\n-    assertEquals(\"12.34\", StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"12.34\"));\r\n-    assertEquals(\"34.34\", StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"34,34\"));\r\n-    assertEquals(\"1234.34\", StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"1,234.34\"));\r\n-    assertEquals(\"1234.34\", StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"1.234,34\"));\r\n-    assertEquals(\"1234567.34\", StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"1,234,567.34\"));\r\n-    assertEquals(\"1234567.34\", StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"1.234.567,34\"));\r\n+    assertThat(StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"0\")).isEqualTo(\"0\");\r\n+    assertThat(StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"12.34\")).isEqualTo(\"12.34\");\r\n+    assertThat(34\")).as(\"34.34\").isEqualTo(StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"34);\r\n+    assertThat(234.34\")).as(\"1234.34\").isEqualTo(StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"1);\r\n+    assertThat(34\")).as(\"1234.34\").isEqualTo(StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"1.234);\r\n+    assertThat(234).as(\"1234567.34\").isCloseTo(StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"1, within(567.34\")));\r\n+    assertThat(34\")).as(\"1234567.34\").isEqualTo(StringHandling.fixFPNumberFormat(\"1.234.567);\r\n\r\n-    assertEquals(\"/home/linhrowe/Source/java/JCompPosition/examples/test_gencadpanel.cad\", StringHandling.changeFileExtension(\"/home/linhrowe/Source/java/JCompPosition/examples/test_gencadpanel.pnl\", \"cad\"));\r\n+    assertThat(StringHandling.changeFileExtension(\"/home/linhrowe/Source/java/JCompPosition/examples/test_gencadpanel.pnl\",\"cad\").isEqualTo(\"/home/linhrowe/Source/java/JCompPosition/examples/test_gencadpanel.cad\"));\r\n\r\nIf you need further informations, please contact me.\r\n\r\nBye\r\nRoman\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
