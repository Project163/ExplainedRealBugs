it does not indeed, actual is converted to a list  that's why is displayed \"nicely\".\r\nWe could display expected like a list for `isEqualTo` but it might be misleading because if will never be equal to actual because actual is a list but even if it was a Stream it would not be equal, you can verify that by executing `Stream.of(1, 2, 3).equals(Stream.of(1, 2, 3))` which returns false.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I want \r\n```java\r\nassertThat(Stream.of(1, 2, 3)).isEqualTo(Stream.of(1, 2, 3));\r\n``` \r\nto return an error like:\r\n```\r\norg.junit.ComparisonFailure: \r\nExpected :Stream(1, 2, 3)\r\nActual   :Stream(1, 2, 3) \r\n```\r\nthat would hide the fact that Stream don't override `equals`.\r\n\r\nI think here AssertJ does not a great job at showing its limitations, Stream assertions have been implemented by converting actual to a list and then using list assertions, that works well for most of the assertions except for assertions like `isEqualTo` or `isSameAs`.\r\n\r\nIt may be time to have first class support for `Stream`, if we do so there will always be other limitations, no assertions chaining as you can only consume a stream once.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/307064791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1115245473,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTExNTI0NTQ3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1115245473","actor":{"login":"dpinol","id":1954955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol","html_url":"https://github.com/dpinol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-08T10:30:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1115245474,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExMTUyNDU0NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1115245474","actor":{"login":"dpinol","id":1954955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol","html_url":"https://github.com/dpinol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpinol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-08T10:30:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1115245475,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxMTE1MjQ1NDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1115245475","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-08T10:30:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via
