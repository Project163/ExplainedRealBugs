a back ground issue from our project here: \nhttps://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues/5925\n\nthe general idea is we want to generate helper methods in the generated Assert classes to aid navigation through deeply nested models. The background is the Kubernetes model is very deeply nested. \n\nFor a complex model where you want to write assertions like:\n\n```\nassertThat(foo.getBar().getThing()).isNotNull()\n```\n\nthe problem is the getBar() could return null as could the getThing(). \n\nSo we wanna do this instead...\n\n```\nassertThat(foo).bar().thing().isNotNull();\n```\n\nwhere each property method `bar()` and `thing()` are kinda like the `hasBar()` function thats generated OOTB, only it returns the assertThat() of the value. So the last assertion - `.isNotNull()` could be anything really; `isEqualTo()` or whatever.\n\ne.g. we generate functions like this:\n\n```\nclass FooAssert ... {\n\n   public BarAssert bar() {\n      isNotNull();\n\n      return (BarAssert) assertThat(actual.getBar()).describedAs(toString() + \".bar\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI've managed to implement the above in our project using the extensible templates (thanks for that!) - but to do so I needed to add the above 2 properties to the templates. Actually as of writing only the 2nd one is required but figured I may as well submit a PR for both

this PR is merged and issue fixed https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator/issues/67 along with the NavigationListAssert class in assertj-core: https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/641 it would be easy to switch the OOTB templates in the generator to use the 'navigation' model approach. \n\nSo that for every property of an object we generate exactly one navigation method that lets users chain assertions together; reusing all the methods from ListAssert and NavigationListAssert for iterable properties or the custom typed assertions for other properties. \n\nThis would result in much smaller code generated for the assertion classes and much more power. The only downside is some of the current methods would be a tad more verbose. \n\ne.g. for a generated assertion class with a name property the current generated code would be:\n\n``` java\n// current generated code\nassertThat(person).hasName(\"James\");\n\n// new minimal code\nassertThat(person).name().isEqualTo(\"James\");\nassertThat(person).name().contains(\"m\");\n...\n```\n\nDitto for iterable properties right now we generate a few methods which are mostly already included in ListAssert. e.g. all these assertion methods are available on any generated iterable property method:\nhttps://github.com/jstrachan/assertj-core/blob/7b1d079edeb5ac984cebbed77a65025718ee7673/src/test/java/org/assertj/core/navigation/ListNavigation_Test.java#L56-L62\n\nRemoving the old generated methods would break folks code I guess; so maybe we should add a flag to switch to the new more concise model?\n\nIf you are interested; here are the 2 new templates (which need minor tweaks

have succeeded in making `NavigationListAssert` with a class instead of an `AssertFactory`, it can be used like that:\n\n``` java\nList<String> list =  newArrayList(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\");    \nassertThat(list, StringAssert.class).first().startsWith(\"o\");\n```\n\nIt requires though few lines of ugly reflection code to handle the case where you want to build an `ObjectAssert`, for example if the value to test is a `Car` trying to build an `ObjectAssert` by refelction fails as there is no `ObjectAssert` constructor taking a car.\n\nThe comment I made on the syntax can be addressed with a method reference:\n\n```\nassertThat(vehicles, Assertions::assertThat);\n```\n\nNot as readable as passing the assert class IMO but providing a  `AssertFactory` is probably more flexible than relying on some reflection code.\n\n@jstrachan  Any thoughts
