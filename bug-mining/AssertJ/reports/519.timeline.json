\r\nThe simplest solution here would be to replace `==` comparison with `equals()` comparison.\r\nThis will have a side effect causing any test that compares `0.0` to `-0.0` to fail (currently

`equals()`.\r\n\r\nI propose to replace `==` check with `equals()` check and also state clearly in the javadoc which is used.\r\n\r\nAs this is potentially a breaking change for an edge case I'd like
