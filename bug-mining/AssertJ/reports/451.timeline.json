@scordio , I started looking into this and was wondering how to approach some parts.\r\n\r\n1. I think we could create a new `Representation` for this? That we could activate with `.withMultilines` for example. (similar to `.inUnicode`).\r\n2. Should the double quotes by kept? My actual (basic) solution would produce something like:\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \r\nexpected: \r\n  \"<xml>\r\n    <value>B</value>\r\n  </xml>\"\r\n but was: \r\n  \"<xml>\r\n
