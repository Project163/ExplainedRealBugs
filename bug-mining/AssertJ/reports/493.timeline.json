looked a bit more into this, and I don't think it's possible to write a general hash code function that matches the recursive comparison, as with certain configurations the recursive comparison may not define an equivalence relation. This is most obvious with configuration options like `ignoreAllActualNullFields` which isn't symmetric or transitive. In this case, whether `expected.x` should be compared (and so included in the hash calculation) depends on the nullness of `actual.x`. There are other configurations that violate the equivalence relation conditions in less obvious ways.\r\n\r\nI think it's still possible to improve on the current behaviour though.
