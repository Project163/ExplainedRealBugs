While `entry` is actually part of the class `Assertions`, `newLinkedHashMap` is not found anywhere. Actually, it's a private method of `Maps_assertContainsExactly_Test`, and I guess the examples in the Javadoc were copied from there.\r\n\r\nAssertJ actually provides something similar, `org.assertj.core.util.Maps.newHashMap(K, V)`, but it only takes a key and a value.\r\n\r\nDo you think it would be possible to have `newLinkedHashMap` (or something similar, I think there's a `mapOp` somewhere else in a few tests?) to which we can pass results of `entry` in the `Assertions` so that maps for assertions can be easily built? Or at least do you think it would be better to update Javadoc? Indeed, I found the Javadoc confusing in that respect and I tried to find newLinkedHashMap somewhere with no success.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
