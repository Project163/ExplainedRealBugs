currently signals that certain fields are `public` or `package-private` instead of `private` to allow them to be tested.\n\nSuch details are internal concerns of AssertJ, and there shouldn't be an annotation with `public` visibility to mark such cases, as the annotation can potentially be (mis)used by AssertJ users.\n\nWhen deprecating the annotation, we should also check how to reduce the visibility of `public` annotated fields to at least `package-private`.\n\nSee also:\n* https://x.com/OlivierCroisier/status/1882105845263048720\n*
