However, that implementation evolved and there might be more to be considered (e.g., #2379) so best to look at the current state of `containsOnly` assertions.\r\n\r\nOne of the main challenges here is probably the testing pattern: we would like to have something similar to `Maps_assertContainsOnlyKeys_Test` for thorough coverage, going through all the map implementations available in our test
