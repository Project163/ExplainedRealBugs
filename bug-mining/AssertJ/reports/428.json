Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using case insensitive maps the map assertions for containsOnly are not working correctly.\r\nThe reason for this is due to the fact that the actual map is copied into a `LinkedHashMap` and thus the checks are not using the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMap<String, String> map = new LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap<>();\r\nmap.put(\"TEST\", \"value\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following assertions will pass\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(map).containsKey(\"test\");\r\nassertThat(map).contains(entry(\"test\", \"value\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following assertions will fail\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(map).containsOnlyKeys(\"test\");\r\nassertThat(map).containsOnly(entry(\"test\", \"value\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: `LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap` is from Spring.\r\n\r\nIf you agree I can work on a PR to change the mechanism that is used for validating `containsOnly` entries.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2159/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
