Summary\r\n\r\nWhen we have more complicated objects structure it will be useful to have possibility to check that all fields for actual object and all fields in included object are also not null. \r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    class Author {\r\n        String name;\r\n        String email;\r\n\r\n        Author(String name, String email) {\r\n            this.name = name;\r\n            this.email = email;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class Book {\r\n        String title;\r\n        Author author;\r\n\r\n        Book(String title, Author author) {\r\n            this.title = title;\r\n            this.author = author;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testHasNoNullFieldsOrProperties() {\r\n        Book book = new Book(\"title\", new Author(null, null));\r\n        assertThat(book).hasNoNullFieldsOrProperties();\r\n        assertThat(book.author).hasNoNullFieldsOrProperties();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nassertion `assertThat(book).hasNoNullFieldsOrProperties()` will pass and it is true\r\nsecond assertion `assertThat(book.author).hasNoNullFieldsOrProperties()` will fail and it is also ok.\r\n\r\nWhen we have object with many other object we must write many assertions for each fields.\r\nWhen we add new field to object we must also remember to add new assertion.\r\n\r\n#### Proposition\r\n \r\nassertion `assertThat(book).hasNoNullFieldsOrProperties()` should fail because object `book.author` has fields with `null` values.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2211/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2211/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
