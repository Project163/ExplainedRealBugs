make it easier for us to review and accept your PR.\r\n\r\nMy solution is a little different than what was proposed in the original issue. I added a `usingRecursiveAssertion()` rather than adding onto `usingRecursiveComparison()` -- mostly because recursive assertion really isn't comparison at all.\r\n\r\nI reused code from recursive comparison where possible, so recursive assertion supports some of the same ignore rules. In addition recursive assertion can be configured to ignore primitives, to include JCL types and can be configured for different ways of handling collections and maps.\r\n\r\nI also added a convenience method for asserting not null, because I expect that to be used most frequently.\r\n\r\nInterested to hear what you guys think. Please let me know whether the documentation is up to your standard.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/962442729","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2211#issuecomment-962442729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2211","id":962442729,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs45XbXp","user":{"login":"BenTels","id":5958372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTgzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5958372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels","html_url":"https://github.com/BenTels","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenTels/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-06T12:13:24Z","updated_at":"2021-11-06T12:13:24Z","body":"Submitted
