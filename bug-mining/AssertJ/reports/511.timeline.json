you for the assertj project, it makes reading & writing tests enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI am curious if there is a timeline for 3.25.2 release with the fix for this issue. We have had to roll back a number of projects to 3.24.2 due to tests using recursive comparison timing out and failing.\r\n\r\nThank you!","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1901099549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"schlosna","id":54594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna","html_url":"https://github.com/schlosna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1901133407","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3320#issuecomment-1901133407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3320","id":1901133407,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5xUP5f","user":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-19T21:22:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T21:22:46Z","body":"@schlosna
