*This may also affect other interfaces (like Throwable?).*\r\n\r\nWell, `Throwable` is not an interface - but yes, as I discovered yesterday, this is a generic problem that affects classes that implement more than one interface. I had an object that implemented both `Predicate` and `Comparable` and had the same problem (couldn't get `assertThat()` to resolve the method without a cast to `(Predicate<String>)`). \r\n\r\nI think it would be nice if we had a more generic approach to this problem. One possibility is to do what osgi-test has done and add the static `assertThat()` entry point to each individual assertion type. So in this case you could type ComparableAssert.assertThat(object) to get your `ComparableAssert` instance. Of course, you could just call `new ComparableAssert()` directly, but it's not the most fluent API.\r\n\r\nOn this point, I also noticed that `AssertionsForInterfaceTypes` inherits from `AssertionsForClassTypes`. Is this necessary? There doesn't seem to be a need for `AssertionsForInterfaceTypes` to inherit from `AssertionsForClassTypes` - if people want a single entry point containing both, they can simply use `Assertions`. On the other hand, I fear that this inheritance exacerbates the ambiguity problem by creating additional possibilities for ambiguity when invoking `AssertionsForInterfaceTypes.assertThat()`.\r\n\r\n(As an aside, I also think the compiler could also be more helpful here by telling you which are the candidate methods that can't be disambiguated.)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1060054952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kriegfrj","id":7224087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7224087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegfrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6191304700,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAIX3Vs5Evvg6zwAAAAFxB8_8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/6191304700","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-07T00:19:57Z","milestone":{"title":"3.23.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1060074781","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2504#issuecomment-1060074781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2504","id":1060074781,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs4_L3Ud","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-07T00:22:17Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T00:22:17Z","body":"Let's see if we can address that issue with `AssertionsForInterfaceTypes` not inheriting `AssertionsForClassTypes` and use it for disambiguate imports.\r\nWe can certainly add `ComparableAssert.assertThat` as another way of addressing the issue too.
