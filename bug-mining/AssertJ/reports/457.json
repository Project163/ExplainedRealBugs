Summary\r\ncomparingOnlyFields(*fields) selects fields not by a complete match, but selects fields for comparison starting with argument\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nExample code on Kotlin:\r\n```java\r\n   @Test\r\n  fun staffUpdateDeletedStaff() {\r\n   ....\r\n      entityAssertionWithFields(\r\n           actualSraff,\r\n           expectedStaff,\r\n           \"firstName\", \"lastName\", \"description\", \"defaultRole\", \"enabled\", \"deleted\"\r\n      )\r\n  }\r\n\r\n   private fun entityAssertionWithFields(actual: Any, expected: Any, vararg fields: String) {\r\n        assertThat(actual)\r\n            .describedAs(describe)\r\n            .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n            .comparingOnlyFields(*fields)\r\n            .isEqualTo(expected)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the running this test the following error is returned:\r\n```\r\nExpecting actual:\r\n  Staff(id=2703, enabled=true, inviteAccepted=false, email=bot+1633407660446@test.com, firstName=Deleted staff, lastName=deleted Staff, description=Deleted, createdAt=Tue Oct 05 11:21:00 NOVT 2021, updatedAt=2021-10-05T04:21:05.863+00:00, name=First Staff Bot Name Last Staff Bot Name, deletedAt=Tue Oct 05 11:21:05 NOVT 2021, deleted=true, twofaRequireSetup=false, password=null, defaultRole=MANAGER, defaultRoleName=MANAGER, groups=null, loginProviderType=PASSWORD)\r\nto be equal to:\r\n  Staff(id=null, enabled=true, inviteAccepted=null, email=bot+1633407660446@test.com, firstName=Deleted staff, lastName=deleted Staff, description=Deleted, createdAt=null, updatedAt=null, name=null, deletedAt=null, deleted=true, twofaRequireSetup=null, password=null, defaultRole=MANAGER, defaultRoleName=null, groups=null, loginProviderType=null)\r\nwhen recursively comparing field by field, but found the following 2 differences:\r\n\r\nfield/property 'defaultRoleName' differ:\r\n- actual value  : \"MANAGER\"\r\n- expected value: null\r\n\r\nfield/property 'deletedAt' differ:\r\n- actual value  : 2021-10-05T11:21:05.813 (java.util.Date)\r\n- expected value: null\r\n```\r\nBut 'defaultRoleName' and 'deletedAt' fields are not specified for comparison.\r\n\r\nMay be is there a mistake in using these methods and something else needs to be done?\r\nCould you please tell me how can I use it right?\r\n\r\nVersion of assertj-core -
