like the feature that allows the user to override the `equals()` method for comparison.\r\nHowever, the current api creates unnecessary complications and appears to be a misuse of `Comparator`. `Comparator`s are intended for ordering objects, not testing equality. The contract for `Comparator.compareTo()` doesn't even require it to be consistent with `equals()`.\r\nIt would be simpler to allow the user to supply a `BiPredicate` to test for equality. This would allow users to simplify implementation (only two possible return values instead of three) and provide a cleaner
