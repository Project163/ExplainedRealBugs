Most of the time this is not a problem since usually streams do not hold a resource. However, it seems way too easy to create such a situation as the example shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfinal File myFile = new File(\"...\");\r\n\r\n// Best case: use of AssertJ API - proper resource handling\r\n// org.assertj.core.api.Assertions#linesOf(java.io.File)\r\nassertThat(linesOf(myFile)).contains(\"foo\");\r\n\r\n// Unlucky: when using java.nio.file.Files from the standard library (the \"more obvious / common\" solution),\r\n// the underlying I/O stream is not closed\r\n// Subsequent operations (such as removing the file in test cleanup routines) may fail depending on the OS.\r\nassertThat(Files.lines(myFile.toPath())).contains(\"bar\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\n\r\nClosing the stream may provide us with increased safety of use. I am currently not aware of any downsides of closing the stream right after materialization into a list. \r\nIf you agree this is a problem (and a proper fix), I would be happy to file a PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
