`maven-javadoc-plugin` has an option [detectLinks](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/jar-mojo.html#detectLinks) which enables detection of Javadoc links of dependent projects. The detection works only if the dependent project follows the default Maven conventions (javadoc must be located under `${project.url}/apidocs`).\r\n\r\nThe project URL of assertj-core is `https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core`. The Maven plugin first checks if the URL `https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core/apidocs/element-list` is accessible and then forwards the URL `'https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core/apidocs'` to the javadoc tool. \r\n\r\nBut the javadoc tool interprets the `#` character, reads the URL `https://assertj.github.io/doc/package-list` and obviously fails:\r\n```\r\nError fetching URL: https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core/apidocs/ (java.io.FileNotFoundException: https://assertj.github.io/doc/package-list)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can workaround this by defining in my project:\r\n```xml\r\n  <plugin>\r\n    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>\r\n    <configuration>\r\n      <dependencyLinks>\r\n        <dependencyLink>\r\n          <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>\r\n          <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>\r\n          <url>https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.assertj/assertj-core/${assertj.version}</url>\r\n        </dependencyLink>\r\n      </dependencyLinks>\r\n    </configuration>\r\n  </plugin>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe the project URL of assertj-core should be `https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.assertj/assertj-core/${assertj.version}` instead of `https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core`. But then the javadoc must be located under `https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.assertj/assertj-core/${assertj.version}/apidocs`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12930407786,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAIX3Vs6JEMNwzwAAAAMCtl1q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/12930407786","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-24T23:46:11Z","milestone":{"title":"3.26.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12932284763,"node_id":"AE_lADOAIX3Vs6JEMNwzwAAAAMC0wFb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/12932284763","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-25T10:31:13Z","assignee":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12935990277,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAIX3Vs6JEMNwzwAAAAMDC4wF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/12935990277","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-26T09:12:31Z","rename":{"from":"Navigation
