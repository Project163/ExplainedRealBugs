Summary\r\n\r\nI have recently discovered the `Representation` API. I am looking at using it with osgi-test and with idempiere-test as part of their respective domain-specific assertion libraries, so that they can produce more readable diagnostics by overriding `toString()` implementations in the domain objects.\r\n\r\nFor maximum usability and code readability, It would be nice if these Representation implementations could be auto-registered. AssertJ already provides a mechanism for this.\r\n\r\nHowever, ideally, different domain-specific libraries would be able to independently register `Representation` implementations for their specific settings  osgi-test and idempiere-test could independently register `Representation` implementations for their respective domains. For example, osgi-test could register a `Representation` implementation for the type `org.osgi.framework.Bundle` while idempiere-test could register one for `org.compiere.model.MInvoice`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with the current implementation, the default `Representation` implementation is a global singleton setting that is applied to all objects. \r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\n\r\nI'm open to ideas. I'm thinking something along these lines:\r\n\r\n1. Un-deprecate the `ServiceLoader` implementation of `Representation`. `Configuration` is by nature a singleton instance and not well-suited to the modular, multi-implementation approach being offered.\r\n2.  `Representation` will become parameterized. Thus:\r\n```java\r\npublic interface Representation<T> {\r\n  String toStringOf(T object);\r\n  String unambiguousToStringOf(T object);\r\n```\r\nSpecific implementations of `Representation` can add their own bounds, eg:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class BundleRepresentation implements Representation<Bundle> {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. AssertJ Core will collate all of the implementations and build a lookup table from object type to representation. This will be used by the core in determining which representation to use (if not overridden by a call to `usingReperesentation()`).\r\n\r\nI think it will be possible to build the lookup table with no further changes to `Representation`, using reflection to find out the bound on `T`. However, if it is not possible, then add a `supportedType()` method to `Representation` that the core can interrogate:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface Representation<T> {\r\n  String toStringOf(T object);\r\n  String unambiguousToStringOf(T object);\r\n  default Class<T> supportedType() {return (Class<T>)Object.class; }\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2048/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
