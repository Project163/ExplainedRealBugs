it is possible to conveniently check a file's content with `hasContent`, but not the opposite.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm regularly bumping into the absence of the possibility to directly analyse files as it is possible for strings, so to have something analogous to `assertThat(\"String\").contains` & `doesNotContain`. Of course one can do `assertThat(FileUtils.readFileToString(file))` but having syntactic sugar in assertJ to avoid this would be lovely as the brevity and clarity assertJ enables is one of it's main strengths IMHO.\r\nThese last two may be a separate feature request, however i wanted to gather general feedback about feasibility first.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
