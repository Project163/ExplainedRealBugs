are multiple assertions on CharSequence that allow ignoring or normalizing newlines. Unfortunately those methods differ in their writing of \"newline\" as part of the method name. E.g. when editing code to switch between these 2 methods, it is not sufficient to exchange `Ignoring` by `Normalizing`, you rather also have to switch between uppercase and lowercase `L`:\r\n\r\n[isEqualToIgnoringNew**L**ines](https://www.javadoc.io/static/org.assertj/assertj-core/3.23.1/org/assertj/core/api/AbstractCharSequenceAssert.html#isEqualToIgnoringNewLines(java.lang.CharSequence))\r\n[isEqualToNormalizingNew**l**ines](https://www.javadoc.io/static/org.assertj/assertj-core/3.23.1/org/assertj/core/api/AbstractCharSequenceAssert.html#isEqualToNormalizingNewlines(java.lang.CharSequence))\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable to deprecate and rename all methods containing `NewLines` to instead use the more common `Newlines`.
