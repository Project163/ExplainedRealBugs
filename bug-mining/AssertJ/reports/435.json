Summary\r\nHello\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create a custom equals for specific fields for the recursive comparison. \r\n\r\nFor example, I would like to return true in my custom equals method if actual value is greater than the expected value by 1 (don't ask me why :)):\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Example {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Foo actual = new Foo(2);\r\n        Foo expected = new Foo(1);\r\n\r\n        BiPredicate<Integer, Integer> greaterThan = (a, e) -> Objects.equals(a, e + 1);\r\n\r\n        Assertions.assertThat(actual)\r\n                .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                .withEqualsForFields(greaterThan, \"bar\")\r\n                .isEqualTo(expected);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static class Foo {\r\n\r\n        private final Integer bar;\r\n\r\n        private Foo(Integer bar) {\r\n            this.bar = bar;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example works well. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that the following example with the same initial values for the both entities also wouldn't throw any exception:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Example {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Foo actual = new Foo(1);\r\n        Foo expected = new Foo(1);\r\n\r\n        BiPredicate<Integer, Integer> greaterThan = (a, e) -> Objects.equals(a, e + 1);\r\n\r\n        Assertions.assertThat(actual)\r\n                .usingRecursiveComparison()\r\n                .withEqualsForFields(greaterThan, \"bar\")\r\n                .isEqualTo(expected);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static class Foo {\r\n\r\n        private final Integer bar;\r\n\r\n        private Foo(Integer bar) {\r\n            this.bar = bar;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI found the reason of this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/assertj/assertj-core/blob/43edf5862d5984af1a6882323874091455bdab3a/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/api/recursive/comparison/RecursiveComparisonDifferenceCalculator.java#L206\r\n\r\nAnd I want to know whether is it really necessary to check references here? Is it a bug? My opinion that custom comparators have to be invoked before/instead of this verification.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2335/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
