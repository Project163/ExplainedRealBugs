your statement about iterators, it was my understanding that iterators generally follow an order that is based on the implementation, but whether that order is known by the client or not depends on the nature of the data structure. For example, ArrayLists are purposefully designed to have ordering that is clear to the user at all times, while HashSets do not preserve an order that is consistently known by the user in order to prioritize speed. \r\n\r\nI'll have to hold off make any edits until that gets sorted I guess.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1107791545/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nith2001","id":75632283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjMyMjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75632283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001","html_url":"https://github.com/nith2001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nith2001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1107794074","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2548#issuecomment-1107794074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/2548","id":1107794074,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5CB5ia","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-24T08:52:45Z","updated_at":"2022-04-24T08:53:08Z","body":"`containsExactly` is not a good fit for some `Set` like `HashSets` (but it's fine for `SortedSets` or `LinkedHashSet`), on this one we expect users to know the semantics of the iterables being tested. If the iteration order is not consistent then the assertion will likely fail and that is fine since the iterable did not honor the assertion contract.\r\n\r\n`containsExactlyInAnyOrder` can be used with `HashSet` aspointed out by @sarajuhosova. \r\n\r\n> Plus, it seems that that IterableDiff_Test lacks testing with iterables that aren't ArrayLists where the ordering could be different, like HashSets.\r\n\r\nI agree that we could have used different iterable types but only those with consistent iteration order (so no `HashSet`).\r\n\r\nIn my experience we should not rely on `HashSet` iteration even though it could look consistent, I remember on one project tests that relied on this and failed once we migrated to a newer version of java that changes the underlying `HashSet` iteration order.\r\n\r\nSo moving forward, we should continue treating iterable as if they had a consistent iteration order for `containsExactly` and let users the responsibility to choose the correct assertion for `HashSet`, what we can do though is to enhance the javadoc with a warning to prefer `containsExactlyInAnyOrder` over `containsExactly` for `HashSet` or any iterable whose iteration order is not predictable.\r\n\r\nGood discussion

don't think it is important that the error handling be O(n), I don't even think it is possible.\r\nRationale being that tests should succeed most of the time, if they fail it's ok to take a bit more time to provide a good error
