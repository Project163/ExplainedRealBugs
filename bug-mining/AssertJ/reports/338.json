Summary\r\n\r\n`AbstractThrowableAssert#isInstanceOf()` throws an `IllegalAccessError` exception \r\nwhen assertj-core is used as a modular jar. \r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nThrowable thrown = new IllegalArgumentException();\r\nassertThat(thrown).isInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class);\r\n```\r\nBuilding and runing this example with JDK 9 or higher:\r\n```bash\r\nmvn package\r\njava -p target/modules -m example/example.Example\r\n```\r\noutputs the following error messages:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalAccessError: class org.assertj.core.util.Closeables (in module org.assertj.core) cannot access class java.util.logging.Logger (in module java.logging) because module org.assertj.core does not read module java.logging\r\n\tat org.assertj.core@3.14.0-SNAPSHOT/org.assertj.core.util.Closeables.<clinit>(Closeables.java:25)\r\n\tat org.assertj.core@3.14.0-SNAPSHOT/org.assertj.core.util.Throwables.getStackTrace(Throwables.java:172)\r\n\tat org.assertj.core@3.14.0-SNAPSHOT/org.assertj.core.error.ShouldBeInstance.<init>(ShouldBeInstance.java:67)\r\n\tat org.assertj.core@3.14.0-SNAPSHOT/org.assertj.core.error.ShouldBeInstance.shouldBeInstance(ShouldBeInstance.java:34)\r\n\tat org.assertj.core@3.14.0-SNAPSHOT/org.assertj.core.internal.Objects.assertIsInstanceOf(Objects.java:136)\r\n\tat org.assertj.core@3.14.0-SNAPSHOT/org.assertj.core.api.AbstractAssert.isInstanceOf(AbstractAssert.java:382)\r\n\tat example@1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/example.Example.main(Example.java:9)\r\n```\r\nThe problem happens because `org.assertj.core.util.Closeables` requires `java.logging` module both at compile-time and at runtime.\r\nAdding the following line to `src/main/java9/module-info.java` in asssertj-core repository will resolve the problem.\r\n```java\r\nrequires java.logging;\r\n```\r\nPlease find the attached project which reproduces the problem.\r\n[assertj-example.zip](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/files/3775868/assertj-example.zip)\r\n\r\nThank you.","closed_by":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1656/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
