is due to [`StandardRepresentation.toStringOf](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/blob/b82b86b2c54bb33c09103744ea0d7af4b37b4dee/src/main/java/org/assertj/core/presentation/StandardRepresentation.java#L160) that looks for `AtomicInteger` before `Collection`.\r\n\r\nOne simple fix would be to change the order by checking `Collection` before `AtomicInteger` (and more generally most specific types should be checked first, although it is not clear how to classify the types).\r\n\r\nYou have another option: [registering a custom representation](https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-representation) to specify how to format `VolatileSizeArrayList`. \r\nIf you choose to [register a Representation](https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-custom-representation-default-global-scope), you will be impacted by https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/1361 which will slightly change the way to register a Representation.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/480138966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4154262325,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQxNTQyNjIzMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/4154262325","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-29T10:31:57Z","milestone":{"title":"3.19.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4156276518,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE1NjI3NjUxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/4156276518","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"bab32787d7e8607be8b43151cdb3d0c87e177594","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/commits/bab32787d7e8607be8b43151cdb3d0c87e177594","created_at":"2020-12-30T04:55:33Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
