personally agree that the code extract of @AlexBischof should work.\n\nNote that I haven't looked at the code of assertj in detail yet, but it looks to me that `.isNotEmpty()` just does something like this (and yes, I am quite sure that this is not how things work internally):\n\n``` java\n// \"it\" is the iterator here\npublic boolean isNotEmpty()\n{\n    try {\n        underlyingIterator.next();\n        return true;\n    } catch (NoSuchElementException ignored) {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nwhich in turn would trigger the `NoSuchElementException` in the code example.\n\nNow, another important thing to bear in mind here is that an `Iterable` and and `Iterator` are not quite the same thing. An `Iterable` is supposed to produce a fresh `Iterator` each time you call its `.iterator()` method; but this is not quite the same thing as testing an `Iterator` in itself.\n\nIn other words, an `Iterator` produced by an `Iterable` is independent from any other `Iterator` produced by that same `Iterable`.\n\nAs such I believe that it is incorrect to \"promote\" the test of an `Iterator` to that of `Iterable`, and that dedicated assertions for `Iterator`s are worth considering.\n\nFor instance:\n\n``` java\nassertThat(iterator).hasNext();\nassertThat(iterator).nextElement().is*();\n// or even chain\n```\n\nComments?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/102712541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fge","id":550006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDAwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/550006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge","html_url":"https://github.com/fge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":306619115,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA2NjE5MTE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/306619115","actor":{"login":"AlexBischof","id":7299851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTk4NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7299851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexBischof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-05-16T23:59:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":306619116,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNjYxOTExNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/306619116","actor":{"login":"AlexBischof","id":7299851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTk4NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7299851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexBischof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBischof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-05-16T23:59:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/102719979","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/414#issuecomment-102719979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/414","id":102719979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjcxOTk3OQ==","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin"

states clearly that assertions on an Iterator will consume it in most of the case. It was an easy solution to provide `Iterator` assertions.\n\nHaving said that, I agree that checking that an Iterator has elements left should not consume it.  \n\n@fge My gut feeling is that having specific `Iterator` assertions will require a lot of work if you want to support the richness of `Iterable` assertions.
