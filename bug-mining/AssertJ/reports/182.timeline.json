We have a number of Hibernate-managed database POJOs. These POJOs have Date fields. For example:\n\n``` java\npublic class Pojo {\n     private Date dateCreation;\n     private Date dateUpdate;\n     private String field1;\n\n     // getters + setters\n}\n```\n\nWe have logic to persist them towards a test database, and then, to verify them mapping we retrieve them again. At that time we want to ensure that the values which we saved to the database are the same as the ones we received from the database.\n\nTherefore, we would like to use the isEqualToComparingFieldByField() method because that is what we intend to do.\n\nThe database however tends to use subclasses of java.util.Date, like java.sql.Timestamp or java.sql.Date. They are never equal to the input which is saved into the database, as those are java.util.Date instances. However they still refer to the same point in time, and that is actually what I want to verify in this test case.\n\nSo two solutions would fit my needs:\n1. A possibility to specify a comparator for a specific type. From design-perspective I do believe this would be the better solution.\n2. A possibility to specify a generic comparator, which does special logic for handling the Date case. For this approach I've developed a comparator at this moment and have some extension code for AssertJ in my project, however I personally doubt that this is the best solution for the AssertJ library itself.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/41362612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kmoens","id":5837260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzcyNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5837260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens","html_url":"https://github.com/kmoens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmoens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/58520846","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/198#issuecomment-58520846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/198","id":58520846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTIwODQ2","user":{"login":"mpi","id":495676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTY3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/495676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi","html_url":"https://github.com/mpi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-09T14:50:27Z","updated_at":"2014-10-09T14:50:27Z","body":"@kmoens I have a similar scenario.
