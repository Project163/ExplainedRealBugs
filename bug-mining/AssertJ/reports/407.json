love AssertJ, but I find the sequencing of many of the error messages to be counterintuitive.\r\n\r\nTake for example:\r\n\r\n> Expecting: `<actual>` to be equal to: `<expected>` but was not.\r\n\r\n[Per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)):\r\n\r\n> The most common use of the colon is to inform the reader that what follows the colon proves, explains, defines, describes, or lists elements of what preceded it.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when I begin reading that assertion error message my mind is, well, _expecting_ to see \"Expecting: `<expected>`\", not \"Expecting: `<actual>`\".  It's only when I read the closing, \"but was not\" that I realize I've interpreted the whole error message backwards.\r\n\r\nI believe something like the following would be more intuitive and concise:\r\n\r\n> Expected: `<expected>`, but was: `<actual>`.\r\n\r\nI realize this may be a matter of personal preference, or of locale, so I'm filing this issue mainly to see if others find the current message style counterintuitive as well.\r\n\r\nIf enough do, maybe the solution would be to just change it, or perhaps some sort of localization or message style facility could be introduced to make it configurable.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1324/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
