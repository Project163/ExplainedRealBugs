Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using the `content()` operator on Files or Paths (which is a really nice feature introduced in #2252 and #2198, respectively), any customized messages set before the `content()` call will be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThis applies to messages being configured via `withFailMessage`, `overridingErrorMessage`, `as`, or `describedAs`.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```java\r\nPath testfile = Paths.get(\"/tmp/lorem-ipsum.txt\");\r\n\r\nassertThat(testfile)\r\n.withFailMessage(\"Lorem ipsum does not start like the US constitution\")\r\n.content().doesNotStartWith(\"We, the people\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill revert to the default error message if the assertion fails.\r\n\r\n#### Workaround\r\n\r\nPlacing the message customization *after* the call to `content()` works as expected:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nPath testfile = Paths.get(\"/tmp/lorem-ipsum.txt\");\r\n\r\nassertThat(testfile).content().\r\n.withFailMessage(\"Lorem ipsum does not start like the US constitution\")\r\n.doesNotStartWith(\"We, the people\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo not a high priority issue as an easy workaround is available, however it may be a notable heads
