you for your fast reply. I think there is an inconsistency between JavaDoc of `HashSet#contains` and the method implementation. `HashSet#contains` is just delegating the call to its internal HashMap. On this `containsKey()` is called, in there the objects hash is build and with this `getNode` is called. So I think the JavaDoc there is misleading. \r\n\r\nBut I also think, there are many usecases where you implement your own equals and hashcode methods and maybe you want to change fields, which are used in this methods. \r\n\r\nFor sure we should tell the oracle developers that the JavaDoc is not correct, because there is no equals operations directly on the `HashSet#contains`-method. I will open a bugreport on the JDK. If you don´t want to change your api behavior, maybe you can leave a comment on your code? :-)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/340243421/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/340248462","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1104#issuecomment-340248462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1104","id":340248462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDI0ODQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"filiphr","id":6012094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTIwOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6012094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr","html_url":"https://github.com/filiphr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-29T09:28:37Z","updated_at":"2017-10-29T09:28:37Z","body":"I am not sure if this is an actual bug in JDK. See [this SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8805807/workaround-for-hash-for-a-hashset-when-the-internal-object-changes) that actually searches for a workaround for changing hash of an object.\r\n\r\nThe JavaDoc of `HashSet#contains` is correct, as it uses `HashMap#contains` and it uses equals. However, in `HasMap` and `HashSet` implementations `equals` is used only when there is a hash collision. In this case there is no object that matches the new hash.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this inconsistence exists in AssertJ is that everything is reduced down to an `Iterable`, which is then iterated and an `equals` check is done to check that an object is contained or not. Maybe we need to check if an `Iterable` is actually a `Collection` and call the collection specific methods for that. This way we can be sure that the correct JDK expectations are used.\r\n\r\nAnd finally I also agree with @joel-costigliola one should not change hash of elements added to a `HashSet` and `HashMap`, as it can lead to a lot of inconsistent behaviour.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/340248462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"filiphr","id":6012094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTIwOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6012094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr","html_url":"https://github.com/filiphr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/filiphr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1315463191,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTMxNTQ2MzE5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1315463191","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-29T09:28:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1315463192,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzMTU0NjMxOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1315463192","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-29T09:28:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/341264146","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1104#issuecomment-341264146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1104","id":341264146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTI2NDE0Ng==","user":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchu

The following code example is greatly simplified, but demonstrates the basic mechanics (in a real example, the creation of the set would be encapsulated within the class under test).\r\n\r\n```java\r\nTreeSet<String> mySet = new TreeSet<>(Comparator.comparing(String::toUpperCase));\r\nmySet.add(\"FOO\");\r\nassertThat(mySet.contains(\"foo\")).isTrue(); // passes\r\nassertThat(mySet).contains(\"foo\"); // fails\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found it surprising that the assertion didn't really call `mySet.contains()`, but looking into the AssertJ codebase I found that it was highly abstracted.\r\n\r\nI can work around it by passing in an element comparator, like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(mySet).usingElementComparator(mySet.comparator()).contains(\"foo\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in a real application, the set would probably have come from a method just returning `Set<String>`, so accessing its comparator is mostly out of the question. And even if I did, it just wouldn't feel like I was actually testing that my class returned a case-insensitive set.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1517201688,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDE1MTcyMDE2ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1517201688","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-12T20:33:51Z","milestone":{"title":"3.10"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/372798846","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/1104#issuecomment-372798846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1104","id":372798846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjc5ODg0Ng==","user":{"login":"nach-o-man","id":1958095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTgwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1958095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man","html_url":"https://github.com/nach-o-man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nach-o-man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T20:00:17Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T20:00:25Z","body":"@joel-costigliola
