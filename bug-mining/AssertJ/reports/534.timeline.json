the bug**\n\nAs part of solving https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2988, https://github.com/assertj/assertj/commit/835c1dc3aee2348eb234f3209488fdd078702c2f changed how maps were checked for equality with a new `filterIgnoredFields` function. This function uses Java's `Collectors.toMap` to convert a stream back to a map, which internally uses `uniqKeysMapAccumulator`, which throws a `NullPointerException` if any map entry values are null.\n\nThis is not ideal for a testing framework, which should be designed to handle all kinds of possible map scenarios, including ones with null entry values. Please replace this `toMap` call ([deeplink](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/commit/835c1dc3aee2348eb234f3209488fdd078702c2f#diff-f64c53f85fc4dab2341ef1f3d02beecf1347b3c9f5df1e7467782c04d6afeee4R693)) with a different function to convert to a map which allows for null values, for example this one suggested in Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24630963/nullpointerexception-in-collectors-tomap-with-null-entry-values/32648397#32648397. Thanks!\n\n* assertj core version: [3.27.0](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/releases/tag/assertj-build-3.27.0)\n* java version: 21\n\n**Test case reproducing the bug**\n\n```java\n  @Test\n  public
