Let's take `AbstractOptionalAssert.contains` implementation as an example:\r\n```java\r\n  public SELF contains(VALUE expectedValue) {\r\n    isNotNull();\r\n    if (!actual.isPresent()) throwAssertionError(shouldContain(expectedValue));\r\n    if (!optionalValueComparisonStrategy.areEqual(actual.get(), expectedValue))\r\n      throwAssertionError(shouldContain(actual, expectedValue));\r\n    return myself;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIf we don't propagate potential errors in `isNotNull()` then we will be executing `if (!actual.isPresent())` with a null `actual`, this is not the correct behavior, we should have stopped the assertion.\r\n\r\nThere is a solution to your suggestion though, the real improvement here is not about soft assertions but to change `zipSatisfy` so that it collects all errors instead of failing at the first one.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/371434745/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1510752900,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTUxMDc1MjkwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1510752900","actor":{"login":"MikeShysh","id":13480390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDgwMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13480390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeShysh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-08T09:42:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1510752901,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1MTA3NTI5MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1510752901","actor":{"login":"MikeShysh","id":13480390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDgwMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13480390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeShysh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeShysh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-08T09:42:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1510753111,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1MTA3NTMxMTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/1510753111","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":n
