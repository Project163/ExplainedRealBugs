In practice, the types for which custom assertions will be written will likely have a much more complex hierarchy of classes. How should we deal with this case?\n\nAn example, for clarity:\n\n``` java\nclass Human {\n  public String name;\n}\nclass Employee extends Human {\n  public String jobTitle;\n}\n```\n\n``` java\nclass HumanAssert extends AbstractAssert<HumanAssert, Human> {\n  public HumanAssert(Human actual) {\n    super(actual, HumanAssert.class);\n  }\n\n  public HumanAssert hasName(String name) {\n    isNotNull();\n    assertThat(actual.name).isEqualTo(name);\n    return this;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, how to craft `EmployeeAssert`? Thus far I've been doing the following:\n\n``` java\nclass EmployeeAssert extends HumanAssert {\n  private final Employee actual;\n\n  public EmployeeAssert(Employee actual) {\n    super(actual);\n    this.actual = actual;\n  }\n\n  public EmployeeAssert hasJobTitle(String jobTitle) {\n    isNotNull();\n    assertThat(actual.jobTitle).isEqualTo(jobTitle);\n    return this;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis mostly works and allows chained assertions like:\n\n``` java\nassertThat(employee).hasJobTitle(\"CEO\").hasName(\"John Smith\");\n```\n\nbut does not allow:\n\n``` java\nassertThat(employee).hasName(\"John Smith\").hasJobTitle(\"CEO\");\n```\n\nsince the return type of `hasName` is `HumanAssert` rather than `EmployeeAssert`.\n\nIf you extrapolate this case to hierarchies that are three or four classes deep you can quickly see it becomes a mess in forcing your assertions to be written in descending order of the hierarchy if you want to continue chaining.\n\nThis can be solved with this (thnaks to by Jake Wharton) :\n\n``` java\nclass AbstractHumanAssert<S extends AbstractHumanAssert<S, A>, A extends Human> extends AbstractAssert<S, A> {\n  public AbstractHumanAssert(A actual, Class<S> selfType) {\n    super(actual, selfType);\n  }\n\n  public S hasName(String name) {\n    isNotNull();\n    Assertions.assertThat(actual.name).isEqualTo(name);\n    return myself;\n  }\n}\n\nclass HumanAssert extends AbstractHumanAssert<HumanAssert, Human> {\n  public HumanAssert(Human actual) {\n    super(actual, HumanAssert.class);\n  }\n}\n\nclass AbstractEmployeeAssert<S extends AbstractEmployeeAssert<S, A>, A extends Employee> extends\n    AbstractHumanAssert<S, A> {\n  public AbstractEmployeeAssert(A actual, Class<S> selfType) {\n    super(actual, selfType);\n  }\n\n  public S hasJobTitle(String title) {\n    isNotNull();\n    Assertions.assertThat(actual.jobTitle).isEqualTo(title);\n    return myself;\n  }\n}\n\nclass EmployeeAssert extends AbstractEmployeeAssert<EmployeeAssert, Employee> {\n  public EmployeeAssert(Employee actual) {\n    super(actual, EmployeeAssert.class);\n  }\n}\n\nclass AbstractUnitedStatesEmployeeAssert<S extends AbstractUnitedStatesEmployeeAssert<S, A>, A extends UnitedStatesEmployee>\n    extends AbstractEmployeeAssert<S, A> {\n  public AbstractUnitedStatesEmployeeAssert(A actual, Class<S> selfType) {\n    super(actual, selfType);\n  }\n\n  public S isInState(String state) {\n    isNotNull();\n    Assertions.assertThat(actual.state).isEqualTo(state);\n    return myself;\n  }\n}\n\nclass UnitedStatesEmployeeAssert\n    extends AbstractUnitedStatesEmployeeAssert<UnitedStatesEmployeeAssert, UnitedStatesEmployee> {\n  public UnitedStatesEmployeeAssert(UnitedStatesEmployee actual) {\n    super(actual, UnitedStatesEmployeeAssert.class);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCertainly not ideal, but it works for all permutations listed in the previous comment.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
