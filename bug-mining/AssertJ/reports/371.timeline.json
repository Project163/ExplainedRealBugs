Only that many number are neither.\r\n\r\nI'm far from being a mathematician, but the topic seems a bit more complicated when we move to rational numbers (i.e., floating point numbers), e.g. from [Math StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3013028/generalized-definition-of-parity)\r\n\r\n> The notion of parity can be extended to many rings - but certainly not all rings, since if 2 has an inverse 𝑢 then 2𝑢=1 ⇒2∣1∣𝑥 so everything is \"even\". So we can't extend it to all rationals, but if we restrict to the subring of rationals with odd denominator then integer parity has a unique extension: the parity of 𝑚/(2𝑛+1) is the parity of 𝑚, by mod2: (2𝑛+1)−1≡1−1≡1.\r\n\r\nAlso, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AParity_(mathematics)#Parity_of_any_rational_number_can_be_determined):\r\n\r\n> A fraction is even if the numerator is, therefore all rational numbers have parity.\r\n\r\nIMHO I would keep floating point types out for now and we can always change it if the community sees the benefit of those assertions also there.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/604973416/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Cal027","id":49466119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDY2MTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49466119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027","html_url":"https://github.com/Cal027","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cal027/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T14:34:22Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T14:34:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darkliang/assertj-core/issues/8","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darkliang/assertj-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darkliang/assertj-core/issues/8/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darkliang/assertj-core/issues/8/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darkliang/assertj-core/issues/8/events","html_url":"https://github.com/darkliang/assertj-core/pull/8","id":614781412,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDE1MjY1ODU5","number":8,"title":"Add
