Summary\r\n\r\nCreate new assertion on `AbstractIterableAssert` that verifies type of each element of iterable taking order into consideration.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nI am working currently with following code where it's important to verify that elements are of correct type in particular order:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<CredentialsProvider> credentialsProviders = ....;\r\n\r\nassertThat(credentialsProviders).hasSize(3);\t\t\r\nassertThat(credentialsProviders.get(0)).isInstanceOf(AWSStaticCredentialsProvider.class);\r\nassertThat(credentialsProviders.get(1)).isInstanceOf(EC2ContainerCredentialsProviderWrapper.class);\r\nassertThat(credentialsProviders.get(2)).isInstanceOf(ProfileCredentialsProvider.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitial though was to replace these 3 lines with \r\n```java\r\nassertThat(credentialsProviders).hasOnlyElementsOfTypes(AWSStaticCredentialsProvider.class, EC2ContainerCredentialsProviderWrapper.class, ProfileCredentialsProvider.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut it does not verify the order of types.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to create an assertion that would verify if all elements of an iterable match given type like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(credentialsProviders).containsOnlyElementsOfTypes(AWSStaticCredentialsProvider.class, EC2ContainerCredentialsProviderWrapper.class, ProfileCredentialsProvider.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am happy to implement it if you confirm it's a good idea or propose another solution to the problem
