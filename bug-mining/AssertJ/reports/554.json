Feature summary\nToday, after changing some DTO field's type from List<Integer> to Integer[], I've discovered that the `ignoringCollectionOrder` from `RecursiveComparisonAssert` class doesn't consider arrays as collections\n\nAll my former tests that was passing on such DTOs were failing all the sudden because of this change\n\nFair enough, arrays are not Collections strictly speaking.\n\nBut I've googled quite some time without finding any workaround for such a case.\n\nEither I didn't searched for such an existing feature at the right place, or it's not existing\n\nIn the later case, I guess the logic behind this missing capacity is that, most of the times, arrays are used for performance matters, with potentially huge quantity of data, so maybe they are more likely to be subject to O(N2) complexity problematic ?\n\nAnyway, from my point of view, it would be cool to also have a dedicated flag allowing for order agnostique arrays comparisons.\n\n#### Example\n\n```java\nclass UsingRecursiveComparisonFailsOnArrays {\n\n\tstatic class Person {\n\n\t\tString name;\n\t\tInteger[] scores;\n\n\n\t\t// Constructor, getters, setters\n\t\tpublic Person( String name, Integer[] scores ) {\n\t\t\tthis.name = name;\n\t\t\tthis.scores = scores;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\n\tpublic static void main( String[] args ) {\n\t\tPerson person1 = new Person( \"Alice\", new Integer[] { 90, 80, 70 } );\n\t\tPerson person2 = new Person( \"Alice\", new Integer[] { 70, 90, 80 } );\n\n\t\tAssertions.assertThat( person1 )\n\t\t\t.usingRecursiveComparison()\n\t\t\t.ignoringArraysOrder() // create a new ignoringArraysOrder option or alike ?\n\t\t\t.isEqualTo( person2 ); // this should pass\n\n\t\tAssertions.assertThat( person1 )\n\t\t\t.usingRecursiveComparison()\n\t\t\t.ignoringCollectionOrder()\n\t\t\t.isEqualTo( person2 ); // this will fail\n\t}\n\n}\n\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
