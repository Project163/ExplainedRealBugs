After some operation say 3 distinct rows are green.\r\nI have `List<String> allRows ` with row values\r\ntest so far is checking:\r\n```\r\nallRows.get(1).contains(status_green) &&\r\nallRows.get(3).contains(status_green) &&\r\nallRows.get(4).contains(status_green) == true\r\n```\r\nSo to remove redundancy, i can do something like:\r\n`asssertThat(status_green).isIn(allRows.get(1),allRows.get(3),allRows.get(4))`\r\nbut this is **wrong** because this would have to be **isOnlyValueIn** (can this be added?)\r\ni can reverse it into ugly but working:\r\n`assertThat(Arrays.asList({allRows.get(1)..get(3)..get(4)}).containsOnly(status_green)`\r\nSo is there any chance to have **varargs assertThat** like (example with plain integers) \r\n`assertThat(1,2,3).containsOnly(1);`\r\nBut my problem also lies in those repeated gets. Some **multiGet** would be great. Like \r\n`assertThat(allRows).get/filter(1,3,4).containsOnly...`\r\n_(This stays in AssertJ domain and I could not find library with List allowing multiGet)_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1466/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
