behavior of the recursive comparison has changed in 3.23.0 indeed when fixing https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2466, because we know in java 17 we won't be able to compare java types using reflection (which is what the recursive comparison does), the recursive comparison now uses java types `equals` to compare them.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that `Path2D.Float` does not overrides `equals` and thus compare them by reference.\r\n\r\nI don't feel there is a going back from allowing to introspect java types but we should certainly have highlighted better in the release notes. Here's an issue with java 17 type introspection https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2927.\r\n\r\nHaving said that not all hope is for your test case, the best course of action is to register a
