I've noticed the same problem with assertions other `isNotNull`.  \n\nFor example, the `TolkienCharacterAssert.hasName` method as written in the [documentation](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-custom-assertions.html) will cause a `NullPointerException` if the `actual != null` and `actual.getName() === null`.  My instinct to fix that would be add a new assertion method that validated that the name is not `null`:\n\n``` java\npublic TolkienCharacterAssert nameIsNotNull() {\n        isNotNull();\n\n        if (actual.getName() == null) {\n            failWithMessage(\"Expected character's name to be not null but was null.\");\n        }\n        return this;\n    }\n```\n\nThen I would replace `isNotNull()` with `nameIsNotNull()` in the `TolkienCharacterAssert.hasName` method as below.  This would guard against `actual` or `actual.getName()` being `null`. \n\n``` java\npublic TolkienCharacterAssert hasName(String name) {\n        // check that actual TolkienCharacter we want to make assertions on is not null.\n        nameIsNotNull();\n\n        // check condition\n        if (!actual.getName().equals(name)) {\n            failWithMessage(\"Expected character's name to be <%s> but was <%s>\", name, actual.getName());\n        }\n\n        // return the current assertion for method chaining\n        return this;\n    }\n```\n\nWhen this version of `hasName` is called on a `TolkienCharacter` whose `name` is `null`, the behavior differs depending on whether or not it is called softly.\n\nNot softly:\n\n``` java\nTolkienCharacter namelessCharacter = new TolkienCharacter(); // Name is null.\nTolkienCharacterAssert.assertThat(namelessCharacter).hasName(\"any name\");\n// Result is Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.AssertionError: Expected character's name to be not null but was null.\n```\n\nSoftly:\n\n``` java\nTolkienCharacter namelessCharacter = new TolkienCharacter(); // Name is null.\nTolkienSoftAssertions softly = new TolkienSoftAssertions();\nsoftly.assertThat(namelessCharacter).hasName(\"any name\");\nsoftly.assertAll();\n// Result is an NPE in the call to actual.getName().equals(name) in hasName\n```\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/117251030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"paul-ko","id":8765283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjUyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8765283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-ko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":344433847,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ0NDMzODQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/344433847","actor":{"login":"paul-ko","id":8765283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjUyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8765283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-ko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-30T16:45:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":344433917,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQzNDQ0MzM5MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/344433917","actor":{"login":"paul-ko","id":8765283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjUyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8765283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-ko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-ko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-30T16:45:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/117599351","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/447#issuecomment-117599351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/447","id":117599351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzU5OTM1MQ==","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T10:47:11Z","updated_at":"2016-06-18T07:30:04Z","body":"Soft assertions internally work with proxied method, where the original method call is intercepted and any assertion error captured.\n\nThe difference between the call to `isNotNull();` and `Objects.instance().assertNotNull(info, actual)` is that the former is in proxied call context, `hasName` being the outer proxied call and `isNotNull();` the inner one while the latter is normal call from a proxied call (`hasName`).\n\nOk, bear with me.\n\nLike every direct call to soft assertion the error (if any) is captured and the \"normal\" execution flow of the program continue, this is what makes soft assertions not failing at the first assertion error.\n\nIt turns out that executing `isNotNull();` in a proxied context will make the \"normal\" execution flow of program continue which is executing `if (!actual.getName().equals(name))` leading to the NPE.\nNote that the assertion error is correctly captured, this is why you have it if you avoid the NPE by executing `if (actual.getName() != null && !actual.getName().equals(name))`.\n\nOn the other hand, `Objects.instance().assertNotNull(info, actual)` is not executed in an inner proxied call, it's a \"normal\" call, throwing an assertion error captured by the proxied `hasName`.\n\nNow that we have the explanation, I see two solutions:\n- avoid calling a proxied method in an already proxied method\n- don't create a new proxy context if one already exists\n\nThe second solution is obviously the better one but I'm not sure yet it is feasible, still more investigation to do ...
