based on : https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=pl#!topic/assertj/eoVf40zBYsU\n\nI am using collections assertions (f.e. assertThat(someList).toContainsOnly(otherList)) but when assertion fails, it has non formatted message.\n\nBy non formatted message I mean that it looks like:\nto contain only:\n<[SomeObject[key='someValue', value='false'], SomeObject[key=othervalue', value='false'], SomeObject[key='yeAnotherValue', value='false'], SomeObject[key='superValue', value='true']]>\n\nis would be helpful (improve readability )if following format could be possible:\nto contain only :\n<[SomeObject[key='someValue', value='false'], \nSomeObject[key=othervalue', value='false'], \nSomeObject[key='yeAnotherValue', value='false'], \nSomeObject[key='superValue',
