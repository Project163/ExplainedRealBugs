looked at this a bit, and am now questioning whether it is worth doing. I'm pretty confident that a null entry doesn't make sense and the only time it would come up is if there is a bug in the map implementation, which seems like a pretty obscure case.\r\n\r\nHere's what I looked \r\n\r\nThe change to StandardRepresentation is straightforward:\r\n```\r\n  protected String toStringOf(Map<?, ?> map) {\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n      if (entry == null) {\r\n        builder.append(\"null\");\r\n      } else {\r\n        builder.append(format(map, entry.getKey())).append('=').append(format(map, entry.getValue()));\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get \"containsKey\" to work, internal/Maps.java needs a change as well:\r\n```\r\n  private static <K> boolean containsKey(Map<K, ?> actual, K key) {\r\n    try {\r\n      return actual.containsKey(key);\r\n    } catch (NullPointerException e) {\r\n      return false;\r\n//      if (key == null) return false; // null keys not permitted\r\n//      throw e;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`AbstractMap` throws a NPE when looking through the entry set for the key, when the entry set contains null.\r\n\r\nWithout this, this test still throws a NPE:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testContainsKeyWithNullEntry() {\r\n    Map<String, Boolean> actual = new NullEntryMap();\r\n\r\n    AssertionError error = catchThrowableOfType(() -> assertThat(actual).containsKey(\"notPresent\"), AssertionError.class);\r\n    assertThat(error).hasMessageContaining(\"null\");\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut even with this change, this test fails (with the key \"present\" hard coded to be in the entry set):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testDoesNotConainKeyWithNullEntry() {\r\n    Map<String, Boolean> actual = new NullEntryMap();\r\n\r\n    AssertionError error = catchThrowableOfType(() -> assertThat(actual).doesNotContainKey(\"present\"), AssertionError.class);\r\n    assertThat(error).hasMessageContaining(\"null\");\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat key is actually in the entry set, but entry sets containing null entries are now basically the same as empty entry sets, so this one fails because no `AssertionError` gets thrown.\r\n\r\nGiven that this change seems to be just trying to cover up a bug in the map implementation, I'm thinking that it would be better to leave things as they are now. The way it is now, you'll get a NPE and can go fix your custom map.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1632798953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"etellman","id":4540294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDAyOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4540294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman","html_url":"https://github.com/etellman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1636010625","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/3087#issuecomment-1636010625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3087","id":1636010625,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAIX3Vs5hg4qB","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-14T15:16:34Z","updated_at":"2023-07-14T15:16:34Z","body":"We

probably didn't explain this clearly, but I don't think there should make any change for this. The code as written now seems fine to me.\r\n\r\nIt's plausible that for a particular pair in the entry set, the key and/or value is null. I think these cases are already handled by AssertJ. It isn't plausible for the entry set to contain a null key/value pair, as there isn't anything reasonable that this would mean. If there's a null value in the entry set, the user's map implementation has a bug and they should fix it. \r\n\r\nWhen I created a trivial map implementation with this problem, `containsKey()` threw a NPE. `AbstractMap` assumes that the entry set will never contain a `null` value. A map that extends `AbstractMap` will probably throw NPE from a various places if it has an entry set that contains `null`. We could add a work-around for null values in entry sets in `StandardRepresentation` but the test may get a NPE before AssertJ tries to produce the string representation. \r\n\r\nI thought that instead of changing anything, we should just leave the code as it is now. If the user's map implementation returns entry sets with `null` in them, they'll probably get a NPE from one of the `Map` methods or, if the test makes it that far, from `StandardRepresentation` trying to create a string representation of the map. This is good, because then the user will find out that their map has a problem and can go fix it. \r\n\r\nI definitely wouldn't change the behavior of `containsKey`. That would hide any NPE from a map, converting them all into \"key not present\".\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to have `StandardRepresentation` throw an `IllegalStateException` (or similar) with a helpful error message if there's a `null` entry in the entry set. That might be more useful than masking the issue by adding \"null\" to the string representation of the entry set. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. If you still want to change `StandardRepresentation` to include \"null\" in the string description of the map or throw an exception with a more helpful message, they're both easy changes to make. I was just questioning whether either was the right thing to do.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1636243334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"etellman","id":4540294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDAyOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4540294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman","html_url":"https://github.com/etellman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9830194367,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs5pAbpIzwAAAAJJ7Ny_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/9830194367","actor":{"login":"etellman","id":4540294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDAyOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4540294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman","html_url":"https://github.com/etellman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a58ac8759d24ac8a753f0f67019721751acbe14c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etellman/assertj/commits/a58ac8759d24ac8a753f0f67019721751acbe14c","created_at":"2023-07-16T01:21:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"etellman","id":4540294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDAyOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4540294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman","html_url":"https://github.com/etellman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-16T01:22:52Z","updated_at":"2023-07-16T01:22:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3110","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3110/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3110/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3110/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj/pull/3110","id":1806391045,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAIX3Vs5VmWnC","number":3110,"title":"Handle

string.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/1636941125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"etellman","id":4540294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDAyOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4540294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman","html_url":"https://github.com/etellman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etellman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9831420614,"node_id":"CE_lADOAIX3Vs5pAbpIzwAAAAJJ_5LG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/9831420614","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"776b46c514c4336c58a643fb08bf61a1ac6cb9b3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/commits/776b46c514c4336c58a643fb08bf61a1ac6cb9b3","created_at":"2023-07-16T16:31:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11610444940,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIX3Vs5pAbpIzwAAAAK0CVSM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/11610444940","actor":{"login":"schlosna","id":54594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna","html_url":"https://github.com/schlosna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schlosna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"776b46c514c4336c58a643fb08bf61a1ac6cb9b3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schlosna/assertj-core/commits/776b46c514c4336c58a643fb08bf61a1ac6cb9b3","created_at":"2024-01-26T15:57:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14496723035,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAIX3Vs5pAbpIzwAAAANgEnBb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/events/14496723035","actor":{"login":"scordio","id":26772046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzcyMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26772046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio","html_url":"https://github.com/scordio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scordio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users
