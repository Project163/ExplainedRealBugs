The supplier is called only if an error occurs, otherwise it is not called.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        Assertions.assertTrue(true, () -> \"I won't be called\");\r\n        Assertions.assertTrue(false, () -> \"I will be called\");\r\n```\r\nIt is useful for at least two reason : \r\n\r\n- performance optimization if computing the custom error message is costly.\r\n- getting error message may not be possible if there is not an error, however assertThat try to get the error message even if there is no error.\r\n\r\nSuggestion, add the same capability to withFailMEssage or overridingErrorMessage, example : \r\n\r\n```java\r\n        assertThat(response.isError())\r\n            .withFailMessage(() -> \"my error\")\r\n            .isFalse();\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1837/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1837/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
