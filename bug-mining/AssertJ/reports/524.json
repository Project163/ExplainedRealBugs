Feature summary\r\n\r\nAs discussed in [another issue](https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2517#issuecomment-1788856623), here is the suggestion to support being able to ignore certain exceptions when not expecting exceptions.\r\n\r\nIt would be similar to what can be done with the [Selenium API](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/FluentWait.html):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   // Waiting 30 seconds for an element to be present on the page, checking\r\n   // for its presence once every 5 seconds.\r\n   Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<WebDriver>(driver)\r\n       .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30L))\r\n       .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5L))\r\n       .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nThat is how it can look in AssertJ:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThatCode(() -> { thisFunctionDoesNothing(); })\r\n                .doesNotThrowAnyExceptionExcept(NoSuchElementException.class, IOException.class);\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/3248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
