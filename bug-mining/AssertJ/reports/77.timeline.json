That should be done in a separate method that can be reused in other fields comparison assertions.\n\nBTW, showing what you changed is nice, but a PR is even nicer ;-)

this change broke a few of our tests because we were using it in a common test method where we compare similar objects with different properties (hard to explain). In one of the classes we need to ignore a specific field which isn't included in the other similar classes. Since we don't want to copy-paste this common method all around (some might disagree) we added the ignored field name into this common method.\n\nI've just explained this as an example that was lacking in this issue, not as a complaint :). I think it'd be good to be able to skip this verification.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/comments/77885344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"natnan","id":5628051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjgwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5628051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan","html_url":"https://github.com/natnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
