**assertThat(list/iterable)** while already having method **isIn** could be extened with method **isOnlyValueIn** and there is few methods of this kind, so it wont be bloated.\r\n\r\nMy testcase again: i have selenium web test in which:\r\ni have web form on which you select records/rows to perform some operation say **publish**.\r\n**1. select some rows - say (1, 2, 4)**\r\n**2. perform publish**\r\n**3. use function which returns List of statuses of ALL rows.**\r\n**4. check that rows (1,2,4) has status (publish/green) etc.** (dont care about other rows)\r\n\r\nSo i like to make assert for that as shortest possible and oneliner.\r\nOf course i can somehow get data of rows and afterwards supply this to assert\r\nI just want to shift that work (segmenting, getting value) to
