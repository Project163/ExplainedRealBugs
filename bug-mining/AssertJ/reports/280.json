However, there are a number of other packages that are dynamically accessed by AssertJ at run time using `Class.forName()`. Bnd is not able to automatically determine these references and so they must be explicitly specified in the Import-Package Bnd instruction.\r\n\r\nThe specific example I ran into was with Assumptions - which sequentially tries to load the assumption classes of JUnit, OpenTest4J and TestNG (in that order). In an OSGi environment, these load attempts will fail unless they are (optionally) imported by the bundle. This issue will only trigger if an assumption fails (as the assumptions only lazily try to load the assumption exception class).\r\n\r\nThe fix is fairly straightforward, and I have already tested this in my local directory. I hope to submit a PR with the fix shortly.\r\n\r\nThis and a few other recent OSGi-related bugs that have come up recently (eg, #1250, #1160 and #1181) also perhaps highlights that it would be nice for some kind of integration test in the continuous build process that exercises the OSGi aspects of the implementation.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
