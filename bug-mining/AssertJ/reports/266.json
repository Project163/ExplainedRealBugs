Summary\r\n\r\nAssertions on implementations of `SortedSet` (like `TreeSet`) do not use the comparator used to construct the instance.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to create a class that returned a set of strings which allowed testing for case-insensitive inclusion, I'd use a `TreeSet` with a custom comparator. The following code example is greatly simplified, but demonstrates the basic mechanics (in a real example, the creation of the set would be encapsulated within the class under test).\r\n\r\n```java\r\nTreeSet<String> mySet = new TreeSet<>(Comparator.comparing(String::toUpperCase));\r\nmySet.add(\"FOO\");\r\nassertThat(mySet.contains(\"foo\")).isTrue(); // passes\r\nassertThat(mySet).contains(\"foo\"); // fails\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found it surprising that the assertion didn't really call `mySet.contains()`, but looking into the AssertJ codebase I found that it was highly abstracted.\r\n\r\nI can work around it by passing in an element comparator, like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(mySet).usingElementComparator(mySet.comparator()).contains(\"foo\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in a real application, the set would probably have come from a method just returning `Set<String>`, so accessing its comparator is mostly out of the question. And even if I did, it just wouldn't feel like I was actually testing that my class returned a case-insensitive set.","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
