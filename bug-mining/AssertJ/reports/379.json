Summary\r\n\r\nThe first implementation of field by field comparison were not recursive which had limited usage, they should be replaced by recursive comparison. \r\n\r\nThe javadoc should show how to migrate from the deprecated comparison to the recursive one (although 100% equivalence might not always be achievable).\r\n\r\nAfter a few versions, we will remove the deprecated code which is bit complex to maintain and has polluted the
