Summary\r\n    \r\n`assertThat(a).usingComparator(c).isEqualTo(b)` does not ask `c` if one of `a` or `b` is `null`. That itself is ok, but it must be mentioned in the documentation.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n\r\n    @Given(\"\"\"^the data element is \"([^\"]*)\"${'$'}\"\"\")\r\n    fun `the data element is `(arg: String) {\r\n        assertThat(rmessage!!.data?.elment)\r\n                .usingComparator(blankOkComperator).isEqualTo(arg)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    object blankOkComperator : Comparator<String> {\r\n        override fun compare(o1: String?, o2: String?): Int {\r\n            if(StringUtils.isBlank(o1) && StringUtils.isBlank(o2)) return 0\r\n            if(StringUtils.isBlank(o1)) return -1\r\n            if(StringUtils.isBlank(o2)) return 1\r\n            return o1!!.compareTo(o2!!)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `arg` is `\"\"` -- which happens with Cucumber Examples -- then I would like that to be compared equal with `null`.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentionied in the documentation that `usingCompartor` is not suitable for that\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in an internal function, but it should be visible at the interface level.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  /**\r\n   * Returns true if actual and other are equal according to {@link #comparator}, false otherwise.<br>\r\n   * Handles the cases where one of the parameter is null so that internal {@link #comparator} does not have too.\r\n   * \r\n   * @param actual the object to compare to
