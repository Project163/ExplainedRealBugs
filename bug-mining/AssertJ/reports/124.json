It returns an array of objects instead.\n\nHere is some test code to reproduce the issue:\n\n``` java\n  @Test\n  public void should_return_array_of_given_iterable_type() throws Exception {\n    ArrayList<CharSequence> values = new ArrayList<>();\n    values.add(\"one\"); values.add(\"two\");\n\n    CharSequence[] result = Iterables.toArray(values);\n  }\n```\n\nFails with:\n`java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.CharSequence;`\n\nI debugged several `toArray` calls and it always returns `Object[]`.\n\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nI furthermore noticed that the `Iterables` class is marked to be removed? Just curious because I am working on a contribution for #393 where this util class would be nice to have :-) \n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
