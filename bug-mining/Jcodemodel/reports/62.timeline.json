I started by only caching the classes, for a deep copying recursive issue (what if a field refer to the class being copied ?) . But then I realized another issue.\r\n\r\nBasically we want two things for the copying from a SRC model to a CP model: \r\n\r\n1. once copied, no modification applied to SRC will impact CP, and reciprocally. eg renaming a variable, a method, deleting, creating. NO change at all.\r\n2. once copied, any modification applied to CP will have the same exact result as when applied to SRC, and reciprocally.\r\n\r\nThe first part implies to copy everything, even the JAtom.\r\nThe second part implies that the model\"tree\" is exactly the same, so if a node is present at two places, then its copy must also be present at two places. The only way to do that is to cache the nodes being copied. Since there will be deep copy that can produce recursion issue, the caching of a an IJObject copy must be done in a very strict way, that is always create a shallow copy, before storing it, then deep copy it so that the deep copy can reference it.
