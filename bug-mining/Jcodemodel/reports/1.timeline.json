It is checked into the \"util\" package.\n\nExample for a class with base class Object:\n\n``` java\n@Override\n public int hashCode ()\n {\n   return new HashCodeGenerator (this).append (member1).append (member2).getHashCode ();\n }\n```\n\nExample for a class which is derived from a class different than Object:\n\n``` java\n@Override\n public int hashCode ()\n {\n   return HashCodeGenerator.getDerived (super.hashCode ()).append (member3).append (member4).getHashCode ();\n }\n```\n\nConcerning equals, I don't have a real helper because there are four different versions of equals required, depending on the scope of the class:\n1. class is not final and it's base class is Object\n2. class is final and it's base class is Object\n3. class who's base class is NOT Object\n\nHere are the examples for all cases:\n\n``` java\npublic class Case1 {\n  private String s;\n  private int i;\n  public boolean equals (Object o) {\n    // always the first clause\n    if (o == this)\n     return true;\n    // Parameter is null or from a different implementation class\n    if (o == null || !getClass ().equals (o.getClass ()))\n      return false;\n    // Same class and parameter not null - start comparing\n    Case1 rhs = (Case1) o;\n    return EqualsUtils.equals (s, rhs.s) && EqualsUtils.equals(i, rhs.i);\n  }\n}\npublic final class Case2 {\n  String s;\n  int i;\n  public boolean equals (Object o) {\n    // always the first clause\n    if (o == this)\n     return true;\n    // Parameter is null or from a different implementation class\n    // Theoretically the line from Case1 could also be used here, but I think this is more readable\n    if (!(o instanceof Case2))\n      return false;\n    // Same class and parameter not null - start comparing\n    Case2 rhs = (Case2) o;\n    return EqualsUtils.equals (s, rhs.s) && EqualsUtils.equals(i, rhs.i);\n  }\n}\npublic class Case3 extends Case1 {\n  private int x;\n  public boolean equals (Object o) {\n    // always the first clause\n    if (o == this)\n     return true;\n    // Parameter is null or from a different implementation class\n    if (!super.equals (o))\n      return false;\n    // Same class and parameter not null - start comparing\n    Case3 rhs = (Case3) o;\n    return EqualsUtils.equals (s, rhs.s) && EqualsUtils.equals(i, rhs.i);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo it can be drilled down to Case1 and Case3 if you want.\nBtw. EqualsUtils is a small utility class in the util package, that performs null-safe-equals.\n\nDo you think this is reasonable?\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/comments/56160938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"phax","id":196219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax","html_url":"https://github.com/phax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/comments/56258119","html_url":"https://github.com/phax/jcodemodel/issues/20#issuecomment-56258119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/20","id":56258119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjU4MTE5","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-20T06:06:15Z","updated_at":"2014-09-20T06:06:15Z","body":"`equals` static methods would better have a different name, not colliding with `Object.equals()` to allow static import.\n\nCould you also provide a method accepting varargs  to compute hashCode?
