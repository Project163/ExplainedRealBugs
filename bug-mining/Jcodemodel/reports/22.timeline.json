was looking into it and I'm not quite sure what the best way is.\nWe already have a `JDocComment javaDoc()` method for classes, enum constants, field vars, methods and packages.\n\nBut this class will always create multi line comments like\n\n``` java\n    /**\n     * Description\n     *\n     * @param any\n     *     Input value\n     * @return\n     *     Input value plus \"X\".\n     * @throws
