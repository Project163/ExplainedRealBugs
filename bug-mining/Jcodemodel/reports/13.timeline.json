I can't change the package name since it's tied to the company domain (indonesian domains have the ccTLD .id).\n\nSince AA imports R.id, R.layout, etc, why doesn't it import R.menu as well, which would solve this? Either that or don't import anything and just use the fully qualified name (it's generated code anyway).\n\nI'm using version 3.2.

I guess it thinks (correctly), that R.id is a top-level class. However, in your example, it does know that, but it still generates a bad code:\n\n``` java\npublic class HelloAndroidActivity_ {\n\n    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu() {\n        menuInflater.inflate(myMenu);\n    }\n\n    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected() {\n        if (itemId_ == myItem) {\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI could not reproduce my exact problem with modifying your test case.\nBut i created an simple case in the AndroidAnnotations test suite, which reproduces the issue. If i publish that, you can debug into it and access the codemodel object, and you can easily debug through the generation. Is that OK for you?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/comments/140117166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WonderCsabo","id":480485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDQ4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/480485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo","html_url":"https://github.com/WonderCsabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/comments/140119986","html_url":"https://github.com/phax/jcodemodel/issues/30#issuecomment-140119986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/30","id":140119986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDExOTk4Ng==","user":{"login":"phax","id":196219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax","html_url":"https://github.com/phax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-14T15:42:36Z","updated_at":"2015-09-14T15:42:36Z","body":"Sounds
