The previous behavior was adding a block with no indent and no braces.\n\nIn [AndroidAnnotations](https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations), we are using the old behavior extensively: we create no-indent no-braces blocks as placeholders, so we can easily insert code in the desired order later. To achieve this now, we have to create the blocks in the following way:\n\n``` java\nJBlock block = body.block().bracesRequired(false).indentRequired(false);\n```\n\nIt would be nice if the API would provide a much shorter convenience method, for example:\n\n``` java\nJBlock block = body.block(false, false);\n```\n\nOr maybe this, too:\n\n``` java\nJBlock block = body.blockWithoutBraces(); // with a better method name :)\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"phax","id":196219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax","html_url":"https://github.com/phax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
