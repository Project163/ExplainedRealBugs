some cases, the convention for a certain class is to never be imported, but always use its fully qualified class name when referencing it or any of its members. In the Android world, such a class is the `android.R` class, which contains resource identifiers for the system, and it should not be confused with the project `R` class which gets imported. For example:\r\n```java\r\npackage example.my.project;\r\n\r\npublic class MyActivity extends Activity {\r\n\r\n  void someMethod() {\r\n    String system = getString(android.R.string.some_string);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt would be nice to add an option to JCodeModel to support this.","closed_by":{"login":"phax","id":196219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax","html_url":"https://github.com/phax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/51/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/51/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
