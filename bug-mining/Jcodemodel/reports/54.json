Also the JCodemodel should have a Map of JResourceDirectory, by name.\r\n4. add JPackage to JResourceDir translation, typically with ` public JResourceDir JPackage::asResourceDir(){return m_aOwner.getResourceDir(m_sName);}`\r\n5. add again addResourceFile in JPackage , but calling corresponding resource dir \r\n`public AbstractJResourceFile JPackage::addResourceFile (@Nonnull final AbstractJResourceFile rsrc){return asResourceDir().addResourceFile(rsrc);}` ; and same for the other methods.\r\n\r\nPossibly you can make JPackage extend JResourceDir. Still, overload the methods to call the resource dir when creating resources.","closed_by":{"login":"phax","id":196219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax","html_url":"https://github.com/phax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
