These kind of things should be created by factory methods.\n2. This will do the trick of course. However i still think the most clear way would be introducing an `enumConstantRef` method, which would return a `JEnumConstant` or `JEnumConstantRef` instance. I know that from perspective of the final generated source, the enum constant ref is just the same as a static field ref, but it would be still nicer in the API, more expressive.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/comments/140061917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WonderCsabo","id":480485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDQ4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/480485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo","html_url":"https://github.com/WonderCsabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WonderCsabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":408623631,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQwODYyMzYzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/events/408623631","actor":{"login":"phax","id":196219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax","html_url":"https://github.com/phax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e6445c1f4d370c1151a92691d6b61f9f1ee8d808","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/commits/e6445c1f4d370c1151a92691d6b61f9f1ee8d808","created_at":"2015-09-14T13:02:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/comments/140064548","html_url":"https://github.com/phax/jcodemodel/issues/28#issuecomment-140064548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/28","id":140064548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDA2NDU0OA==","user":{"login":"phax","id":196219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax","html_url":"https://github.com/phax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-14T13:03:27Z","updated_at":"2015-09-14T13:03:27Z","body":"`JExpr.enumConstant (JDefinedClass, String)` is now in the trunk.
