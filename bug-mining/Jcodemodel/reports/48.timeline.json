That is, nothing in the java language prevents from creating my.pck.Object .\r\nThe issue is that ATM if I create an Object class and I refer to java.lang.Object inside it, JCodeModel will translate it into \"Object\" (ignoring the java.lang package) because this package is already imported, but the java compiler will translate this \"Object\" into \"my.pck.Object\", because that's what the Object class refer to in this context.\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution would be to ensure the java.lang package is not removed when the class refereed  to has the same name as a class declared in the current class or its subclasses. \r\n\r\nexample if I want to create \r\n\r\n```\r\nMyClass{\r\n\r\npublic static class Object{}\r\n\r\npublic java.lang.Object get(){ return null;}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing JCodemodel, I can't, because JCodemodel will translate to `public Object get()` which the java compiler will translate to `public MyClass.Object get()`\r\n\r\nEnsuring the JCodemodel does not do it may require a lot of additional modifications, so in a first and simpler pass I advise to allow the user to specifically prevent the usage of a class name that is already present in java.lang.\r\n\r\nI think you misunderstood the part \"reaction\" that I wrote. I specifically wrote that throwing an exception (or returning false) is a bad behaviour unless specifically required by the user. The optimal solution is to make JCodeModel refer to not remove the java.lang. prefix when the class name is overriden by a local class.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/comments/539552957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glelouet","id":3405335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDUzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3405335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet","html_url":"https://github.com/glelouet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/comments/539553396","html_url":"https://github.com/phax/jcodemodel/issues/71#issuecomment-539553396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/71","id":539553396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTU1MzM5Ng==","user":{"login":"glelouet","id":3405335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDUzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3405335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet","html_url":"https://github.com/glelouet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glelouet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-08T14:56:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T14:56:33Z","body":"I
