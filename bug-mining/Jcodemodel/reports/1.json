What way of implementing this do you prefer for the lib? Some particular auto generation utility, such as from Apache Commons, or Lombok, or Google's auto-value? Generating from Eclipse/Intellij? Or writing by hand?\n\n(Of cause I would be very grateful if you implement this, but if don't want to, I will be forced to do it myself, and will try to accout your advice.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"phax","id":196219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax","html_url":"https://github.com/phax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
