creating a class, called Outer, and an inner class inside it, called Inner.\r\n\r\nI'm then using the inner class as a generic parameter of an anonymous class in another class in the same package.\r\n\r\nThe result is that in the generic parameter the inner class is written unqualified and not imported, resulting in a compile error.\r\n\r\nHere is an example code\r\n```java\r\n        JCodeModel cm = new JCodeModel();\r\n\r\n        JDefinedClass outerClass = cm._class(\"test.Outer\");\r\n        JDefinedClass innerClass = outerClass._class(\"Inner\");\r\n\r\n        JDefinedClass

cm.ref(List.class).narrow(innerClass), \"field\", JExpr._new(anonymousClass));\r\n```\r\nAnd this is the result\r\n```java\r\npackage test;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\n\r\npublic class Test {\r\n    List<Outer.Inner> field = new List<Inner>() {\r\n    }\r\n    ;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe declaration `List<Outer.Inner> field` is correct, but the instantiation `new List<Inner>` is not.","closed_by":{"login":"phax","id":196219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax","html_url":"https://github.com/phax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
