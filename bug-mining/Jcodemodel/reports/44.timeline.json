Keywords\r\n\r\nsee #70 for the keywords \r\n\r\n# java.lang\r\n\r\n## Issue \r\n\r\nThis is an issue because this package is already imported and as such not referenced to.\r\n\r\nTypically if I create a my.package.Object class and then I create a method \r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    boolean equals(java.lang.Object other) \r\n\r\nThe object other actually refers to the class I am crating, and not the java.lang.Object class.\r\nThis issue literally happened to me when compiling against a openapi web service that produces \"Object\" responses.\r\n\r\n## Detection\r\n\r\nThis issue is very complicated : since the java reflection works bottom-up, that is the classes know their package but the package doesn't know its classes, it's difficult to find if the class exists without a java.lang.class.forName(\"java.lang.\"+sName), with trycatch around. This expensive call requires to cache the result in a hasmap<String, Boolean>\r\n\r\nhere is my code\r\n\r\n\tprivate static final HashMap<String, Boolean> resolvedJavaLangNames = new HashMap<>();\r\n\t\r\n         /**\r\n\t * check if a name already represents a class in the java.lang package. eg\r\n\t * String should return true, but LeetH4X0R should not.\r\n\t * \r\n\t * @param className\r\n\t *          name to test\r\n\t * @return the existence of such a class in the java.lang (cached)\r\n\t */\r\n\tpublic static boolean isJavaLangClass(String className) {\r\n\t\tif (resolvedJavaLangNames.containsKey(className)) {\r\n\t\t\treturn resolvedJavaLangNames.get(className);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tboolean isJavaLang = true;\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tClass.forName(\"java.lang.\" + className);\r\n\t\t} catch (Exception e) {\r\n\t\t\tisJavaLang = false;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tresolvedJavaLangNames.put(className, isJavaLang);\r\n\t\treturn isJavaLang;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nLooking at how fast it is to use JCodeModel, I consider the use of synchronization to be worthless (I usually don't and thus would have synced over the hashmap in the method)\r\n\r\nIt should check for specific exception (security exception means I can't tell)\r\n\r\n## Reaction\r\n\r\nIn the case the class C is in java.lang already, two possibilities : \r\n- internally mark the class C as javaLangMisleading, so that all call to a java.lang.C are specifically written as such\r\n- throw an exception (bad - unless in the option)\r\n\r\nIMO both should be available. mark the class C as misleading , AND allow users to avoid this with a compilation option.\r\n\r\nEspecially, I'm not sure how to make the misleading part, since the writing of the class names may be done without the knowledge of where that name is used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/71/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/71/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/comments/536192565","html_url":"https://github.com/phax/jcodemodel/issues/70#issuecomment-536192565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phax/jcodemodel/issues/70","id":536192565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjE5MjU2NQ==","user":{"login":"guiguilechat","id":26408407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDA4NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26408407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat","html_url":"https://github.com/guiguilechat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiguilechat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-28T14:01:57Z","updated_at":"2019-09-28T14:01:57Z","body":"Just saying, this is actually an issue because it generates invalid java code.\r\nWhich is then much harder to debug.

me tell you, sir, about our lord and savior maven.\r\n\r\n# Release plugin\r\n\r\nI would advise you to use the maven release module\r\n\r\n`mvn clean release:prepare release:perform `\r\n\r\nwhich automatically changes the versions, while still working on the snapshot .\r\n\r\nHowever there are a few issues, eg it may break because compilation phases have non-deterministic effect (don't use the mvn clean in that case : instead make two separate calls `mvn clean install && mvn release:prepare release:perform ` .\r\n\r\nOther issues is that you may crash and add a tag in local and remote that will later prevent you from actually updating the value to the next version. In that case, delete the tag from local and remote repository with eg `mvn release:rollback; git tag -d 1.2.3 && git push --delete origin 1.2.3` if you were at the version 1.2.3-SNAPSHOT before release and you asked to release the 1.2.3 when it failed.\r\n\r\nYou also need to set your csm to a correct value.
