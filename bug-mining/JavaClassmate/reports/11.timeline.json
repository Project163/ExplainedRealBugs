I attached below a snippet with a code that reproduces it. If you run the code, the output is:\n\n```\nK<java.lang.Integer>\n\nLjava/lang/Integer; Ljava/lang/String<Ljava/lang/Integer;>; Ljava/util/List<Ljava/lang/Integer;>; Ljava/util/Map<Ljava/lang/String;LClazz;>; \n```\n\nwhich is not correct.\n\nThe ' Ljava/lang/String<Ljava/lang/Integer;>;' is wrong since String is not parametrised. \n\nAs I can see, TypeResolver#_constructType calls for:\n\n```\nreturn new ResolvedObjectType(rawType, typeBindings,\n            _resolveSuperClass(context, rawType, typeBindings),\n            _resolveSuperInterfaces(context, rawType, typeBindings));\n```\n\nwhere super constructor is called:\n\n```\nprotected ResolvedType(Class<?> cls, TypeBindings bindings)\n    {\n        _erasedType = cls;\n        _typeBindings = (bindings == null) ? TypeBindings.emptyBindings() : bindings;\n    }\n```\n\nbut there is no check whether the type is parametrised or so.\nVersion: 1.1.0\n\nMany thanks\n\nThe snippet:\n\n```\nimport com.fasterxml.classmate.MemberResolver;\nimport com.fasterxml.classmate.ResolvedType;\nimport com.fasterxml.classmate.ResolvedTypeWithMembers;\nimport com.fasterxml.classmate.TypeResolver;\nimport com.fasterxml.classmate.members.ResolvedMethod;\n\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class Clazz<T extends Number> {\n\n    public void method(K<T> arg0) {\n    }\n}\n\nclass K<Z> {\n    public void method(Z arg0, String arg1, List<Z> arg2, Map<String, Clazz<Integer>> arg3) {\n    }\n}\n\nclass Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        TypeResolver typeResolver = new TypeResolver();\n        ResolvedType resolvedClazz = typeResolver.resolve(Clazz.class, Integer.class);\n        MemberResolver clazzMemberResolver = new MemberResolver(typeResolver);\n        ResolvedTypeWithMembers resolvedClazzMembersTypes = clazzMemberResolver.resolve(resolvedClazz, null, null);\n\n        for (ResolvedMethod resolvedClazzMethod : resolvedClazzMembersTypes.getMemberMethods()) {\n            for (int i = 0;

There may be multiple things going on here, but here are my two suspicions:\n- The Integer type should be a primitive but the ClassKey that is built for Integer.class is not matching on [line 339](https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/classmate/TypeResolver.java#L339)\n- The type construction is incorrectly associating the type bindings to the Integer type (resulting in an Integer with a parameterized type) on [line 368](https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/classmate/TypeResolver.java#L368)\n\n(accidentally pasted in the wrong test before. edited with correct test that also uses static inner class and tests both for primitive and \"ghost\" parameters)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-07T17:00:05Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T17:00:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/35","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/35/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/35/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/35/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/35","id":181499219,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODE0OTkyMTk=","number":35,"title":"MemberResolver
