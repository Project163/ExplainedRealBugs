This means that in ever single usage like the above, I will need to suppress a warning related to the lack of a `serialVersionUID`.\r\n\r\n* The original example in Neil Gafter's famous [_Super Type Tokens_](https://gafter.blogspot.com/2006/12/super-type-tokens.html) does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* Jackson's `TypeReference` does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* Spring's [`ParameterizedTypeReference`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/ParameterizedTypeReference.html) does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* The Guice [`TypeLiteral`](https://google.github.io/guice/api-docs/7.0.0/javadoc/com/google/inject/TypeLiteral.html) does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* The [GeantyRef](https://github.com/leangen/geantyref) fork of [gentyref](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gentyref/) has a [`TypeToken`](https://github.com/leangen/geantyref/blob/master/src/main/java/io/leangen/geantyref/TypeToken.java) which does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* Guava's [`TypeToken`](https://guava.dev/releases/snapshot-jre/api/docs/com/google/common/reflect/TypeToken.html) unfortunately does implement `Serializable`, so at least ClassMate is not alone on this.\r\n\r\nSo only ClassMate and Guava implement `Serializable` for the class with identical functionality. The rest don't. It's not clear to me how it would ever be useful.\r\n\r\nCan we remove `implements Serializable` from ClassMate `GenericType<T>`? No one needs or even wants `Serializable` in 2023. There are few if any cases that anyone should be creating new code using `Serializable`, and here it just brings a headache.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/73/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/73/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
