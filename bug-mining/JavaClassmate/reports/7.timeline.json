I am not aware of any bugs it has. The only concern I have is whether JAX-RS specification itself can use it. But if they can use interface type(s) needed to define methods to implement (from JAX-RS perspective), I'm sure ClassMate could be changed to implement that (or simple ClassMate wrapper project that does that).\n\nAs to Jackson: I can make this happen for 2.2, but as with all API changes, it can't go in 2.1. But I don't think JAX-RS specification itself cares too much. And if necessary, it is possible to make sure 2.2 gets released early enough to work with Jersey, and Jersey release candidates can use 2.2.0-SNAPSHOT in the meantime.\n\nOne thing I am still unsure about, however, is just this: while we can make anything implement `java.lang.reflect.Type`, it does not solve the bigger problem: how to avoid close coupling between libraries? Jackson does not know ClassMate; nor do I want to add a dependency from the core. Same for ClassMate (in reverse direction).\nMy plan for using ClassMate from Jackson was to use Maven Shade plug-in, which basically creates a private copy; and its types would not be usable outside of Jackson (or vice versa).\n\nAbove might not be a problem, if all that is needed is ability to pass `JavaType` from client side, and then Jackson can typecast is just fine. I am just trying to figure out how ClassMate would fit in here, as external library.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/10525153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/10525190","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/11#issuecomment-10525190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/11","id":10525190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTI1MTkw","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-11-19T18:38:27Z","updated_at":"2012-11-19T18:38:27Z","body":"One more thing: I am not on any JAX-RS spec list.

My guess is that Jersey client simply takes the `java.lang.reflect.Type`, and passes that to Jackson. This is fine, since I think that is the whole point of the type (ability to \"wrap\" generic type, to retain it despite type erasure).\n\nI did understand the suggestion on wholesale replacement: and you are right in that this would be possible for 3.0.\nBut even there the question is whether benefits exceed the cost. It is a big change, and users do not generally like such changes.\n\nTimeline for 3.0 would also be quite a bit out in the future. Users do not exactly like major updates, and there must be some significant benefits to reap to do those. So question, then, is whether to wait out for that, or try to work in making use of actual functionality that ClassMate uses.\n\nAt the same time, if ClassMate will get adopted widely, one could definitely argue that there are benefits from Jackson also adopting it.

I re-read the Javadoc for `TypeBindings` multiple times and I still don't understand what it's for. It doesn't seem to hold any state, so why do you need to pass it in as an argument?\n2. Why do you need to reverse the parameter order? `TypeBindings` does not implement `Type``so how could it conflict with the``Type...`` vararg?\n3. The new `TypeResolver` is much cleaner. Good job! Question: Why do we need arrayType? Couldn't users simply invoke `TypeResolver.resolve(int[].class)`?\n4. I believe you could improve usability by moving `TypeResolver.resolveSubType()` and `TypeResolver.isSelfReference()` to the `ResolvedType` class. The factory class should only be used to construct the initial `ResolvedType`.\n5. The `ResolvedType` Javadoc looks extremely \"busy\". Consider converting some of the protected methods to package-private (I believe this will remove them from the Javadoc and hide them in IDEs). As usual, document all methods and consider adding examples to some of the descriptions. For example, it's not obvious what http://cowtowncoder.github.com/java-classmate/javadoc/0.8.0/com/fasterxml/classmate/ResolvedType.html#typeParametersFor(java.lang.Class) means. If the documentation provided an example it would probably be easier to understand.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/10586350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowwoc","id":633348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzM0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc","html_url":"https://github.com/cowwoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/10586625","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/11#issuecomment-10586625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/11","id":10586625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTg2NjI1","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-11-21T06:08:05Z","updated_at":"2012-11-21T06:08:05Z","body":"1. TypeBindings is needed for resolving bound type variables, and it does indeed have state (passed via 'create' factory method). It mostly makes sense for recursive resolution, and less commonly from main method. And it is extensively used when resolving members (ResolvedType itself keeps track of it). But I don't think method(s) in `TypeResolver` that take it are commonly used outside of ClassMate code.\n2. For method calls that pass nulls (unit tests had some), and perhaps for auto-completion. While not absolutely required (i.e. it could have been retained), I think change makes sense at this point before finalizing 1.0. Especially since this alternative method is rarely used from outside package itself.\n3. This is for programmatically constructing arrays of types; usually resolved types. Like Map<String,Integer>[] or such. Arrays are odd types; they are not generic, but have actual non-type-erased element type information.\n4. I was wondering about this one; but if so, ResolvedType would need to contain a back-reference to TypeResolver. This is possible, but did not seem quite right. At the same time, I agree in that current call patterns is not optimal either. I am open to change.\n5. I'm sure documentation could be improved. I don't have too much time to spend here, but will keep this in mind. Note that there's a bit of usage documentation on README of the project itself, contributed by @blangel (who also much improved unit tests).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/10586625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":30065429,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAwNjU0Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/events/30065429","actor":{"login":"blangel","id":1139338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzkzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1139338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel","html_url":"https://github.com/blangel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-11-21T06:08:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":30065430,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMDY1NDMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/events/30065430","actor":{"login":"blangel","id":1139338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzkzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1139338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel","html_url":"https://github.com/blangel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blangel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-11-21T06:08:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/10586839","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/11#issuecomment-10586839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/11","id":10586839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTg2ODM5","user":{"login":"cowwoc","id":633348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzM0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc","html_url":"https://github.com/cowwoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-11-21T06:22:15Z","updated_at":"2012-11-21T06:22:15Z","body":"1.
