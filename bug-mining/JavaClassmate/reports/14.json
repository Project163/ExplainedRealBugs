There may be multiple things going on here, but here are my two suspicions:\n- The Integer type should be a primitive but the ClassKey that is built for Integer.class is not matching on [line 339](https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/classmate/TypeResolver.java#L339)\n- The type construction is incorrectly associating the type bindings to the Integer type (resulting in an Integer with a parameterized type) on [line 368](https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/classmate/TypeResolver.java#L368)\n\n(accidentally pasted in the wrong test before. edited with correct test that also uses static inner class and tests both for primitive and \"ghost\" parameters)\n","closed_by":{"login":"web-online","id":8291889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTE4ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8291889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online","html_url":"https://github.com/web-online","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-online/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
