This means that in ever single usage like the above, I will need to suppress a warning related to the lack of a `serialVersionUID`.\r\n\r\n* The original example in Neil Gafter's famous [_Super Type Tokens_](https://gafter.blogspot.com/2006/12/super-type-tokens.html) does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* Jackson's `TypeReference` does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* Spring's [`ParameterizedTypeReference`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/ParameterizedTypeReference.html) does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* The Guice [`TypeLiteral`](https://google.github.io/guice/api-docs/7.0.0/javadoc/com/google/inject/TypeLiteral.html) does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* The [GeantyRef](https://github.com/leangen/geantyref) fork of [gentyref](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gentyref/) has a [`TypeToken`](https://github.com/leangen/geantyref/blob/master/src/main/java/io/leangen/geantyref/TypeToken.java) which does _not_ implement `Serializable`.\r\n* Guava's [`TypeToken`](https://guava.dev/releases/snapshot-jre/api/docs/com/google/common/reflect/TypeToken.html) unfortunately does implement `Serializable`, so at least ClassMate is not alone on this.\r\n\r\nSo only ClassMate and Guava implement `Serializable` for the class with identical functionality. The rest don't. It's not clear to me how it would ever be useful.\r\n\r\nCan we remove `implements Serializable` from ClassMate `GenericType<T>`? No one needs or even wants `Serializable` in 2023.
