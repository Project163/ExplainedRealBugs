I do a simple:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn verify\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.8.1:compile (default-compile) on project classmate: Compilation failure: Compilation failure:\r\n[ERROR] Source option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.\r\n[ERROR] Target option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs v3.8.1 is a pretty old version of the Maven compiler plugin (probably inherited from `com.fasterxml:oss-parent:43`), I would guess that the issue here is my Java 17; it probably doesn't support Java 6—which was released almost 20 years ago!\r\n\r\nJust for \"fun\" I switched to Java 7:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<version.jdk>7</version.jdk>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives me all sorts of new errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestMemberResolver.testAddOverridesFromInterfaces:292 expected:<4> but was:<6>\r\n[ERROR]   TestTypeDescriptions.testSimpleTypes:38 expected:<...va.lang.CharSequence[]> but was:<...va.lang.CharSequence[,java.lang.constant.Constable,java.lang.constant.ConstantDesc]>\r\n[ERROR]   ResolvedObjectTypeTest.testGetStaticFields:81 Expected 3 (JDK 1.6), 4 (1.7/1.8) or 6 (1.9) static fields, got 7; fields: [serialVersionUID, COMPACT_STRINGS, serialPersistentFields, REPL, CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER, LATIN1, UTF16]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm guessing these are unit tests that fail under Java 7 for whatever reason (assuming they weren't failing for you already on Java 6—I have no way to know without (gasp!) downgrading my JDK. 😄).\r\n\r\nBasically the feeling I'm getting is that someone needs to go into the library and just bring it up-to-speed to some modern Java version—update the plugins, fix the unit tests, etc. I could help do that, but only if you say it's OK to move off Java 6. I don't know your feelings about that.\r\n\r\nI know as an open-source library maintainer it's easy to think, \"oh, I don't want to keep anyone from using my library\", and I've had those feelings many times as well. But I think there's a limit and we need to encourage going forward with Java. I would recommend Java 11 at the minimum, but I could work on this if you could at least bear switching to Java 8. I think Java 7 and below would just be too much pain for me without any realistic gain.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
