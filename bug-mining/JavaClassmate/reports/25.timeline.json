I think this was a tricky area, and my immediate thinking is that all array types only really extended `Object`, so that `Long[]` does not have `Number[]` as its super class. I thought (but haven't tested) that this is how casting also works (i.e. does not take into account assignment rules of element type).\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, I think that JDK methods for super class and interfaces should probably be followed, to keep compatibility with that part.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that code, as is, might be taking short-cuts it should not, which could explain the problem. At very least I think `Object` should be available as `getParentClass()`.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe PR for test cases would make sense -- like using JDK accessors to verify some basic aspects?\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/590587191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/590591338","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/51#issuecomment-590591338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/51","id":590591338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDU5MTMzOA==","user":{"login":"ljnelson","id":80764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson","html_url":"https://github.com/ljnelson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljnelson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-24T22:57:02Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T22:57:28Z","body":"Here
