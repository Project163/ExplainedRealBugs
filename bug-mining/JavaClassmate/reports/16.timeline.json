lots of good insight here.

But ability to support different annotation sets (and some other pluggability) seems like a really important thing for me -- both given lack of standardized annotations, and due to there always being some extension sets that libs/frameworks want to define and use.\r\nIt might be worth a look to see Jackson's concept of `AnnotationIntrospector` for ideas; not as specific mechanism to use (it's too low level), but concept of configurable translation.\r\nIt will be necessary to think of how to scope (how extensive would canonical set of supported metadata be? Naming, inclusion/ignoral are easy but beyond that...). And perhaps question of how abstract/concrete should metadata be.\r\n\r\nFrom Jackson side I think progress might be slower due to historical reasons, tight coupling of code. Classmate itself is actually not used by Jackson (alas) -- mostly because Jackson's `JavaType` type hierarchy is exposed as part of API, and is not 1-to-1 mappable with classmate type hierarchy. Internals of Jackson have been rewritten, however, to resemble classmate's processing quite closely (so ClassMate was extracted out of Jackson, and after delay most of improvements were ported back).\r\n\r\nSo it would be great to eventually retrofit Jackson to use possible new library, but that would be a long process and probably not worth making an initial goal. But I do think value of such library has more to do with libs/frameworks other than Jackson actually, similar to value of classmate.\r\n\r\nFinally, question about `getURL` -- turns out this is one known deviation Jackson has from Bean naming. Bean naming only lower cases a single leading capital character (so it'll remain \"URL\"); but I did not know this when I wrote Jackson's handling and Jackson by default considers it to infer property \"url\". There is a setting to change this behavior, to make handling bean-compatible, and for Jackson 3.x this will become the new default.\r\n\r\nDoes above make sense?\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/319864880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/319868725","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/37#issuecomment-319868725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/37","id":319868725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTg2ODcyNQ==","user":{"login":"garretwilson","id":627125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzEyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/627125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/garretwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-03T05:05:17Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T05:05:17Z","body":"@cowtowncoder , first of all, thank you for reading all my thoughts, processing them, and giving a response. And it made my day that you're interested in this effort.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, this is something that I'll wind up doing whether or not anyone cares, because I'm so interested in having the SURF format succeed --- and I absolutely need this functionality for drop-in SURF JAX-RS marshaling. But it will make the whole process much more fun and even exciting if you're \"on board\", at least to the extent that you see the need for such a thing, and that you're watching it with an approving eye.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier incarnation of SURF (long story) I actually wrote this entire marshaling framework simply for storing configuration information (after I had written it for XML, before Java added XML encoding/decoding) for an Internet application framework (another long story). Although the property determination logic was tightly integrated into the pre-SURF version, I called the entire process _PLOOP_ for _Programming Library for Object-Oriented Persistence_ (with the idea that you just \"ploop\" your objects into the configuration files.\r\n\r\nThis new effort to create (from scratch, yet again) a self-contained, format-agnostic project for property access will be a module of PLOOP. Specifically it will live at the Maven coordinates `io.ploop:ploop-pojo`. The work is tracked in JIRA by [PLOOP-12](https://globalmentor.atlassian.net/browse/PLOOP-12), and I've already started the implementation. I intend to finish the initial core functionality this week, because @magnonasc is waiting on it to create the `io.urf:surf-jaxrs` SURF marshaling implementation, tracked by [URF-32](https://globalmentor.atlassian.net/browse/URF-32).\r\n\r\nThe first pass will simply determine which properties to use from available getter/setter methods and public properties --- no annotations for the meantime. Later I'll add annotations for, say, indicating that a private property should be used for reading and/or writing; for ignoring properties; for changing property names; etc. Your experience will be really helpful in finding the direct path to go down. In the short term, however, I'll just be figuring out how to use ClassMate. (I could just pull out and repurpose my existing code if I wanted to use plain reflection, but I figure I should start with ClassMate from the beginning.)\r\n\r\nThe slight inconvenience (to you) is that all these projects of GlobalMentor, Inc. (my company) are managed via Bitbucket/JIRA, not Github. I would love to have your input, and I will doubtlessly have many questions not only about how to use ClassMate, but also to draw on your experience with Jackson on how best proceed in some areas. I would happily add you to our PLOOP JIRA project so that you could comment directly, or if you prefer I could file questions here on the ClassMate GitHub project for you to answer. I'm assuming that your contributing code to the project is too much to ask for, at least for the moment, but that would certainly be welcome if some day you'd like to.\r\n\r\nLet me know how best to let you participate.

The official name of the larger project is now _Programming Library for Object-Oriented Persistence_ ([**Ploop**](https://ploop.io/)), although note that this user-facing site is not yet live. The sub-project specifically for object reflection (built on top of ClassMate), property discovery, property access, and reflective object creation is `ploop-introspection`. The code is now live on Bitbucket at https://bitbucket.org/globalmentor/ploop-introspection . The initial release is tracked by the JIRA issue [PLOOP-12](https://globalmentor.atlassian.net/browse/PLOOP-12).\r\n\r\nThe first task is merely to read JavaBean methods, which is tracked by [PLOOP-13](https://globalmentor.atlassian.net/browse/PLOOP-13). If you pull up that JIRA ticket, you'll see under \"Development\" that there is already a branch with the initial implementation basically finished. I haven't tested a single line of code, though, so I need to create test classes and unit tests before creating a pull request. Hopefully I'll get to that in the next day or two.\r\n\r\n@cowtowncoder , If you would like to be a code reviewer on these upcoming pull requests (and I would be honored), **please let me know your Bitbucket username** so I can provide you with the appropriate permissions. Being a code reviewer doesn't mean you need to actually add any comments if you're busy, but you will be notified of new pull requests and be able to add comments if you wish. (If you really get enthusiastic, of course you can create branches and pull requests too, if you wish.)\r\n\r\n(If you want to be able to file, modify, and comment on JIRA tickets, I'll have to add you to the JIRA project manually. For that I'll need the email address you prefer to use for the GlobalMentor JIRA account. If you wish you can send me this information via email; you can find my email address by searching online for my resume. But this doesn't have to be done now; you can still participate in the pull requests separately as explained above.)\r\n\r\nJust as important going forward will be taking advantage of your expertise in _formulating the rules_ for Ploop introspection --- i.e. the order in which properties are discovered, which definitions take precedence (e.g. accessor methods, fields, annotations, etc.), and what the annotations mean. I want to document all this in a separate document so there will be no ambiguity, and it will allow us to provide a good test suite of the implementation.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the interest.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/320463732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"garretwilson","id":627125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzEyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/627125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/garretwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1194278656,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE5NDI3ODY1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/events/1194278656","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-05T18:58:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1194278657,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExOTQyNzg2NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/events/1194278657","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-05T18:58:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/321324264","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/37#issuecomment-321324264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/37","id":321324264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTMyNDI2NA==","user":{"login":"garretwilson","id":627125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzEyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/627125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/garretwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https:

There are many issues that could benefit from your expertise and experience with ClassMate and Jackson.\r\n\r\nTo kick things off, I've started an initial discussion on what minimal version of Java we'd like to use:\r\n\r\nhttps://discuss.ploop.io/t/minimal-java-version/17","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/321324264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"garretwilson","id":627125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzEyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/627125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/garretwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/comments/321377237","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/37#issuecomment-321377237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/37","id":321377237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTM3NzIzNw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-09T20:49:19Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T20:49:19Z","body":"Quick note: my account at bitbucket is also `@cowtowncoder`.\r\n\r\nI'll join the other mailing list; although I am ok with discussion on classmate too -- partly since it's low-volume, and partly as discussion is still somewhat relevant.
