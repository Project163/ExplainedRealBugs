The code as is assumes that a generator tracker will always have a generator to, well, track. However, when the generator throws an exception from the constructor, the tracker will keep existing, but won't have a generator. Then, when the test case is exited, the tracker tries to check with the generator to see if it has any more values (and so the test case should be ran again), or not.\r\n\r\nI can probably hot-fix this by having the tracker check whether it does have a generator before trying to use it, but I am not convinced that a tracker should exist empty. The problem is that a significant refactoring would be needed to stop trackers from existing if constructing the generator fails.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/1383179483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/1383186995","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2615#issuecomment-1383186995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2615","id":1383186995,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA2rM5SccIz","user":{"login":"BurningEnlightenment","id":5796962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTY5NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5796962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningEnlightenment","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningEnlightenment/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-15T16:00:15Z","updated_at":"2023-01-15T16:00:15Z","body":"I agree that an empty generator tracker doesn't sound like it should exist.
