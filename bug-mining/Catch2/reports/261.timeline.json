the bug**\r\nThe CTest registration scripts located in the `contrib/` directory are not in a standard [cmake search path](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.18/command/find_package.html#search-procedure). \r\n\r\nThis means when using `add_subdirectory` you cannot simply do `include(Catch)` as the scripts are not found. For reference, this means that these scripts are not found when using [CMake Package Manager (CPM)](https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n`include(Catch)` should work when using `add_subdirectory` for Catch2. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\n\r\nAssuming use of CPM:\r\n```\r\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18 FATAL_ERROR)\r\ninclude(CPM)\r\nCPMAddPackage(\r\n  NAME Catch2\r\n  GITHUB_REPOSITORY catchorg/Catch2\r\n  VERSION 2.13.1\r\n)\r\n\r\ninclude(Catch) # this fails\r\n\r\n# work around is to specify the full path\r\n# include(${Catch2_SOURCE_DIR}/contrib/Catch.cmake)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n - Compiler+version: gcc5.4\r\n - Catch version: 2.13.1\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1805, but instead of adding documentation, these scripts should be made available so that they can just be found as expected when using `add_subdirectory`.
