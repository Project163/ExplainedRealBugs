the bug**\r\nI am trying to trick TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE into parametrizing non type template parameters as types which hold a value. My intent was to test a function templated on a non type for which GENERATE can not be used since the values produced by the generator are not constant expressions. I decided to store the values in a static member variable of a class. The whole approach is similar to [https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1531](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1531).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSince I can access the stored non type template parameter in line 13, I expected it to work the same in the CHECK-macro.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nI have created a godbolt example which reproduces this error: [https://godbolt.org/z/shvGTf1T5](https://godbolt.org/z/shvGTf1T5)\r\nCommenting in the CHECK-macro produces the following linker error:\r\n```\r\n/opt/compiler-explorer/gcc-10.3.0/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10.3.0/../../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /tmp/example-146218.o: in function `BinaryExpr':\r\n/opt/compiler-explorer/libs/catch2/v3.0.0-preview3/src/catch2/internal/catch_decomposer.hpp:78: undefined reference to `IntHolder<1>::x'\r\n/opt/compiler-explorer/gcc-10.3.0/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10.3.0/../../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /opt/compiler-explorer/libs/catch2/v3.0.0-preview3/src/catch2/internal/catch_decomposer.hpp:78: undefined reference to `IntHolder<2>::x'\r\n/opt/compiler-explorer/gcc-10.3.0/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10.3.0/../../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /opt/compiler-explorer/libs/catch2/v3.0.0-preview3/src/catch2/internal/catch_decomposer.hpp:78: undefined reference to `IntHolder<3>::x'\r\nclang-12: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Compiler+version: clang 15.0 and gcc 12.2\r\n - Catch version: 3.0.0-preview3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
