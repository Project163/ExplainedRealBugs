think the some version of the former idea makes sense to me.  For each test case iteration, if there are additional elements in the generator for that iteration left over, they should be discarded, or as you say ignored.\r\nIf the API is specific about specifying the chunk size separately from the number of trials, this should be possible. Would it be possible to statically check that the chunks were properly consumed by local variables? It still doesn't mean the generator won't exhaust early (that depends on the implementation of next()) but might help with making sure the intent of the generator is fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is that we want to generate data, of different types, for a single trial.  We could write a 'chunking' generator like the one above, but it returns a std::tuple<> of the various types that are needed.  It might be nice to have this built-in as a generator type where the API lets the programmer specify the types with callbacks/Generator classes to generate those elements.\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\nint a;\r\nfloat b;\r\nstring c;\r\nCustom d;\r\nint trials = 10;\r\nstd::tie(a,b,c,d) = GENERATE(take(trials, ChunkedGenerator<int, float, string, Custom>(MyIntGenerator, MyFloatGenerator, MyStringGenerator, MyCustomGenerator))\r\n```\r\nWhere My*Generator are custom generator classes for producing those types that are auto-wrapped by a GeneratorWrapper.  \r\n\r\nThis would presume that all of those elements are independently generated, while an approach like I've done with std::vector using std::tuple would work where the generator is aware of all of the types and whatever dependencies they might have.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/465772864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gnatty7","id":8810351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTAzNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8810351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7","html_url":"https://github.com/gnatty7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnatty7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2159739982,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE1OTczOTk4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/2159739982","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"693647c43f799b2c23041e824fab8964ea1146e6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/693647c43f799b2c23041e824fab8964ea1146e6","created_at":"2019-02-23T19:29:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/466684095","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1538#issuecomment-466684095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1538","id":466684095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjY4NDA5NQ==","user":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-23T19:38:40Z","updated_at":"2019-02-23T19:38:40Z","body":"That
