It should be possible to compare it to literal 0, but comparing it to something else is undefined behaviour. Catch2 coerces the 0 into `int` and looks for an overload of the form `operator<(std::strong_ordering, int)`, but standard libraries don't have to provide one.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nDouble parentheses in the `REQUIRE()` statement:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nauto x = 2 <=> 3;\r\nREQUIRE((x < 0)); // compiles and pass\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
