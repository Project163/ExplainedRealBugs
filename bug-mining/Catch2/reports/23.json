I think that gmtime  should be used instead of gmtime_s. This may require a #define to avoid compiler warnings from MSVC.\r\nSetThreadStackGuarantee is a Win32 API so should be available in any Windows compiler but unfortunately isn't with this compiler. Other related functions like AddVectoredExceptionHandler weren't available in the previous 4.9.0 release of MinGW-32. When working with Win32 Structured Exception Handling, its fine to require a working, current version of the Windows headers and libraries. However, SEH is not important in many cases so turning off its use should be an option.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nHere is a minimal Catch file:\r\n\r\n~~~cpp\r\n// Minimal catch test\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN  // This tells Catch to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nWith MinGW-32 GCC 5.3.0, show the version and compile the file:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n>g++ --version && g++ --std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra minimal.cxx -o minimal.exe\r\ng++ (GCC) 5.3.0\r\nCopyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.
