resolved when the Build Setting, `Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting` is set to `NO`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTo be able to compile the program.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n_For iOS_\r\n1. Create a new project from `File->New->Project`. Make sure language selected is Objective-C.\r\n2. Select 'Single View App' from the iOS templates.\r\n3. Go to Build Settings:\r\n    - Confirm `Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting` is set to `Yes`.\r\n    - Add your catch2 single include header path to `Header Search Paths`.\r\n4. Rename `main.m` to `main.mm`\r\n5. Delete `AppDelegate.*` and `ViewController.*` files.\r\n6. Replace content of `main.mm` with:\r\n```\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN\r\n#include <catch2/catch.hpp>\r\n```\r\n7. Compile the program.\r\n\r\n_For macOS_\r\nFollow steps 1-7 from _For iOS_, substituting 2 with:\r\n2. Select 'Cocoa App' from the macOS templates.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n - OS: **macOS Mojave 10.14.5**\r\n - Compiler+version: **Xcode 10.2.1 (10E1001), Xcode 11.0 beta (11M336w)**\r\n - Catch version: **v2.7.2 -- v2.9.1**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project that exhibits this behavior. The sample can be found in the attachment: [catch2arc_compilation_error.zip](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/files/3299282/catch2arc_compilation_error.zip).\r\n\r\nThis sample is packaged with **Catch version v2.9.1**.\r\n\r\nAfter uncompressing the file, open the pre-built Xcode project: `catch2arc_compilation_error.xcodeproj`\r\nIn the project, there are two schemes:\r\n- catch2arc_compilation_error\r\n- catch2arc_compilation_success\r\n\r\nThe targets for each scheme are:\r\n- catch2arc_compilation_error: iOS\r\n- catch2arc_compilation_success: macOS\r\n\r\nThe Build Setting `Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting` for targets is set to:\r\n- catch2arc_compilation_error: Yes\r\n- catch2arc_compilation_success: No\r\n\r\nCompile the scheme `catch2arc_compilation_error` to see the errors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1661/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1661/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11998469161,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM4ZH-dozwAAAALLKhwp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/11998469161","actor":{"login":"uilianries","id":4870173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzAxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4870173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries","html_url":"https://github.com/uilianries","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"08147a23f923103c87d1eac3dc30a9ecc4a753c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uilianries/Catch2/commits/08147a23f923103c87d1eac3dc30a9ecc4a753c4","created_at":"2024-03-04T12:40:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
