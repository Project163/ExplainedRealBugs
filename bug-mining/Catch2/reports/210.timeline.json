Description\r\nThe width for the \"benchmark name\" column in full analysis mode is too large, which makes the output spill beyond `CATCH_CONFIG_CONSOLE_WIDTH`. \r\n\r\nThe width was set to `CATCH_CONFIG_CONSOLE_WIDTH - 32`, but the other three columns are each 14 wide, for a total of 42, not 32, thus giving a total line length of `CATCH_CONFIG_CONSOLE_WIDTH + 10`, when it should obviously not exceed `CATCH_CONFIG_CONSOLE_WIDTH`. (My guess is that `32` was a typo for `42`.)\r\n\r\nThe best solution I see is setting the width of the \"benchmark name\" column to `CATCH_CONFIG_CONSOLE_WIDTH - 43`, the same as it is in the no analysis case. This PR does that.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe the what and the why of your pull request. Remember that these two\r\nare usually a bit different.
