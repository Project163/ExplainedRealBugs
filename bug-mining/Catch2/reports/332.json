There is no `noexcept` or try-catch block included in any examples I could find.\n    - This solution would require adding a try-catch block within `StringMaker<T>::convert()` to guard against the potential exception thrown by `.to_string()`. This \n- Ensure expression decomposition is resilient to exceptions thrown during expression decomposition by:\n    - falling back to the usual `\"{?}\"` expansion if an exception was thrown, and/or\n    - emitting a warning that an unexpected exception was thrown during stringification.\n\nUltimately, I expect/hope the test suite would behave as follows:\n\n```\n...............................................................................\n\ncatch2/catch_tostring.hpp: warning:\n  unexpected exception during stringification of S: invalid\ncatch2/catch_tostring.hpp: warning:\n  unexpected exception during stringification of S: invalid\nmain.cpp: PASSED:\n  CHECK( S() == S() )\nwith expansion:\n  {?} == {?}\n\nmain.cpp: PASSED:\nwith message:\n  this test case should succeed\n\n===============================================================================\nAll tests passed (2 assertions in 1 test case)\n```\n\nNotably, the test suite passes (the same outcome as without `--success`) despite the thrown exceptions, and the emitted warnings clearly indicate the unexpected exception was thrown _during expression decomposition_ rather than by the expression being asserted, which did _not_ throw an exception (as expected) and is therefore correctly reported as a pass.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
