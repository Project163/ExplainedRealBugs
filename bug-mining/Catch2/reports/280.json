That is, `Approx(0.0)` has no effect and `value == Approx(0.0)` behaves the same as `value == 0.0` (not sure about -0.0 though). The reason is that with the current implementation, the epsilon used for comparison is multiplied with zero and thus has no effect.\r\n\r\nThat is unexpected. I understand the reason why this happens, and I understand that float comparisons are hard. However, this makes using catch harder to use with no advantage obvious to the user, and I do think there has to be a better way, even if it's just a special case for zero.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I would suggest to at least document that you cannot use `Approx` on zero, even though I would much prefer if the practicality and user experience would take precedence over the technical purity of the current solution.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1444/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1444/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
