This appears to be due to a mixture of C & C++ functions i.e such as fabs() vs std::fabs() used in v1.1. The relevant C header should be included.\n\n```\n/home/smex/NGL/DEV/5000core/../3rd_party/catch/catch.hpp: In function 'bool     Catch::Detail::operator==(double, const Catch::Detail::Approx&)':\n/home/smex/NGL/DEV/5000core/../3rd_party/catch/catch.hpp:2140: error: 'fabs' was not declared in this scope\ncc: /opt/qnx650/host/linux/x86/usr/lib/gcc/arm-unknown-nto-qnx6.5.0/4.4.2/cc1plus error 1\n```\n\nThe issue was produced under GCC 4.4.2 with an empty .CPP file that has a single \n line to #include <catch/catch.hpp>\n\nThe errors are all due to the use of the 'C'  global namespace functions instead of the C++ std:: namespace functions such as fabs()\n\nIn many places, the C functions are okay to use as there is an inclusion of <cstring> which brings in a large amount of C including malloc() and the likes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/543/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
