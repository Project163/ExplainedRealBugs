The two we are concerned with here are:\r\n\r\n    timespec_ex(std::int64_t nsec);\r\n    timespec_ex(double sec);\r\n\r\nwhich cause an issue when I try to do:\r\n\r\n    CATCH_REQUIRE(a == b);\r\n\r\nbecause you have a macro which has this declaration (`catch2/internal/catch_compare_traits.hpp`):\r\n\r\n    [...]\r\n    struct is_##id##_0_comparable<T,                                          \\\r\n                                  void_t<decltype( std::declval<T>() op 0 )>> \\\r\n        : std::true_type {};\r\n\r\nI think that the value `0` should be taken as an `std::int64_t`, but in this case the compiler decides that `double` is also a viable choice.

I would prefer not to have that operator as it is likely to cause very difficult to find bugs.\r\n\r\n**Reference**\r\n\r\nFor reference, the original is found in the [`snapdev` project](https://github.com/m2osw/snapdev). The file is named `snapdev/timespec_ex.h`. The corresponding test, `tests/catch_timespec_operations.cpp` is what generates the errors.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
