Description\r\nWhen using Catch with cmake/ctest, running `make test` reports all tests have passed even when a test should fail. This is due to CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN returning 0 when exiting even though the compiled test program reports there was a failure. I think in order to make Catch more compatible with ctest and other test tools, it should exit with a non-zero return code (perhaps return with the number of failed test cases?).\r\n\r\nNote: I only tried this with BDD-style tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nI created a [small repo](https://github.com/owo/catch_cmake_test) that will reproduce the problem.\r\nThe README contains instructions for running it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n* Catch version: **v2.2.0**\r\n* Operating System: **macOS 10.13.3**\r\n* Compiler+version: **Apple LLVM version 9.0.0
