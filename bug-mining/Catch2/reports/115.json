There's too much boilerplate.\r\n\r\nI want something like this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nREQUIRE_THROWS_IF(\r\n    function_being_tested(),\r\n    my_exception_type,\r\n    [](my_exception_type const &e) {\r\n        return e.get_thingy() == 42;\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's an alternative that works with Catch2's matcher pattern:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nREQUIRE_THROWS_MATCHES(\r\n    function_being_tested(),\r\n    my_exception_type,\r\n    LambdaMatcher<my_exception_type>(\r\n        [](my_exception_type const &e) {\r\n            return e.get_thingy() == 42;\r\n        }\r\n    ));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `LambdaMatcher<T>` would be provided by Catch2. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate <typename T>\r\nclass LambdaMatcher : public MatcherBase<T> {\r\n  std::function<bool(T const &)> m_closure;\r\n\r\npublic:\r\n  template <typename F>\r\n  lambda_matcher(F &&f) :\r\n    m_closure{std::forward<F>(f)}\r\n  {}\r\n\r\n  bool match(T const &item) const override\r\n  {\r\n    return m_closure(item);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  std::string describe() const override\r\n  {\r\n    return \"value does not match\";\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
