The range generated is actually open at the end - `[n .. m)` - that is, _not_ inclusive of the last value.  Although similar to the usual \"for loop\" it is not (IMO) what is expected: If the user writes `range('A','Z')` he is most probably thinking that _all_ values from `'A'` to `'Z'` _inclusive of both `'A'` and `'Z'`_ will be generated - that is, 26 tests.  The user would be surprised (well, ok, _I_ was surprised) to discover that `'Z'` wasn't generated and if he _didn't_ discover it - IMO, likely? - then he wouldn't be getting the test coverage he desired.\r\n\r\nThe page could document that clearly in text and/or via an example.\r\n\r\n(Actually, \"inside an arithmetic range\" is imprecise enough you might actually think it meant the interval open at _both_ ends ... but that would be ridiculous ...)\r\n\r\n(Note that in a regular expression the notation `[A-Z]` denotes the closed interval including both `'A'` and `'Z'`. Yes, to use that as a justification would be invoking the logical fallacy of _argumentum ad iusto expressio_ - arguing by regular expression - a grievous mistake made by many programmers.  Plus they explicitly chose square bracket notation meaning closed end intervals. Nevertheless, it is a familiar use of a \"range notation\" that includes _both_ ends.)\r\n\r\n(I'm not suggesting that, at this late date, the semantics of `RangeGenerator` be changed, just that it be clearly documented.)","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
