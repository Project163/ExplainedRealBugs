This assumption is not true if the test uses `freopen` or `_dup2()` to redirect stdout, which closes the underlying handle.  This results in `setTextAttribute()` passing an invalid handle to `SetConsoleTextAttribute()`.  If appverif is enabled for handle checking, this hits an app verifier exception.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nColor should work normally, even with application verifier enabled for handle checking, and even when the test being executed redirects stdout and then restores it.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nCreate a test file as follows:\r\n```\r\n#include <io.h>\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN\r\n#include \"catch2\\catch.hpp\"\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE(\"test\", \"[test]\")\r\n{\r\n    HANDLE original_handle = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);\r\n    int fdDup = _dup(_fileno(stdout));\r\n    FILE* fp;\r\n    freopen_s(&fp, \"stdout.out\", \"w\", stdout); // Redirect stdout to a file.\r\n    printf(\"Hello world\\n\");\r\n    _dup2(fdDup, _fileno(stdout)); // Restore stdout to original.\r\n    _close(fdDup);\r\n    HANDLE new_handle = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);\r\n    assert(new_handle != original_handle);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEnable application verifier handle checking: `appverif -enable handles -for test.exe`\r\nRun \"test.exe [test]\" under a debugger.  E.g., in visual studio set the debugger arguments to \"[test]\".  The use of a filter will force catch to initialize Win32ColourImpl before the test runs, and then try to use the handle after the test completes.\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\nCompiler version: Visual Studio 2019\r\nCatch version: v2.8.0 using the CatchOrg.Catch nuget package\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
