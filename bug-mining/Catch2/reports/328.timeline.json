Summary\r\n\r\n```SUMMARY: None```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Purpose of change\r\n\r\nMake character stamina tests pass on mingw cross-compiler CI\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution\r\n\r\nCompare the

Catch2\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nFollowup to https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/pull/1200. Verified by [this patch](https://spruce.mongodb.com/version/66df13a6328d9600078d4dd9).\r\n\r\nRefactors the test suite to use the new `SKIP()` macro. Updates EVG test scripts to use the Catch2 compact reporter. Reduces output verbosity in EVG compile-and-test tasks.\r\n\r\n## Skipping Tests\r\n\r\nCatch2 3.3.0 introduced the `SKIP()` macro to explicitly skip test cases and sections at runtime, which uses the same exception-throwing pattern as `FAIL()` but marks the test case as \"skipped\" instead of either \"succeeded\" or \"failed\".\r\n\r\nThis means the following pattern of code in the current test suite:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nTEST_CASE(\"example\") {\r\n    if (check_skip_conditions()) {\r\n        WARN(\"Skipping - Skip Reason\");\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    test_actions();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan now be written as the more straightforward pattern:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nTEST_CASE(\"example\") {\r\n    if (check_skip_conditions()) {\r\n        SKIP(\"Skip Reason\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    test_actions(); // Not evaluated.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also changes Catch2 output from (using `[index_view]` test cases as an example):\r\n\r\n```\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ncreate_one\r\n  commitQuorum option\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/index_view.cpp:180\r\n...............................................................................\r\n\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/index_view.cpp:182: warning:\r\n  skip: commitQuorum option requires a replica set\r\n\r\n===============================================================================\r\nAll tests passed (38 assertions in 4 test cases)\r\n```\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ncreate_one\r\n  commitQuorum option\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/index_view.cpp:180\r\n...............................................................................\r\n\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/index_view.cpp:182: SKIPPED:\r\nexplicitly with message:\r\n  commitQuorum option requires a replica set\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\ntest cases:  4 |  3 passed | 1 skipped\r\nassertions: 38 | 38 passed\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> The \"skipped\" metric considers a test case where _any_ section has been skipped as a skipped test case. e.g. given:\r\n> ```cpp\r\n> TEST_CASE(\"example\") {\r\n>   SECTION(\"one\") { CHECK(true); }\r\n>   SECTION(\"two\") { CHECK(true); SKIP(\"evaluate and skip\"); }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> Catch2 reports: `test cases: 1 | 1 skipped` and `assertions: 2 | 2 passed`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also addresses potential issues with test case failure reports due to https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1292#issuecomment-2334798593, as exposed by introduction of the `SKIP()` macro to `run_unified_format_tests_in_env_dir`. (`CHECK(fn())` where `fn()` evaluates its own assertions appears to be somewhat of a Catch2 anti-pattern.)\r\n\r\nThe `--allow-running-no-tests` flag is required to avoid an entirely-skipped test executable (no test case succeeded or failed) from being treated as a failure. The removal of this flag (such that at least one test case succeeds per test executable) may be considered in the future, but for now, given our skip-heavy test suite, this flag is used instead.\r\n\r\n## Compact Reporter\r\n\r\nIn an effort to reduce the verbosity of CI task output, this PR proposes using Catch2's compact reporter.\r\n\r\nAgain using `[index_view]` test cases as example, current output for skipped test cases looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ncreate_one\r\n  commitQuorum option\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/index_view.cpp:180\r\n...............................................................................\r\n\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/index_view.cpp:182: warning:\r\n  skip: commitQuorum option requires a replica set\r\n\r\n===============================================================================\r\nAll tests passed (38 assertions in 4 test cases)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `SKIP()` and the compact reporter, the output looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/index_view.cpp:182: skipped: 'commitQuorum option requires a replica set'\r\ntest cases:  4 |  3 passed | 1 skipped\r\nassertions: 38 | 38 passed\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the compact reporter reduces total output line count in test tasks by about 2K lines (depending on the task/variant).\r\n\r\nThe compact reporter does not include test case or section name information. This means some care must be taken to avoid ambiguous skip messages, e.g. (note: no distinguishable information differentiating the skipping of individual tests):\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/spec/unified_tests/runner.cpp:1155: skipped: 'none of the runOnRequirements were met'\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/spec/unified_tests/runner.cpp:1155: skipped: 'none of the runOnRequirements were met'\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/spec/unified_tests/runner.cpp:1155: skipped: 'none of the runOnRequirements were met'\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo avoid ambiguity, the `SKIP()` macro should contain uniquely identifying information in its skip reason, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/spec/unified_tests/runner.cpp:1154: skipped: 'description := observeSensitiveCommands' with 1 message: 'observeSensitiveCommands: getnonce is observed with observeSensitiveCommands=true: none of the runOnRequirements were met: [ { \"maxServerVersion\" : \"6.1.99\" } ]'\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/spec/unified_tests/runner.cpp:1154: skipped: 'description := observeSensitiveCommands' with 1 message: 'observeSensitiveCommands: getnonce is not observed with observeSensitiveCommands=false: none of the runOnRequirements were met: [ { \"maxServerVersion\" : \"6.1.99\" } ]'\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/spec/unified_tests/runner.cpp:1154: skipped: 'description := observeSensitiveCommands' with 1 message: 'observeSensitiveCommands: getnonce is not observed by default: none of the runOnRequirements were met: [ { \"maxServerVersion\" : \"6.1.99\" } ]'\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, preferably, be called within the test case or section that is being skipped for more accurate source location information, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/change_streams.cpp:98: skipped: 'change streams require replica set'\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/change_streams.cpp:120: skipped: 'change streams require replica set'\r\nsrc/mongocxx/test/change_streams.cpp:388: skipped: 'change streams require replica set'\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost of the substantial changes in this PR pertain to making skip messages uniquely identifiable.\r\n\r\n## Quirks\r\n\r\nWhen a test case is _skipped_, informational log messages are truncated to output only the _first_ such message along with the skip reason. These may be used in place of uniquely identifying info in the skip reason itself, although it is still preferable to use the skip reason for reliability. e.g. given:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nTEST_CASE(\"example\") {\r\n  INFO(\"first\");\r\n  INFO(\"second\");\r\n  INFO(\"third\");\r\n  SKIP(\"skip reason\"); // Line 5\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Catch2 compact reporter outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.cpp:5: skipped: 'first' with 3 messages: 'skip reason'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a test case _fails_, all informational messages are emitted in full. e.g. given:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nTEST_CASE(\"example\") {\r\n  INFO(\"first\");\r\n  INFO(\"second\");\r\n  INFO(\"third\");\r\n  FAIL(\"fail reason\"); // Line 5\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Catch2 compact reporter outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.cpp:5: failed: explicitly with 4 messages: 'first' and 'second' and 'third' and 'fail reason'\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven output is typically overwhemingly dominanted by skipped test case messages, the absence of test case or section name(s) on potential assertion failure is considered an acceptable compromise. If further contextual information is required beyond what log messages reveal, the `--reporter compact` flag may be temporarily disabled in a patch build as needed.\r\n\r\nIf these quirks of the compact reporter are considered undesirable (more verbose output logs with contextual information included by default is preferable), the changes related to using the compact reporter may be removed from this PR. (However, it is my opinion that the compact reporter encourages writing cleaner tests.)\r\n\r\n## Further Output Reduction\r\n\r\nSome minor adjustments to the compile-and-test scripts further reduce output of EVG tasks by about ~1.5K lines (depending on the task/variant):\r\n\r\n- Repeated invocation of CMake configure and build commands: these have been reduced when able (taking advantage of CMake's support for multiple `--target <target>` flags).\r\n- The `OUTPUT_QUIET` argument is added to `execute_process_and_check_result` to reduce distcheck output (which was nearly doubling the output line count).\r\n- Removed a redundant rebuild of examples executables in `test.sh`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/issues/1206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/issues/1206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18841138845,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM4TWfSlzwAAAARjBPad","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/18841138845","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2d51076cc3a16f8ad3c52eda8ca4e44c39613537","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/2d51076cc3a16f8ad3c52eda8ca4e44c39613537","created_at":"2025-07-27T18:32:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18841345443,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA2rM4TWfSlzwAAAARjCB2j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/18841345443","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"fa4fbd7dfedf40e80c691d2ba276d5febb38ef0f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/fa4fbd7dfedf40e80c691d2ba276d5febb38ef0f","created_at":"2025-07-27T19:38:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18841354857,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM4TWfSlzwAAAARjCEJp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/18841354857","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d547cae549f484dda3c6a2b3cc5f71b9db40e842","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/d547cae549f484dda3c6a2b3cc5f71b9db40e842","created_at":"2025-07-27T19:41:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/3124686780","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1292#issuecomment-3124686780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1292","id":3124686780,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA2rM66Pu-8","user":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers"
