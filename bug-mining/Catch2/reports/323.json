As a result, the library is not found when using pkg-config for a debug build of Catch2.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe actual library name should be referenced in the .pc file for all build configurations.\n\n**Reproduction steps**\n- `<prefix>/lib/libCatch2.a` does not exist\n- build Catch2 with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug, and install to <prefix>\n- `pkg-config catch2 --libs` shows e.g. `-L<prefix>/lib -lCatch2`\n- `<prefix>/lib/libCatch2.a` does not exist, but - `<prefix>/lib/libCatch2d.a` does.\n\n**Platform information:**\n<!-- Fill in any extra information that might be important for your issue. -->\n - OS: **Ubuntu 24.04**\n - Compiler+version: **GCC 13.3.0**\n - Catch version: **v3.8.1**\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2979/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
