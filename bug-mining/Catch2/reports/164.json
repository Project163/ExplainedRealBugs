The thing is that certain types may or may not be synonymous depending on the current platform, and when writing cross-platform code, one may just want to list all imaginable types. Sure, the test case may run twice for the same actual type, but so what? \r\n\r\nExample: `size_t` may be a synonym for `unsigned long` - then `size_t` is incompatible with `unsigned long long`, or it could be vice versa. I wanted to simply list all three (`size_t, unsigned long, unsigned long long`) and I got this compilation error.","closed_by":{"login":"JoeyGrajciar","id":5606370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDYzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5606370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar","html_url":"https://github.com/JoeyGrajciar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeyGrajciar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1628/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1628/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
