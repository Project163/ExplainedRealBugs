Good thing about Catch is that, setup was so easy, I could setup everything in 5 minutes and started writing testcases!! \r\nComing to my issue. My application runs in some loop and the normal way of exiting it is by ctrl+c / SIGABRT. But when this happens CATCH says it failed. Is there any way to make normal exit when SIGABRT is received ? I tried handling SIGABRT by calling exit(0) in the handler, but still the testcase fails.\r\nCan you please suggest me how to proceed ?\r\nI tried finding others posts regarding this, but none of them helped.
