#2668\r\nInstead of grepping for the reporter, use it in the process and check for the error code\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nInside the `catch_discover_tests` CMake script, instead of searching for the supposed reporter in the verbose (!) output of --list-reporters, actually use it as the actual reporter and check for failures when doing so. This will avoid failures when a correct reporter is not spelled in the correct case (reporters are case insensitive), and it avoids success when the supposed reporter is only a fill word in one of the reporter descriptions.\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issues\r\n- #2668 fixed\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2669/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8932272948,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA2rM5ieNstzwAAAAIUZ6s0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/8932272948","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-05T08:12:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8932273649,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM5ieNstzwAAAAIUZ63x","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/8932273649","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"50bf00e266b32531385c9098f2676875c0aa8ac2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/50bf00e266b32531385c9098f2676875c0aa8ac2","created_at":"2023-04-05T08:12:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
