As far as we can tell, this does not affect MSVC nor GCC on Linux, so it is something specific about interplay between GCC and Windows.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't have MSYS here, but I do have Nuwen MinGW and WSL. Testing these, I get these numbers:\r\n\r\n* WSL + g++ 5.4 needs ~5 seconds to compile Catch 1.8.2 main\r\n* WSL + g++ 5.4 needs ~7.6 seconds to compile Catch2 2.2.2 main\r\n* WSL linking against single test file requires ~0.33 s for Catch 1.8.2\r\n* WSL linking against single test file requires ~0.55 s for Catch2 2.2.2\r\n\r\n* MinGW g++ 7.3.0 needs 3.8 s to compile Catch 1.8.2 main\r\n* MinGW g++ 7.3.0 needs 8.2 s to compile Catch2 2.2.2 main\r\n* MinGW linking needs 2.3 s to link Catch 1.8.2\r\n* MinGW linking needs 9 s to link Catch2 2.2.2\r\n\r\nIn other words, MinGW links terribly slowly, but should not link _that_ slowly.
