The `scripts/approvalTests.py` program, which is responsible for this test, uses this code in `scripts/scriptCommon.py` to determine the prefix to strip:\r\n```\r\ncatchPath = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath( os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0])))\r\n```\r\nwhich in my case is equivalent to setting it to `/data/macabretmp/dj`, not to the required value of `/home/dj/tmp`.\r\n\r\nOne approach to avoiding this would be for `scripts/scriptCommon.py`  to parse the directory from one of the CMake artifacts in the build directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expect that the tests work regardless of whether or not the directory is reached via a symbolic link.\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n<!-- Fill in any extra information that might be important for your issue. -->\r\n - OS: **Debian 9**\r\n - Compiler+version: **GCC v6.3.0**\r\n - Catch version: **v2.9.1**\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1691/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
