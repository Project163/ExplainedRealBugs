The first `REQUIRE` compiles just fine, while the second does not:\r\n```c++\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\nvoid test() {\r\n    struct Y { \r\n        uint32_t v : 1;\r\n    };  \r\n    Y y{0};\r\n    REQUIRE(y.v == 0);\r\n    REQUIRE(0 == y.v);\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is the following operator (passing bitfields by reference is not possible):\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate<typename LhsT>\r\ntemplate<typename RhsT>\r\nauto ExprLhs<LhsT>::operator == ( RhsT&& rhs ) -> BinaryExpr<LhsT, RhsT&> const {\r\n    return BinaryExpr<LhsT, RhsT&>( compareEqual( m_lhs, rhs ), m_lhs, \"==\", rhs ); \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplacing it with the following version fixes the issue:\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate<typename LhsT>\r\ntemplate<typename RhsT>\r\nauto ExprLhs<LhsT>::operator == ( RhsT const & rhs ) -> BinaryExpr<LhsT, RhsT const &> const {\r\n    return BinaryExpr<LhsT, RhsT const &>( compareEqual( m_lhs, rhs ), m_lhs, \"==\", rhs );\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nI have not looked deeper into the code.
