Disabling this flag gets rid of the warning.\n\nApparently Microsoft has deprecated the /Wp64 flag and is recommending /W4 instead, which does not produce this issue with Catch. However it would still be preferable to be able to use /Wp64 without this warning. Unfortunately my previous patch above doesn't seem to be relevant to Catch 1.0\n\nMore info about /Wp64 is here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/7171295/why-is-wp64-deprecated\n\nFurther info:\n\nFrom my latest test with MSVC2005 and Catch 1.0 the warning is still displayed in both Debug and Release configurations of a command line project (see below).\n\nVisual studio lists the C++ command line as:\n\n/O2 /GL /D \"WIN32\" /D \"NDEBUG\" /D \"_CONSOLE\" /D \"_UNICODE\" /D \"UNICODE\" /FD /EHsc /MD /Fo\"Release\\\" /Fd\"Release\\vc80.pdb\" /W3 /nologo /c /Wp64 /Zi /TP
