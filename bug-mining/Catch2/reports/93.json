Not sure if this is just an issue on my system, VS or with Catch. Read the below sample to better understand the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nIn Visual Studio 2015 I created empty C++ project and copied the catch.hpp file to the source folder and then created three new files:\r\nmain.cpp\r\n```\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\n```\r\n\r\ntest1.cpp\r\n```\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\n// Notice the empty lines below\r\n\r\n// This comment also adds one to the test2.cpp failing test cases reported line number\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE(\"test1\", \"\") {\r\n\tREQUIRE(1 == 1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ntest2.cpp\r\n```\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE(\"test2\", \"\") {\r\n\tREQUIRE(1 == 2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOutcome\r\n```\r\ntest2\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ntest2.cpp(3)\r\n...............................................................................\r\ntest2.cpp(8): FAILED:\r\n  REQUIRE( 1 == 2 )\r\n\r\n===============================================================================\r\ntest cases: 2 | 1 passed | 1 failed\r\nassertions: 2 | 1 passed | 1 failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect test2.cpp(8) to be test2.cpp(4).\r\n\r\nI also noticed that if I add a test0.cpp with same content as test2.cpp except TEST_CASE name changed to test0 then it again works as expected.\r\n\r\nNote that I also saw in some cases that the test2.cpp(3) line was wrong too, but this simplified sample doesn't demonstrate that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n* Catch version: **Catch v1.8.1**\r\n* Operating System: **Windows 7 x64**\r\n* Compiler+version: **MS Visual Studio 2015 VC++**\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/881/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/881/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
