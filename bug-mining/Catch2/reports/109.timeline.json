Description\r\n\r\nIn `catch_compiler_capabilities.h` there are some special-case checks on `_MSVC_VER` to identify C++11/14/17 features to turn on feature macros, since [__cplusplus is known to be unreliable](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/763051/a-value-of-predefined-macro-cplusplus-is-still-199711l) on VS - see #697 and #479.\r\n\r\nHowever there doesn't seem to be any detection of a couple of these - e.g. `CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_TUPLE`, `CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_IS_ENUM`, `CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_OVERRIDE`, and `CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_LONG_LONG`. This means the default stringifying doesn't work for tuples or enum classes, though it does if these macros are manually defined before including catch.\r\n\r\nI believe these features should be available at the following versions:\r\n\r\n| Macro | C++ Feature | _MSC_VER | VS Version |\r\n| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- |\r\n| CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_TUPLE | std::tuple | >= 1500 | VS 2008* |\r\n| CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_IS_ENUM | std::is_enum (type_traits) | >= 1400 | VS 2005 |\r\n| CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_OVERRIDE | override | >= 1700 | VS 2012 |\r\n| CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_LONG_LONG | long long | >= 1600 | VS 2010 |\r\n\r\nSourced from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx) and [here](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support).\r\n\r\n*Possibly earlier, this was just the earliest docs version on MSDN.\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n\r\n* Catch version: v1.9.7 (Generated: 2017-08-10 23:49:15.233907)\r\n* Compiler+version: VS2015, although I believe the same will apply to VS2017 as `__cplusplus` is still defined to 199711L

gave this a whirl on the 2.2.0 release, it works great thanks!\r\n\r\nOne thing I realised after actually implementing it though is that actually a lot of the things I want to stringify are enums, which unfortunately never make it down to this fallback but instead get coerced and printed as integers earlier.\r\n\r\nI realise that's sort of a separate request so I can open a new issue for it, but it would be very nice to pipe enum stringification through the fallback as well (I already have an overload defined for all my enums).\r\n\r\nIf it's possible through sufficient C++ magic to seamlessly detect an overload of the custom function and fall back to the underlying type if it doesn't exist that would be superb, but for my purposes I'd be happy with a #define to opt-in to having all stringifying responsibilities on the `CATCH_CONFIG_FALLBACK_STRINGIFIER` with resulting failed compilation if any enum is not
