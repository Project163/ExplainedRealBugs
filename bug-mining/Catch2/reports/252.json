The documentation on [Writing your own reporter](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/reporters.md#writing-your-own-reporter) pretty much only says that \"At time of writing the interface is subject to some changes so is not, yet, documented here.\". I see some changes in version 3, but not huge. What are the plans? Should this be now documented?\r\n2. The JunitReporter class is not extensible: the only way I figured out how to fix it was to duplicate the class and add the functionality I needed. Although the class architecture does not make it very easy to extend, modifying the class API a bit made it possible for me to do what I needed (see [here](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/compare/v2.x...loximann:junit_custom_section)). I wonder if there is wider need to support writing custom properties for each test case.\r\n3. Certain components can be only reused in a hacky manner. The only easy way was writing all the code in the same file as main.cpp, where CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER had been defined. Defining my class inheriting from CumulativeReporterBase was only possible by defining CATCH_CONFIG_EXTERNAL_INTERFACES. There were a few additional components I wanted to reuse (isWhiteSpace, isBreakable, isBreakableAfter, Column) which I did not figure out how to reuse in external code.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. I can prepare pull requests for the first two points. but I am not sure how to address the third one.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
