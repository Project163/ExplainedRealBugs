We are using v9. I think the issue here is that for @avitase `hicpp-vararg` triggers, while the `NOLINT` is limited to `cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg`. However, the `hicpp` warning [is an alias](https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.0/tools/clang/tools/extra/docs/clang-tidy/checks/hicpp-vararg.html) for the `cppcoreguidelines` one. clang-tidy doesn't seem to take this into account when processing the NOLINT - even on v9: If I also enable `hicpp-vararg` in our config, I get the same warning locally. So I guess the solution would be to either extend the existing NOLINT\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* NOLINT(cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg, hicpp-vararg) */\r\n```\r\n\r\n(works for me and my preference) or make

Catch2's `REQUIRE` triggers clang-tidy to warn about the usage of `var_arg`. Disabling `cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg` and `hicpp-vararg` globally (in .clang-tidy) or using `NOLINT` at each invocation of `REQUIRE` resolves this issue. The former is maybe the easiest solution, the latter the more accurate approach.

`NOLINT(cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg)` in my code, but\n`hicpp-vararg` warning is still reported by clang-tidy, even though it\nis documented as alias of the former.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nRun clang-tidy with \"*-vararg\" checks enabled on the following snippet\n```cpp\nvoid varargs(...) {}\n\nvoid foo() {\n    varargs(1, 2, 3); // NOLINT(hicpp-vararg)\n}\n```\n\nThe output will be \n\n```\n/mnt/c/temp/Catch/1921.cpp:4:5: warning: do not call c-style vararg functions [cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg]\n    varargs(1, 2, 3); // NOLINT(hicpp-vararg)\n    ^\nSuppressed 1 warnings (1 NOLINT).\n```\n\n## Expected result\n\nI expect no warnings to be issued, because `hicpp-vararg` and\n`cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg` warnings are documented to be aliases:\n\nhttps://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/tools/clang/tools/extra/docs/clang-tidy/checks/hicpp-vararg.html\n\nI would also prefer the output to report 1 suppressed warning, but I\nthink reporting 2 is also acceptable.\n\n\n## Other information\nThis came up due to an issue in Catch2's issue tracker:\nhttps://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1921\n\nCatch2 uses `__builtin_constant_p` to trigger warnings in unevaluated\nexpressions, which clang-tidy flags as use of a variadic function (I\nconsider this as a bug, but will open separate report for it). When\nsuppressed with `NOLINT(cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg)`, the warning\nis still triggered when user enables hicpp-vararg check.\n\nThe linked issue confirms that this replicates for clang-tidy 7 and 9,\nI also reproduced the issue on clang-tidy 10.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/llvm/llvm-project/issues/45204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/llvm/llvm-project/issues/45204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
