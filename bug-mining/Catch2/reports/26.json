Are you saying that you would have foo.cpp foo_test.cpp and catch.cpp (with the two lines) all compiled together. Then you might have bar.cpp so you would compile bar.cpp, bar_test.cpp and catch.cpp together for testing bar code? Then if you had foobar.cpp (that depends on foo and bar) you would compile foo.cpp, foo_test.cpp, bar.cpp, bar_test.cpp, foobar.cpp, foobar_test.cpp, and catch.cpp all together?\n\nYou do a great job of explaining why it is slow but don't explain very well what a solution would look like other than saying a single cpp file with the two lines. I think the simple example (of a real world situation) would make everything clear. \n\nThanks,\nSLDR\n(Stephen L.
