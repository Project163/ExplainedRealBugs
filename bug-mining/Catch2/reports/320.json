If so, could you provide a trust path between the \"old\" and the \"new\" key (e.g. a commit or a document signed with one of the \"old\" keys attesting that the \"new\" 56FB686C9DFC8E2C key is trustworthy).\nFor what it's worth, when dealing with multiple keys / key holders, a common way to provide such a trust path is to maintain a dedicated document within the repo, for which each changes / commits should be signed with an already referenced / trusted key. See [this](https://github.com/Nitrokey/pynitrokey/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) for instance.\n\ncc @anthraxx","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2970/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
