AddressSanitizer reports `stack-use-after-return` for those. It turns out that the root cause seems to be usage of `ValuesGenerator<bool>` in the affected tests.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n- No segfaults / ASAN findings.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\n\r\nThe following minimal example reproduces the issue 100% locally:\r\n\r\n- SEGFAULT when executing binary compiled with GCC \r\n- `stack-use-after-return` reported by ASAN when analysing binary compiled with clang\r\n\r\nWhen compiling with clang (without ASAN) and running the test, the crash does _not_ occur.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTEST_CASE(\"Bool Generator Segfault\")\r\n{\r\n    // Segfaults\r\n    auto state = GENERATE(values<bool>({ true, false }));\r\n    // Those two do not ...\r\n    // auto state = GENERATE(true, false);\r\n    // auto state = GENERATE(as<bool> {}, true, false);\r\n    SECTION(\"foo bar\")\r\n    {\r\n        INFO(state);\r\n        SUCCEED();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUsing the alternative syntax (which, if I understood the docs correctly leads to two separate instances of `ValueGenerator<T>` being concatenated instead of a single `ValuesGenerator<T>`) does not segfault and triggers no ASAN findings.\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n<!-- Fill in any extra information that might be important for your issue. -->\r\n\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Compiler+version: **GCC 7.4.0 / clang 8.0.0**\r\n - Catch version: **v2.9.1**\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
