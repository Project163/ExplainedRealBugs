The testing framework itself works very well, but the problem is that catch returns an exit code of 0 even with failed tests (which makes no sense to me)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nThis is only relevant for bug reports, but if you do have one,\r\nplease provide a minimal set of steps to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nUsually this means providing a small and self-contained code using Catch\r\nand specifying compiler flags/tools used if relevant.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHere is an example _without_ CMake that illustrates the problem.\r\nI have a file `main.cpp`:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN\r\n#include \"Catch2.hpp\"\r\n\r\nint test()\r\n{\r\n    return 7;\r\n}\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE(\"should fail\")\r\n{\r\n    REQUIRE(test() == 2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this file gets me:\r\n```\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\na.out is a Catch v2.2.0 host application.\r\nRun with -? for options\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nshould fail\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nmain.cpp:9\r\n...............................................................................\r\n\r\nmain.cpp:11: FAILED:\r\n  REQUIRE( test() == 2 )\r\nwith expansion:\r\n  7 == 2\r\n\r\n===============================================================================\r\ntest cases: 1 | 1 failed\r\nassertions: 1 | 1 failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho $?\r\n```\r\nResults in the output 0.\r\n\r\nWhy isn't the exit code non-zero? I am using CTest, so if there is a failing test, then CTest doesn't report it. This makes the framework particularly useless if failing tests are not reported because otherwise, tests will always pass. How should I fix this so that the correct exit code is shown? \r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n<!--\r\nFill in any extra information that might be important for your issue.\r\n\r\nIf your issue is a bugreport, definitely fill out at least the following.\r\n-->\r\n* Catch version: **v2.2.0**\r\n* Operating System: **Ubuntu (Online on Cloud9 IDE)**\r\n* Compiler+version: **G++ 5.2**\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
