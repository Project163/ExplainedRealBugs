do not submit pull requests changing the `version.hpp`\r\nor the single-include `catch.hpp` file, these are changed\r\nonly when a new release is made.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting a PR you should

Remember that these two\r\nare usually a bit different. As an example, if you have made various changes\r\nto decrease the number of new strings allocated, thats what. The why probably\r\nwas that you have a large set of tests and found that this speeds them up.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes 2 out of 3 problems that I've encountered with CMake + Ninja:\r\n\r\n1.

If in doubt, leave it open and reference it in the\r\nPR itself, so that maintainers can decide.\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1914450929,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkxNDQ1MDkyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/1914450929","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"1faccd601d904a951142d8fba82914a8325b764e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/1faccd601d904a951142d8fba82914a8325b764e","created_at":"2018-10-19T10:46:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12686901919,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM4VXGPRzwAAAAL0MsKf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/12686901919","actor":{"login":"vadz","id":146917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjkxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz","html_url":"https://github.com/vadz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1faccd601d904a951142d8fba82914a8325b764e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vadz/Catch/commits/1faccd601d904a951142d8fba82914a8325b764e","created_at":"2024-05-02T17:32:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
