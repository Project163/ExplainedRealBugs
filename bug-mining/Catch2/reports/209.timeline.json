In plain C++ code, this will not warn\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nsize_t i = ...;\r\nif (i < 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause the literal `2` can be easily converted into `size_t` without losing information. However, if you add extra indirection like Catch does, then that `2` is inferred to be an `int`. This means that without warning suppression, using `REQUIRE(i < 2);` in the above example would cause a warning about mismatched signedness in comparison.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously not ideal, so Catch2 uses a mitigation: it mentions the expression _again_ in a context that will not be evaluated, like this: `while( (void)0, (false) && static_cast<bool>( !!(__VA_ARGS__) ) )`, where `__VA_ARGS__` is expression inside `REQUIRE`.\r\n\r\nThis works for MSVC, and used to work for Clang (but I had to go back to clang 3.4 for the warning to trigger), but apparently does not for current version of Clang or GCC.\r\n\r\nSummary: I would like to have some way to force the compiler to check the code as written, without decomposition, but the suppression inside the actual evaluation is required for usability.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/596189891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3108321889,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMxMDgzMjE4ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/3108321889","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-08T10:30:12Z","label":{"name":"Help
