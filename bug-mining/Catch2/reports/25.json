But if you give a simple type to `REQUIRE_THROWS_AS({...}, some_type);`, the macro will generate a catch by value (`catch(some_type)`). Not really a problem, but `clang-tidy` complains. Of course I can just use references myself, but it is not clear to the user that he always has to do this. Maybe we could change the `INTERNAL_CATCH_THROWS_AS` macro): \n\n```\n-            catch( exceptionType ) { \\\n+            catch( std::add_lvalue_reference<exceptionType>::type ) { \\\n```\n\nUnfortunately this solution only works in C++11.\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/542/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
