I have some unit tests marked as `[!mayfail]`, so runnit unit tests with `ctest` return an error code of 0, even though those tests fail. However, when using the Junit reporter (which I need for Jenkins), those tests still appear as failed in the XML output. Would it be possible to mark them as `skipped`? It seems one can add a `<skipped />` element under the test case like so:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <testcase classname=\"test_bla.global\" name=\"my_test\" time=\"0.0\" status=\"run\">\r\n      <skipped message=\"mayfail\"/>\r\n      <failure message=\"foo\" type=\"REQUIRE\">\r\nFAILED:\r\n...\r\n      </failure>\r\n    </testcase>\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2116/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
