It's not as elegant though as we would have two ExternalProject_Add blocks, one for CI, and one for everything else. Plus, I think in general when someone wants to say build and test the GSL, they don't want build and test the GSL's unittest selftests. I think it would be a useful option for projects using Catch, and it would be a pretty simple mod to the CMakeLists.txt file to support.
