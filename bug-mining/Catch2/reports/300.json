Combination of multiple arguments:\r\n```\r\na* ~ab* abc             Matches all tests that start with 'a', except those that\r\n                        start with 'ab', except 'abc', which is included\r\n```\r\nThis suggests that `\"<filter1> <filter2>\"` behaves like an OR operation, given the comment \"except 'abc', which is included\". Trying this in practice shows that 'abc' is not actually included. This suggests the real behavior is actually closer to an AND operation. The example should be updated.\r\n\r\n 2. Commas:\r\n```\r\nA series of tags form an AND expression whereas a comma-separated sequence forms an OR expression.\r\n```\r\nThis suggests that commas can be used for OR operations when filtering by tags, but in practice this also works when filtering by names, and in fact a comma can be put in between a name and a tag filter within the same \"filter\". It seems like it would be worth showing this as an example.\r\n\r\n 3. Not sure about that one, but I think the order of the filters is now irrelevant?\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nRead the docs.\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2738/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
