Contains is defined for vector now, an cannot be easily extended to support other containers. Writing generic ElementsAre also fails for me.\r\nIn gmock they operate on any class that has container-like interface. You just write:\r\n`EXPECT_THAT(some_container, ElementsAre(e0, e1, ..., en));`\r\nIn Catch we must directly specify container type under ElementsAre.\r\nGmock does this by trying to cast given matcher to expected one - at this point you can write generic conversion operator that will create matcher for specific container.\r\n\r\nMaybe REQUIRE_THAT makro should be changed? Or current approach has some advantage that I fail to see?\r\n\r\nBR","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
