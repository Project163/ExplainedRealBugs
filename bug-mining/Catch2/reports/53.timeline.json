The solution that we are using is to add a templated overload, that uses SFINAE to only work with types that can be converted to double.\r\n\r\nNow, for `Approx::margin` this isn't semantically problematic, as `Approx(temperature(72)).margin(temperature(2))`, makes perfect sense.  However for `Approx::epsilon` the situation is not quite so clear-cut, as `Approx(temperature(72)).epsilon(temperature(0.001))` does not make semantic sense.\r\n\r\nThis could be solved in two ways.\r\n\r\n1) Specifically make `Approx::epsilon` only accept floating point types (using `std::is_floating_point`).\r\n2) Damn the semantics, make `Approx::epsilon` accept anything.\r\n\r\nPersonally I like the second option better.\r\n\r\n\r\n*There is also `Approx::scale`, but I don't think anybody is actually using that one.*","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/296642712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/296805924","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/888#issuecomment-296805924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/888","id":296805924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjgwNTkyNA==","user":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T20:01:23Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T20:01:23Z","body":"After
