The work-arounds are not getting the job done in our case. We're using C++17, and could use the PPL to run tests asynchronously and in parallel. We have about 1,000 tests, nearly all of which are file I/O intensive. They can take over 30 minutes to complete. We add several more such tests every week. Running them in separate processes has not shortened the elapsed time.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/554010803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ScottHutchinson","id":16599128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk5MTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16599128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson","html_url":"https://github.com/ScottHutchinson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottHutchinson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/672391192","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/399#issuecomment-672391192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/399","id":672391192,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MjM5MTE5Mg==","user":{"login":"bowie7070","id":7979692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Nzk2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7979692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070","html_url":"https://github.com/bowie7070","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowie7070/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-12T00:19:09Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T01:45:47Z","body":"In case it helps someone else I have found the GNU parallel program very helpful complement to catch2 because it solves two problems I currently have.

We have for one library about 4,500 tests with an average run time of about 5 seconds (per test). I've just started using GNU parallel to farm them out into individual processes and we are getting a 10x or more speedup. It has made it viable to run all of our tests again during the day while making changes.\r\n\r\nRunning one test per process makes two things very easy. First, providing a good diagnostic when a test fails. Second, finding the diagnostic output from only the failing test.\r\n\r\nThe main issue I am worried about is that we have lost the ability to check for hidden state in our code. That is, run test A then test B and everything passes but run test B then test A and one or more of them fails.

Description\r\n\r\nI added tests for `sf::Clock`. This was a little tricky. `sf::Clock` is implemented in terms of `std::chrono` and `std::chrono` is being used to test it. This shouldn't be a problem though since we must assume that our standard library implementation is correct. There's no getting around that assumption.\r\n\r\nThe idea for these tests is that if you periodically check the state of the timer at 100 millisecond intervals you can check that the clock is reporting roughly the elapsed time one would expect. I used a rather generous 10 millisecond margin since I'm not sure what level of accuracy and precision we'd expect. On my machine I see <5 millisecond deviations so I doubled that to be safe since flaky tests are a huge problem.\r\n\r\nAnother test philosophy would be to measure the elapsed time, sleep a few milliseconds, measure again, then test that the elapsed time increased. This is less prone to flakiness but is also a less rigorous test that what is currently written.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n* [ ] Tested on Linux\r\n* [ ] Tested on Windows\r\n* [x] Tested on macOS\r\n* [
