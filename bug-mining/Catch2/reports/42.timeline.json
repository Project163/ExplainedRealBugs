This executable runs an R interpreter (used for running programs written in the R language), and that R interpreter can (and does in this case) load other libraries that might use Catch for their own unit tests as well.\r\n\r\nWhen the application exits, any libraries loaded by the R interpreter are also unloaded -- that triggers the Catch version destructors, thereby cleaning up the static `libraryVersion` struct. Then, when my application exits, we then attempt to clean up `libraryVersion` once again, and this double-destruct causes a crash in my case.\r\n\r\nThe first destruction on exit:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThread 1 \"rsession\" hit Breakpoint 1, Catch::Version::~Version (this=0x22aae40 <Catch::libraryVersion>, __in_chrg=<optimized out>)\r\n    at ../inst/include/testthat/vendor/catch.h:5489\r\n5489    ../inst/include/testthat/vendor/catch.h: No such file or directory.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThread 1 \"rsession\" hit Breakpoint 1, Catch::Version::~Version (this=0x22aae40 <Catch::libraryVersion>, __in_chrg=<optimized out>)\r\n    at /home/kevin/rstudio/src/cpp/tests/cpp/tests/vendor/catch.hpp:6796\r\n6796        struct Version {\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the two `this` pointers are the same, showing that we're in effect destructing the same struct twice.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this can really be called a Catch bug since it's likely outside of the original envisioned use case, but moving away from having a static version struct would likely help out for cases where multiple versions of Catch are inadvertently
