Originally it didn't exist, and it was created for reporters, and some functionality that used to be defined in the \"test file configuration\" of `catch.hpp`, stopped being so, and somebody complained. For v3 the different model means that you can just include whichever header you want. \r\n\r\nObviously, reaching too far into the internals might mean that they reach back and things break later -- this is also something I haven't quite figured out yet, which parts should definitely be internals, which parts should not, and how to best signal the differences... Especially once we start talking about e.g. `StringRef`, which is definitely an internal type, but also can be used by the user, e.g. when writing custom reporter.\r\n\r\n\r\nad 2: I am leaning towards recommending that customization of built-in reporters is done by copying them out, and changing them as needed. IIRC they are currently `final` in v3, because I want freedom to change them as long as the output is roughly the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nad 1: More changes are planned, namely significant changes to the events that are being reported.\r\n  * I intend to remove the `testGroup*` events. They currently fully overlap with the `testRun*` events, and I do not see a way to make them distinct and useful (in theory, `testGroup` events should distinguish between different filters, but they do not nor could I find a time when they did).\r\n  * I want to introduce new events for individual test case runs. The current `testCase*` events fire only once per `TEST_CASE`, while these would fire once for each path through `TEST_CASE`.\r\n  * I want to remove the implicit sections in `TEST_CASE`.\r\n  * After these are done, I also want to quickly go through the data types involved in the above, and see if some of them could be made more efficient through e.g. `StringRef`, or better ownership.\r\n\r\nThe last is the lowest priority of them, and if I don't have the energy to do it, then 🤷  But the others need to be done, and will change the resulting documentation.\r\n\r\nThere is also some work done on supporting multiple parallel reporters, but I don't remember if that requires changes to the reporter interfaces or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nI actually poked at the event rework during this week, but it turns out that the built-in reporters are, uh, adapted, towards the current non-sensical state, and unraveling the assumptions and dependencies will take a while.
