We haven't had an `IsStreamInsertable` issue for a while.\r\nThat SO answer is interesting. It can't be used as-is as it relies on (quite a few, actually) C++11 features - and Catch (1.x, at least) needs to keep working on pre-C++11 compilers.\r\nBut if the approach there is genuinely better we could do something conditionally (and would also be useful for Catch2 - which will assume C++11).\r\nThe \"genuinely better\" qualification is there because I know from looking at this before that every technique I investigated had one trade-off or another. That was a few years ago and I don't recall seeing anything like this one - so maybe it's better? But I'd like to see it more road tested before I switch it in by default (even for C++11 compilers) as if it has different trade-offs to the current approach then it will break currently working code.\r\n\r\nSo I think a starting point is to include it as an \"opt-in\" alternative.\r\n\r\nIf you're happy to put together a PR for that I'd be grateful. Otherwise I'll try and get to it myself in the near future (but not this week).\r\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/290015985/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1019961641,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTAxOTk2MTY0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/1019961641","actor":{"login":"Predelnik","id":2133957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzM5NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik","html_url":"https://github.com/Predelnik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-29T08:10:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1019961643,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwMTk5NjE2NDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/1019961643","actor":{"login":"Predelnik","id":2133957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzM5NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik","html_url":"https://github.com/Predelnik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-29T08:10:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Predelnik","id":2133957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzM5NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik","html_url":"https://github.com/Predelnik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Predelnik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-02T11:09:43Z","updated_at":"2017-04-02T11:09:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/877","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/877/labels{/name}","comments_url
