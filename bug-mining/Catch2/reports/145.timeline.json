default, Conan uses a branch pattern to identify the stable channel, we could use release tag, e.g. `CONAN_STABLE_BRANCH_PATTERN=v\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+`. So, when a new tag is created, the package will be pushed to Conan remote by Travis build.\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll use the same issue to develop.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/311747388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"uilianries","id":4870173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzAxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4870173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries","html_url":"https://github.com/uilianries","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"memsharded","id":15367152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY3MTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15367152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded","html_url":"https://github.com/memsharded","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memsharded/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-03T21:56:11Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T21:56:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/943","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/943/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/943/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/943/events","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/pull/943","id":239839010,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTI4NDEzOTIw","number":943,"title":"Build

solve the automatic Conan build for each new push, this PR brings a solution by Conan package tools.\r\n\r\nAll about Conan package tools could be found [here](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-package-tools/blob/develop/README.md)\r\n\r\nTravis will run build.py by Docker service. It script calls Conan, that export, build and test your package.  To upload your package after all tests, you must include some environment variables in your Travis settings.  \r\n\r\n```shell\r\nCONAN_UPLOAD: Your Bintray Conan repository. e.g. https://api.bintray.com/conan/philsquared/conan \r\nCONAN_PASSWORD: Your Bintray API Key\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy are they not included in travis.yml?  \r\nTo provide the capability to anyone customize and upload it own package by project fork\r\n\r\nWill this work without these environment variables?\r\nYes. The package will be created and tested in Travis job, but will not be uploaded to Bintray.\r\n\r\nWill all packages be sent to the same channel?\r\nNo. Only tags (vX.X.X) will be pushed to **stable** channel. Otherwise, will ~~be sent to **ci**~~ not be uploaded.\r\n\r\nNow, you should decide if you want to create an organization or use your own name.

Description\r\n1 year after #943 :birthday: I updated that PR creating a new one.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n\r\n- Updated Conan recipe:\r\n  - Removed version from recipe. It will be retrieved from tag name (branch)\r\n  - Add topics to be used on search engine\r\n  - Updated license name to SPDX format\r\n- Moved test package dir to .conan\r\n  - As test_package can be customized I moved to keep root path as clean as possible.\r\n  - Using factorial example to check Conan package\r\n  - Validate license copy\r\n- Build Conan package on Travis CI\r\n  - Add job number 8 using linux + python 3.7\r\n  - Build Conan package for every push\r\n  - Upload Conan package ONLY when matching tag name format\r\n\r\n**What should be done to upload Conan packages after this PR?**\r\n\r\nThe python package Conan Package Tools (CPT) is a helper to build and upload Conan package when some conditions are valid, this includes:\r\n\r\n- [X] create a Bintray account. Already done by Phil: https://bintray.com/philsquared/Catch2\r\n- [x] set `CONAN_PASSWORD` on Travis CI settings (do not forget to set as secret). The password is the Bintray API Key, it can be collect on https://bintray.com/profile/edit, clicking on \"API Key\".\r\n- [X] set `CONAN_USERNAME` to be used on Conan package. By default is configured to **catchorg**, same organization name. The result will be *Catch2/\\<version\\>@catchorg/stable*\r\n- [X] set `CONAN_LOGIN_USERNAME` to be used on Bintray login. By default is  **philsquared**.\r\n- [X] set `CONAN_UPLOAD` to configure remote address where the package might be uploaded. By default is *https://bintray.com/philsquared/Catch2*\r\n\r\nThus the only requirement is `CONAN_PASSWORD` in Travis settings. All other variables are configured as needed.\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issues\r\ncloses #926 \r\ncloses #943 \r\n\r\nAdding some Conan experts to review:\r\n/cc @memsharded @danimtb @Croydon
