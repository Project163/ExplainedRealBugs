This is the simple main.cpp file that doesn't compile:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\nint main() {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompilation command: **g++ -std=c++11 -I. main.cpp**\r\n\r\nThis bug originated in commit 004228efb2ccbd2f69eb443933507012fa82304c where the template parameter name \"SS\" was used. The conflicting define in the Solaris <sys/regset.h> header is this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#define SS              18      /* only stored on a privilege transition */\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaturally, g++ errors out when it encounters a numeric constant instead of a template parameter name: \r\n\r\n```\r\ncatch.hpp:1542:31: error: expected nested-name-specifier before **numeric constant**\r\ntemplate<typename SS, typename TT>\r\n                   ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlatform Info:\r\nOS: Solaris 11.4.0.15.0 i386\r\nCompiler: GCC 7.3.0\r\nCatch Version: e2d863b090f54b648147df1ffd084babc94a5e99\r\n\r\nA PR will be created to fix this issue.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
