The classname element should be constructed in a consistent manner. Based on how jenkins uses the classname attribute, the best fit is to construct the classname attribute from the suite-name and the [#filename] tag. The reason is that Jenkins doesn't care about the <testsuite> hiearchy in the junit xml reports. Instead it displays the results based on the content of the classname attributed loosely parsed as a fully qualified java class name, ie using \".\" to separate packages and class names.\r\n\r\nSee also my comment here: https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/issues/320#issuecomment-304874747","closed_by":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
