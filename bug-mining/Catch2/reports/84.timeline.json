Interestingly, the project I was testing with also uses `throw;` to rethrow exceptions. After replacing each such call with `std::rethrow_exception(std::current_exception());` all tests run through.

I think the problem really is with clang or maybe with the combination of clang and libcxxrt that is being used on FreeBSD.\r\n\r\n**Update 1:** Out of curiosity I build clang's libcxx so that it uses libcxxrt (instead of llvm's libcxxabi or gcc's libsupc++). With this setup I can reproduce the errors on my gentoo linux box.\r\n\r\n**Update 2:** I reported the issue with libcxxrt pathscale/libcxxrt#49.

It looks like in addition to running each of the sections there is one run that goes through neither of the sections. This wasn't the case in Catch 1 and it also works on most systems on Catch 2, but on one system I see test failures because of that. The only difference I can see so far is that failing system is a 32bit Linux, everything else is 64 bit. Maybe I can dig some more, but wanted to raise this here in case somebody has an idea what it could
