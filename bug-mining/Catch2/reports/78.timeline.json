thing I learned through this is how to properly register reporters. What I was doing before was customizing the console reporter, which is harder. What I have now is a completely custom reporter, that I add *in addition to* the built-in console reporter, which allows me to append information in the output after the normal console output. This is the desired behavior in my case, and much better.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, one thing that is severely missing is documentation on reporters, examples of how to implement then, explanations of the interfaces a subclass can implement, and so forth. I think it's important to help teach people the proper way of doing these advanced integrations into Catch.\r\n\r\nI get that reporters have been a bit of a moving target the past few months, but hopefully with 2.0 release line things stabilize enough that reliable documentation can be written. I'd offer to do this, but I'm still struggling to understand fundamentals, so I think someone more knowledgeable on the topic should do it. Either way this is outside the scope of this particular issue.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/344395677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rcdailey","id":1768054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjgwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1768054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey","html_url":"https://github.com/rcdailey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
