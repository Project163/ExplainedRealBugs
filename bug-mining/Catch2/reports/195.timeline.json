would be nice to have some mechanism to reflect the filesystem hierarchy in the structure of tests. \n\nThe purpose is to:\n- Present the project structure in the test list using an attractive tree view - for example:\n  \n  ```\n  util/\n      pack/\n          zlib\n              - Compressing works\n              - Decompressing works\n          lzss\n              - Compressing works\n              - Decompressing works\n              - Unaligned streams are filled with 0\n  ```\n- Simplify searching for things responsible for test failures by having 1:1 test&harr;class relation\n- Establish simple and clear convention for test naming that also solves naming conflicts\n- Ability to intuitively search for tests without knowing them, for example after working on `dir/subdir/important.cc`, relevant tests can be discovered and executed by supplying `dir/subdir/` or `dir*subdir*` as argument\n\nProblems with using existing means to accomplish this:\n1. Tags\n   - Can't present project structure nicely in the `--list`\n   - Cumbersone to tell directories with the same name (`[dir][subdir]`)\n   - Tags in `-l` are printed in order reverse to the declaration order, so instead of `[dir][subdir]`, it shows `[subdir][dir]`\n2. Test names\n   - Cumbersome conflict avoidance, for example to search for tests containing `file` when one has `file/` directory, one needs to look for `*/*file*` or similar (that can fail as well)\n   - Doesn't look pretty in `-l`, can't easily tell typos like one can with `-t`\n   - Feels wrong - we specify two things in one place\n\nSo what else? Rather than supplying third option to `TEST_CASE()` macro, I'm thinking of having special tag syntax such as `[/path]` that should stay backwards compatible with 99.9% of people out there - and the `--list` format could change only if there are any path-like tags in the project.\nOr much simpler - remember `__FILE__` and use it for presentation (`-l` or new switch) and searches.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/400223778","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1190#issuecomment-400223778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1190","id":400223778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDIyMzc3OA==","user":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-26T08:24:08Z","updated_at":"2018-06-26T08:24:08Z","body":"Not necessarily contradicting this, but just to clarify: the intention behind `--list-test-names-only` was to write the tests in a form that is directly consumable by `-f`.

in Catch2 applications has a different behaviour than usually expected.\r\n* --verbose/--verbosity is usually found to increase the output in a normal run for debugging purposes (see eg [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbose_mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbose_mode)). In Catch2, it is used solely to set the level of detail provided by running with --list-*.\r\n* The verbosity level \"quiet\" is not very intuitive: one would expect that normal output is suppressed, eg only errors are printed.\r\n* The command line help string \"set output verbosity\" does not indicate that only --list-* runs are affected, and that normal runs are not.\r\n\r\nPreferably the option could be renamed to something like \"level of detail\" (and \"quiet\" replaced with \"low\"), as an alias not to break the interface. At least the help string should be changed to something like \"set the level of detail for the --list-* options\".\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n--list-test-names-only was removed in https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1190\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2439/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
