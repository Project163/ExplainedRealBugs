However, you can't single-step from there, or even continue; you are stuck at the same source line forever.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by using the instruction `d43e0000` instead of the `d4200000` that is used now. This instruction is generated by the `__builtin_debugtrap()` function, which is also available on i386 and x86_64 and generates the `int $3` instruction there. So a simple fix looks like this (against the `devel` branch):\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/catch2/internal/catch_debugger.hpp b/src/catch2/internal/catch_debugger.hpp\r\nindex c300da72..e3b0a24b 100644\r\n--- a/src/catch2/internal/catch_debugger.hpp\r\n+++ b/src/catch2/internal/catch_debugger.hpp\r\n@@ -16,11 +16,7 @@ namespace Catch {\r\n \r\n #ifdef CATCH_PLATFORM_MAC\r\n \r\n-    #if defined(__i386__) || defined(__x86_64__)\r\n-        #define CATCH_TRAP() __asm__(\"int $3\\n\" : : ) /* NOLINT */\r\n-    #elif defined(__aarch64__)\r\n-        #define CATCH_TRAP()  __asm__(\".inst 0xd4200000\")\r\n-    #endif\r\n+    #define CATCH_TRAP() __builtin_debugtrap()\r\n \r\n #elif defined(CATCH_PLATFORM_IPHONE)\r\n \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n<!-- Fill in any extra information that might be important for your issue. -->\r\n - OS: macOS 12.3.1\r\n - Compiler+version: **Apple clang version 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)**\r\n - Catch version: **v2.13.9** and **v3.0.0-preview5**","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
