For custom matchers the `match` member function is in charge of evaluating the assertion expression, but by the time the `assertionStarting` event is dispatched `match` has already been invoked.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`assertionStarting` should run before custom matchers.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\n```cpp\r\nclass DummyCatchListener : public Catch::EventListenerBase {\r\npublic:\r\n    using Catch::EventListenerBase::EventListenerBase;\r\n\r\n    void assertionStarting(Catch::AssertionInfo const& assertionInfo) override {\r\n        std::cout << assertionInfo.lineInfo.file << \":\" << assertionInfo.lineInfo.line << std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nCATCH_REGISTER_LISTENER(DummyCatchListener)\r\n\r\nclass DummyMatcher : public Catch::Matchers::MatcherBase<int> {\r\npublic:\r\n    bool match(int const& in) const override {\r\n        std::cout << \"match \" << in << std::endl;\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE(\"Dummy\") {\r\n    CHECK_THAT(123, DummyMatcher{});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nmatch 123\r\npath/to/dummy_test.cpp:42\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm trying to use a listener to update global variables to be able to access the current assertion file and line in a custom matcher.
