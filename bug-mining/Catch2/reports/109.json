There's no default implementation as I want to make sure I implement stringifying for all the types I care about.\r\n\r\nI'd like to re-use this for catch stringifying, but currently the only way I see to do that is to specialise `StringMaker` for each type once more and forward the call to `ToStr`, which is a bit awkward.\r\n\r\nCurrently what I'm thinking of doing is just locally modifying catch to replace the final `return unprintableString;` in `EnumStringMaker` with a forwarding call to my `ToStr`, which will achieve what I'm after. I'm wondering though - is there an intended better solution for this? To create a 'catch-all' stringmaker that forwards for all uncaught types. I'm not fussed about whether catch or my function handles basic types like ints/floats/etc so it's fine for me to only forward the unhandled cases.\r\n\r\nIf there isn't a better existing solution, would you be OK with adding this as an upstream feature-macro that could be overridden? E.g. similar in principle to `CATCH_CONFIG_NOSTDOUT` - something like `CATCH_CONFIG_NOUNPRINTABLE` where it expects a function of similar prototype to be defined to print any types that catch doesn't handle built-in and that don't have an existing `StringMaker` specialisation.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
