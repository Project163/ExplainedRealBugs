The crux of the issue is that at some point `rngSeed` was no longer dependency of Catch's main interface, and so the stitching script moved it into non-interface part of Catch. This means that it is only provided in the file that defines `CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER` or `CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN`.\r\n\r\nI will have to check if we promised `Catch::rngSeed` as a part of our external interface, if yes we will move it back.
