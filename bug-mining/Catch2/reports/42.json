This isn't necessarily a bug in Catch itself but I'm curious if anyone has ideas as to how I can try to run this down further.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to generate a minimally reproducible example yet 😞 . Any advice in further narrowing down what could be going on would be hugely appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n\r\n* Catch version: **v1.8.2**\r\n* Operating System: **Ubuntu 16.04 64bit**\r\n* Compiler+version: **gcc 4.8.5**\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
