By this, the `CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR` is set according to my project's PROJECT_NAME.\r\n\r\nI see **three possible solutions:**\r\n  1. not including `GNUInstallDirs` before using Catch2 as a subdirectory\r\n  2. filing bug report for `GNUInstallDirs` because it should update `CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR` for new subprojects\r\n  3. change Catch2's `CMakeLists.txt` to not rely on `GNUInstallDirs`' `CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR`, but install `docs/` to `\"${DATAROOTDIR}/doc/${PROJECT_NAME}\"`; this means changing [L138](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/v2.3.0/CMakeLists.txt#L138) to\r\n```\r\n# Install documentation\r\nif(CATCH_INSTALL_DOCS)\r\n  install(\r\n    DIRECTORY\r\n      docs/\r\n

exporting a library dependent on `rapidfuzz`, CMake reports the following error:\r\n`CMake Error: install(EXPORT \"fooTargs\" ...) includes target \"foo\" which requires target \"rapidfuzz\" that is not in any export set.`\r\n\r\nIt seems that the error results from missing exports in `rapidfuzz`.\r\n\r\n`rapidfuzz` indeed has export statements in `CMakeLists.txt`. However, these statements are covered in `if(NOT SUBPROJECT)` clauses, which get shadowed when used as a subproject, leading to the above error.\r\n\r\nThe fix should be easy - just remove the `if` around exports, but I'm not sure whether that would introduce other problems.\r\n\r\nTo replicate the issue, create a `foo.cc`, a `cmake/fooConfig.cmake.in` just like `rapidfuzz/cmake/rapidfuzzConfig.cmake.in`, and the following `CMakeLists.txt` which does no more than declaring `foo`'s dependency on `rapidfuzz` and exporting `foo`:\r\n\r\n```cmake\r\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)\r\nproject(foo LANGUAGES CXX VERSION 0.0.1)\r\n\r\n# Import rapidfuzz and set project dependency\r\nadd_subdirectory(rapidfuzz-cpp)\r\nadd_library(foo foo.cc)\r\nadd_library(foo::foo ALIAS foo)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(foo rapidfuzz)\r\n\r\n# Everything below is boilerplate for exporting, just like `rapidfuzz-cpp/CMakeLists.txt`\r\nset(FOO_CMAKE_CONFIG_DESTINATION \"${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/foo\")\r\ninstall(TARGETS foo EXPORT fooTargs DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR})\r\ninstall(EXPORT fooTargs NAMESPACE foo:: DESTINATION ${FOO_CMAKE_CONFIG_DESTINATION})\r\n\r\nconfigure_package_config_file(\r\n    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/cmake/${PROJECT_NAME}Config.cmake.in\r\n    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}Config.cmake\r\n    INSTALL_DESTINATION ${FOO_CMAKE_CONFIG_DESTINATION}\r\n)\r\nwrite_basic_package_version_file(\r\n    \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}ConfigVersion.cmake\"\r\n    COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion\r\n)\r\n\r\ninstall(\r\n    FILES\r\n    \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}Config.cmake\"\r\n    \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}ConfigVersion.cmake\"\r\n    DESTINATION\r\n    ${FOO_CMAKE_CONFIG_DESTINATION}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeleting `if` around `rapidfuzz`'s exports works for this simple example.\r\n\r\nA palliative solution without changing `rapidfuzz` is to simply move the `project(FOO)` statement after `add_directory(rapidfuzz)`, after which  `rapidfuzz` would perceive itself as the main project and therefore exporting it.

pull request comes as a way to make sure users including argparse through FetchContent or through a direct add_subdirectory() call won't have argparse tests built or the argparse install commands configured by default.\r\n\r\nConcerning not using the cmake provided [PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL.html) variable, PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL is not used because it has a required minimum cmake version of 3.21 while argparse uses a minimum cmake version of 3.12.4. \r\n\r\nThis approach is largely based on the way [Catch2 handles this same condition (Lines 5-9)](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/CMakeLists.txt) in their CMakeLists.txt, as well as [this issue](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1373) which references to glitchy installs when setting install targets in a subdirectory CMake structure.\r\n\r\nWhile the user will have to use FetchContent after their project call, this is also how the [official PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL handles detecting subdirectory projects](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL.html), so I don't see this as much of a concern. \r\n\r\nAlso, I removed the manual setting of ARGPARSE_BUILD_TESTS and ARGPARSE_BUILD_SAMPLES from the FetchContent section of the README, as they are not necessary as ARGPARSE_BUILD_SAMPLES defaults to OFF and test building will now not be run if argparse is not the top level project.\r\n\r\nARGPARSE_BUILD_SAMPLES was also officially declared as an option, as well as initialized to OFF to maintain previous behavior.
