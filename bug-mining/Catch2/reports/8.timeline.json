Naturally, being software, it's not perfect, but I've found it (c)makes my life a lot easier when dealing with projects where I need multiple builds (be they cross-platform, or configurations, or whatever). You may (or may not) find it useful.\n\nAmongst other things, it can generate GNU makefiles, NMake makefiles, XCode/VS/Eclipse/KDevelop/(and some other) format project files, if you like that kind of thing. For the projects I use it for, we typically consider the CMake files to be the \"canonical\" build file, rather than the generated files. (To be clear, about 97.83% of my usage is to generate makefiles - personally, I rarely use the various \"project\" files, since I live in Emacs - but I've also got folks on my team using various flavours of VS, Eclipse etc who are happy with the results)\n\nI read on the internet that CMake's output is \"garbage\" - but I find it works well enough for me. And I'm not the only one.\n\nBut I'm _really_ not interested in debating the pros and cons of the myriad makefile generators out there, so I'll leave it at that.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/67346421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PureAbstract","id":1790029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTAwMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1790029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract","html_url":"https://github.com/PureAbstract","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PureAbstract/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":209032528,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA5MDMyNTI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/209032528","actor":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-17T16:15:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":209032529,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwOTAzMjUyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/209032529","actor":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-17T16:15:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/67363869","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/348#issuecomment-67363869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/348","id":67363869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MzYzODY5","user":{"login":"refi64","id":1690697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1690697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64","html_url":"https://github.com/refi64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refi64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-17T17:58:49Z","updat
