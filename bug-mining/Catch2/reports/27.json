Trying try build catch (unified 1.7.1) with \"-fno-rtti\" results in:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncatch.hpp: In member function ‘Catch::Totals Catch::RunContext::runTest(const Catch::TestCase&)’:\r\ncatch.hpp:6385:60: error: ‘dynamic_cast’ not permitted with -fno-rtti\r\n                 dynamic_cast<SectionTracker&>( rootTracker ).addInitialFilters( m_config->getSectionsToRun() );\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can't mix \"-fno-rtti\" and \"-frtti\" code. g++ defaults to RTTI, and my project disables it with \"-fno-rtti\". Catch won't build with \"-fno-rtti\" because of the dynamic_cast. Looking at issue #648 it looks like dynamic_cast was removed but recently readded elsewhere with new code.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
