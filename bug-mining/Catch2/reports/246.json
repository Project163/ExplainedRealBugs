The time (duration) values have the wrong format. The error message is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: The file '<path>\\TestResults-Scintilla.xml' is an invalid file.\r\nWARNING: At line 3 of file:/<path>/TestResults-Scintilla.xml:cvc-pattern-valid: Wert '0.022408' ist nicht Facet-gültig in Bezug auf Muster '(([0-9]{0,3},)*[0-9]{3}|[0-9]{0,3})*(\\.[0-9]{0,3})?' für Typ 'SUREFIRE_TIME'.\r\nWARNING: At line 3 of file:/<path>/TestResults-Scintilla.xml:cvc-attribute.3: Wert '0.022408' des Attributs 'time' bei Element 'testsuite' hat keinen gültigen Typ 'SUREFIRE_TIME'.\r\nERROR: Step ‘Publish xUnit test result report’ failed: The result file '<path>\\TestResults-Scintilla.xml' for the metric 'JUnit' is not valid. The result file has been skipped.\r\n```\r\nIt seems that it expects time values only with 3 decimal digits, but the generated file contains 6.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nGenerate a report which is parsed correctly by the xUnit / JUnit plugin.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nIn a jenkins build, build and invoke a Catch2 test executable with options `-r junit -o someReportFile.xml`. Configure the job with the xUnit Test publisher and JUnit report source referencing `someReportFile.xml`.\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - Compiler+version: MSVC 16.28 (Visual Studio 2019)\r\n - Catch version: 2.0.1 (from https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/code/ci/0d68633e33ce996a83a7ff640da74e1c6fd1459b/tree/test/unit/catch.hpp)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
