Catch2 honor the environment variable TEST_RANDOM_SEED only when --rng-seed is not provided on the command line.\r\nPreserve precedence: CLI (--rng-seed) > environment (TEST_RANDOM_SEED) > default generation (time/random device).\r\nAdd a SelfTest that verifies both behaviors and update Approval baselines accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhy\r\nRequested in #3021 to enable Bazel/CI workflows that supply the seed via env var, while still letting developers override it explicitly with --rng-seed.\r\n\r\nHow\r\nIn Session::runInternal, read TEST_RANDOM_SEED and set m_configData.rngSeed iff the CLI did not specify a seed.\r\nParse the env seed as unsigned decimal; ignore the env var if it is missing or malformed.\r\nAdd tests/SelfTest/BazelEnvSeed.tests.cpp:\r\nIf TEST_RANDOM_SEED is not set: test logs a SUCCEED message and exits (so Approvals can run without per-machine env noise).\r\nIf TEST_RANDOM_SEED is set: asserts that reporter prints the same seed and that cfg->rngSeed() matches it.\r\nWith env set and --rng-seed 42: asserts reporter shows 42 (CLI wins).\r\nRegister the test in tests/CMakeLists.txt (BazelEnvSeedTest) and update Approval baselines to account for one extra test case in outputs.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nNo public API changes, no amalgamated files modified.\r\nMinimal, localized changes; no measurable perf impact.\r\n\r\nGitHub Issues\r\nImplements the request in #3021\r\nIf acceptable, this PR closes #3021.\r\n\r\nChanged files (summary)\r\nsrc/catch2/catch_session.cpp — apply env seed when CLI seed absent.\r\n(Aux plumbing where applicable to carry seed through unchanged.)\r\ntests/SelfTest/BazelEnvSeed.tests.cpp — new SelfTest (with license header).\r\ntests/CMakeLists.txt — add source and BazelEnvSeedTest + (optional) CLI-override test.\r\ntests/SelfTest/Baselines/* — approvals updated for the new test case.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nctest basic preset: ✅\r\nBazelEnvSeedTest:\r\nSelfTest \"[bazel-seed]\" → passes (no env set).\r\nTEST_RANDOM_SEED=777 SelfTest \"[bazel-seed]\" → prints Randomness seeded to: 777 and matches config.\r\nTEST_RANDOM_SEED=777 SelfTest \"[bazel-seed]\" --rng-seed 42 → prints 42 (CLI precedence).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/3024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/3024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/3281554621","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/3021#issuecomment-3281554621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/3021","id":3281554621,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA2rM7DmIy9","user":{"login":"aryanrahar","id":222013219,"node_id":"U_kgDODTunIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/222013219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar","html_url":"https://github.com/aryanrahar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aryanrahar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-11T15:51:31Z","updated_at":"2025-09-11T15:52:13Z","body":"can
