When I try to execute my benchmark, the test program displays nothing and runs indefinitely, as if it was in an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nInvestigating a bit further, the problem have to do with estimateClockResolution() in catch_timer.cpp. This method takes a very, very, very long time to return a result.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nThis is only relevant for bug reports, but if you do have one,\r\nplease provide a minimal set of steps to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nUsually this means providing a small and self-contained code using Catch\r\nand specifying compiler flags/tools used if relevant.\r\n-->\r\nI just compiled this code on Windows 10, with TMD-GCC 5.1 :\r\n\r\n```CPP\r\nTEST_CASE(\"whatever\") {\r\n    Catch::getEstimatedClockResolution();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand I got the behaviour I explained before.\r\n\r\nSo I looked in the source code and I extracted the critical section, adding some prints to see what's going on :\r\n```CPP\r\nTEST_CASE(\"whatever\") {\r\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\r\n\t\tuint64_t ticks;\r\n\t\tuint64_t baseTicks = Catch::getCurrentNanosecondsSinceEpoch();\r\n\t\tstd::cout << baseTicks << std::endl;\r\n\t\tdo {\r\n\t\t\tticks = Catch::getCurrentNanosecondsSinceEpoch();\r\n\t\t} while (ticks == baseTicks);\r\n\t\tstd::cout << ticks << std::endl;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI got the following output :\r\n```\r\n1522549011516507900\r\n1522549011517508200\r\n1522549011517508200\r\n1522549011518510100\r\n1522549011518510100\r\n1522549011519510000\r\n1522549011519510000\r\n...\r\n```\r\nMy resolution seems awful, and thus the estimation takes way too much time. Works well on Visual studio though, I have this output :\r\n```\r\n3470278496901559\r\n3470278497438427\r\n3470278497653964\r\n3470278497868317\r\n3470278498082275\r\n3470278498319523\r\n3470278498539007\r\n3470278498762834\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggested solution\r\n\r\nPut a time limit to Catch::estimateClockResolution ?\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n<!--\r\nFill in any extra information that might be important for your issue.\r\n\r\nIf your issue is a bugreport, definitely fill out at least the following.\r\n-->\r\n* Catch version: v2.2.1\r\n* Operating System: Windows 10\r\n* Compiler+version: TMD-GCC 5.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
