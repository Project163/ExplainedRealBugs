When I try run test with filter by this generated section, catch2 seems to run test in a loop indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what is the correct behavior here, but I doubt that infinite loop is expected.\r\nIf this is an illegal usage of generators and sections, perhaps it should be explicitly documented and/or an error should be generated.\r\nIdeally I'd expect it to be able to filter by this dynamic generated section.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\nTest case:\r\n```\r\nTEST_CASE( \"generate_cond_section\" )\r\n{\r\n    bool fov = GENERATE( false, true );\r\n    DYNAMIC_SECTION( \"fov_\" << fov ) {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run without filter by section:\r\n```\r\n$ tests/test  \"generate_cond_section\"\r\nStarting the actual test at Tue Sep 15 17:59:40 2020\r\nFilters: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: fov_0\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: fov_1\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n===============================================================================\r\ntest cases: 1 | 1 passed\r\nassertions: - none -\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run with filter by section:\r\n```\r\n$ tests/test  \"generate_cond_section\" -c fov_0\r\nStarting the actual test at Tue Sep 15 18:00:55 2020\r\nFilters: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: fov_0\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n0.000 s: generate_cond_section\r\n....\r\n^C\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n<!-- Fill in any extra information that might be important for your issue. -->\r\n - OS: MacOS 10.14\r\n - Compiler+version: **Apple LLVM version 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)**\r\n - Catch version: **v2.13.0**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'm exploring my options to somehow \"name\" the values generated using the `GENERATE`, so I can run test for the specific combination of generated values.
