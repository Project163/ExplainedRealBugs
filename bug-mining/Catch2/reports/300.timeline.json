The closest the order comes to being relevant is that I think having negative matches at the end is more readable.\r\n\r\n> Commas:\r\n\r\nYes, commas are generally an OR, and it doesn't matter whether they are between tags, exact name, wildcarded name, or an AND-joined filter.\r\n\r\n> Combination of multiple arguments:\r\n\r\nTechnically this is not an OR, but rather successively applied filters. Some CLI utilities provide these, but I don't like them much in practice. The actual rules are that\r\n\r\n* without positive filters, all non-hidden tests are included by default\r\n* with positive filters, all tests that match them are included\r\n* matching with any negative filter disqualifies the test from being included\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/1694673286/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10233762663,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA2rM5vV6W4zwAAAAJh-tNn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/10233762663","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"2a19ae16b87547f152f262e05a55c7b2b969807b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/2a19ae16b87547f152f262e05a55c7b2b969807b","created_at":"2023-08-30T14:19:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11644587945,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM5vV6W4zwAAAAK2Ek-p","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/11644587945","actor":{"login":"nicramage","id":6319714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTk3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6319714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage","html_url":"https://github.com/nicramage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2a19ae16b87547f152f262e05a55c7b2b969807b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicramage/Catch2/commits/2a19ae16b87547f152f262e05a55c7b2b969807b","created_at":"2024-01-30T16:40:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
