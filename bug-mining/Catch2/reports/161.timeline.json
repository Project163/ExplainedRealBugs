the bug**\r\n\r\nUsing a toolchain which targets the homebrew gcc8.3 on MacOS causes the following failure when building the Catch2 project:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn file included from /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/sys/sysctl.h:83,\r\n                 from /Users/richardhodges/github/QuoineFinancial/Catch2-1/include/internal/catch_debugger.cpp:21:\r\n/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/sys/ucred.h:94:2: error: '_Atomic' does not name a type\r\n  _Atomic u_long          cr_ref;  /* reference count */\r\n  ^~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nA successful compile\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir build\r\n$ cd build\r\n$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${HOME}/github/ruslo/polly/gcc-8-cxx17.cmake ..\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe toolchain file can be located here: https://github.com/ruslo/polly/blob/master/gcc-8-cxx17.cmake\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n - OS: MacOS Mojave 10.14.4\r\n - Compiler+version: GCC 8.3 (homebrew)\r\n - Catch version: 2.7.0 and 2.5.0 both exhibit the problem\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe problem is in catch_debugger.cpp. Because the system is detected as MacOS, the following code is compiled...\r\n\r\n```\r\n#ifdef CATCH_PLATFORM_MAC\r\n\r\n#  include <assert.h>\r\n#  include <stdbool.h>\r\n#  include <sys/types.h>\r\n#  include <unistd.h>\r\n#  include <sys/sysctl.h>\r\n#  include <cstddef>\r\n#  include <ostream>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`sysctl.h` is including `ucred.h`, which references the nonstandard (in c++) `_Atomic` keyword which gcc does not support (and clang does).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where to go from here. GCC has marked this issue as WONTFIX as they claim there is no need to support nonstandard keywords in gcc.\r\n\r\nThis issue did not occur on previous versions of MacOS.
