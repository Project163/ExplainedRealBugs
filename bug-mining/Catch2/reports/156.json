I ended up writing something that creates a std::vector, where I extract each element individually for the test case.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I'm aware the random generator is not a good implementation. Just used here for illustrative purposes.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntemplate<typename Container, size_t NUM_ELEMENTS=1>\r\nclass RandomValuesGenerator : public Catch::Generators::IGenerator<Container>\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n\tusing value_type = typename Container::value_type;\r\n\tRandomValuesGenerator()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t_current_value.resize(NUM_ELEMENTS);\r\n\t\tstatic_cast<void>(next());\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tContainer const& get( ) const override\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn _current_value;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tbool next() override\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tfor (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_ELEMENTS; i++)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t_current_value[i] = value_type ( 1e3 * (drand48() - 0.5) );\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\nprivate:\r\n\tContainer _current_value;\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Convenience function for creating a Catch2 generator for producing random numbers\r\ntemplate<typename Container, size_t NUM_ELEMENTS=1>\r\nstatic Catch::Generators::GeneratorWrapper<Container> randomValues() {\r\n\treturn Catch::Generators::GeneratorWrapper<Container>(\r\n\t\tstd::unique_ptr<Catch::Generators::IGenerator<Container> >(\r\n            new RandomValuesGenerator<Container, NUM_ELEMENTS>()));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere I call the code like so:\r\n```\r\nTEST_CASE(\"someTest\") {\r\n    const int numTrials = 10;\r\n    auto values = GENERATE(take(numTrials, randomValues<std::vector<float>, 4>()));\r\n    float a = values[0]; CAPTURE(a);\r\n    float b = values[1]; CAPTURE(b);\r\n    float c = values[2]; CAPTURE(c);\r\n    float d = values[3]; CAPTURE(d);\r\n\r\n    SECTION(\"Section1\") {\r\n        SECTION(\"SubSection 1.1\") { ... }\r\n        SECTION(\"SubSection 1.2\") { ... }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere it will generate n-tuples of random numbers to be used in the various subsection tests below.\r\nI imagine there should be a better/easier way to do this as I really just want to set up the number of trials I want to do, and have any number of local variables pull digits from the generator.  E.g. I feel like I shouldn't have to tell it to use a std::vector just to extract values from it into separate variables.\r\n\r\nE.g. something like\r\n```\r\nTEST_CASE(\"Ideal\") {\r\n    int numTrials = 100;\r\n    int numVars = 4;\r\n    auto generator = GENERATE(take(numTrials*numVars, randomFloats());\r\n    float a = generator.get();\r\n    float b = generator.get();\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this?","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1538/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
