If your package manager does not provide Catch2 package (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 does provide Catch as `catch` but only in version 1.2.0), and you have enough rights to install Catch2 globally, you can do this:\r\n> \r\n> ```shell\r\n> $ git clone https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git\r\n> $ cd Catch2\r\n> $ cmake -Bbuild -H. -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF\r\n> $ sudo cmake --build build/ --target install \r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> If you don't want to install Catch2 globally, you will need to read up on [`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html) and [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) (specifically the part about `PATHS` argument).\r\n\r\nInstalling this way still did not allow me to build cppzmq successfully with the package visible in /usr/local on my Mac.  Is there some way to watch cmake resolve dependencies that would show what directories it's looking in?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/898575558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"greggwon","id":3497254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTcyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3497254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon","html_url":"https://github.com/greggwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12686901820,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM4Ve9J5zwAAAAL0MsI8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/12686901820","actor":{"login":"vadz","id":146917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjkxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz","html_url":"https://github.com/vadz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9e6d7bbf004b13860f468298e21221575df9f2a6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vadz/Catch/commits/9e6d7bbf004b13860f468298e21221575df9f2a6","created_at":"2024-05-02T17:32:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/2561844298","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1383#issuecomment-2561844298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1383","id":2561844298,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA2rM6YsqRK","user":{"login":"d7dsem","id":120548847,"node_id":"U_kgDOBy9t7w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120548847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem","html_url":"https://github.com/d7dsem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d7dsem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-25T11:17:33Z","updated_at":"2024-12-25T11:21:32Z","body":"I am try to use in it on Windows\r\n\r\nAnd some steps doesn't have sens to me. \r\n\r\nFor example \"install on system\" (i think its some like add some folder to PATH variable?
