When compiling I get the following errors (amongst others):\r\n```\r\nerror C3861: 'AddVectoredExceptionHandler': identifier not found\r\nerror C3861: 'SetThreadStackGuarantee': identifier not found\r\nerror C3861: 'RemoveVectoredExceptionHandler': identifier not found\r\nerror C3861: 'SetThreadStackGuarantee': identifier not found\r\nerror C3861: 'GetStdHandle': identifier not found\r\nerror C2065: 'CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO': undeclared identifier\r\n```\r\nIt would seem that UWP does not supply these classes.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Using VS2017 create a new UWP App\r\n    _File -> New Project -> Installed -> Visual C++ -> Windows Universal ->DirectX 11 App (Universal Windows)_\r\n2. Add _catch.hpp_ to the project\r\n3. Include the header\r\n```c\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\n```\r\n4. Compile\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n\r\n* Catch version: **v1.9.6** also tried **v2.0.0-develop.3**\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1020/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
