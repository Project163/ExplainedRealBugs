The non-light colors in Win32 Console are all very dim and boring. Hence, you already use the bright green and bright red. I wonder if you could also use bright yellow for warnings. You use Colour::Yellow for warnings and reconstructed expressions. I have no opinion about whether reconstructed expressions should be yellow or bright yellow.\r\n\r\nSince I would like to use bright yellow in my reporter, I would already be happy if you added Colour::BrightYellow.\r\n\r\nAlso, it took me a while to understand that there are no colors when a debugger is active. I found --use-color, but I don't understand why color and the debugger could harm each other.
