Description\r\nWe have a handful of tags we use mainly for excluding tests (tests that shouldn't run on certain platforms, or tests which require some external component like a database or access to a GPU, for example), which means we often run our test executables with one or more tags excluded, and the `[.]` tag does not play well with this.\r\n\r\nIf I exclude tests that shouldn't run on Windows, all hidden tests suddenly spring to life, meaning that just by excluding a tag, I actually add *more* tests to be run, which is counter-intuitive, and makes the `[.]` tag useless in many cases.\r\n\r\nAs an example, say you have the following tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTEST_CASE(\"A\", \"[.][foo]\");\r\nTEST_CASE(\"B\", \"[.][bar]\");\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Running the test executable with no arguments will run zero tests.\r\n- Running it with `[foo]` will run test A\r\n- Running it with `~[foo]` will run test B (even though it was hidden, and all we're doing is excluding tests to stop them being run)\r\n- Running with `~[baz]` causes both tests to be run (as above, all we did was exclude a tag, and suddenly we're running more tests than we got when we excluded nothing)\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I'd like to propose one of two things:\r\n\r\n- strengthen the semantics of `[.]` so that a hidden test is now only run if one of its tags are positively included (so if a test is tagged `[.foo],`  then `~[bar]` will no longer match it.\r\n- alternatively, add a new \"strong hide\" instruction tag (perhaps `[:]`), with the above semantics, but without changing the behavior of `[.]`\r\n\r\nThe first solution is obviously the simpler one (and I feel, makes `[.]` behave in a much more intuitive manner), but it is a change in behavior, so perhaps the second option would be preferable?\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to submit a pull request, but I'm not sure which solution (if any) you'd prefer.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1184/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
