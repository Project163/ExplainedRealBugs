At present, the precision for float and double are hard-coded within Catch2 to 5 and 10, respectively:\r\n```cpp\r\nstd::string StringMaker<float>::convert(float value) {\r\n    return fpToString(value, 5) + 'f';\r\n}\r\nstd::string StringMaker<double>::convert(double value) {\r\n    return fpToString(value, 10);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSometimes things will fail (even with `Approx()`), but the precision of the failure message doesn't show enough precision to be meaningful.\r\n```\r\nprog.cc:22: FAILED:\r\n  REQUIRE( TestType(0) == std::numeric_limits<TestType>::epsilon() )\r\nwith expansion:\r\n  0.0f == 0.0f\r\n```\r\nThe proposal here is to add a `setPrecision()` function to allow the user to control this. I have prototyped this, which you can see running [live on Wandbox](https://wandbox.org/permlink/mZXPLEuET5ZeTg1t). Here's the test:\r\n```cpp\r\nTEMPLATE_TEST_CASE( \"Double, double, toil and trouble\", \"[double]\", float, double ) \r\n{\r\n    const auto precision = GENERATE( -1, 0, 3, std::numeric_limits<TestType>::max_digits10 );\r\n\r\n    if( precision >= 0 )\r\n    {\r\n        Catch::StringMaker<TestType>::setPrecision( precision );\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // Expected to fail to demonstrate the problem\r\n    REQUIRE( TestType(0) == std::numeric_limits<TestType>::epsilon() ); \r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe output shows as expected for floats and doubles. For instance:\r\n```\r\nprog.cc:15: FAILED:\r\n  REQUIRE( TestType(0) == std::numeric_limits<TestType>::epsilon() )\r\nwith expansion:\r\n  0.0f == 0.000000119f\r\n```\r\nMaking a unit test for this is a little iffy since the actual string values are dependent on the usual floating-point fuzziness. I guess it could compare string length without looking too closely at the value.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
