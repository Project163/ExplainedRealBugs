It's not supported by any version of GCC; I tested that with both `gcc version 4.7.3 (Gentoo 4.7.3-r1 p1.4, pie-0.5.5)` and `gcc version 4.10.0 20140423 (experimental) (GCC)`.\n\nLooking at that the changes the commit introduced, it seems that the author assumes `throw()` to be equivalent with the new `noexcept` which is **not** the case, see e.g. the articles on [cppreference.com](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec) and [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12833241/difference-between-c03-throw-specifier-c11-noexcept).\n\nSince `throw()` is deprecated in C++11 now one could think of removing it altogether.\n","closed_by":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
