Sometimes it's necessary and proper to use a namespace directive (like for UDLs), but it has to be done carefully. The namespace being imported must be carefully controlled, like `std::literals` or `std::placeholders` or `std::rel_ops`, AND the using directive should be confined to an appropriately small scope.\r\n\r\nEven the clang-tidy check allows them, but only for specially blessed namespaces. I think this shows an unwarranted bias towards treating the standard library as special. What about all the other libraries in the world that define UDLs, like `fmt::literals`?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang-tools-extra/blob/master/clang-tidy/google/UsingNamespaceDirectiveCheck.cpp#L38\r\n\r\nIn the case of the `Catch::Generators`, I think it would be nice if there was a special namespace with JUST generator names designed for importing, containing only a few using decls. All implementation details should be in another namespace. This is good hygiene and will help with your IDE UI problem.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/553554527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BillyDonahue","id":8611652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MTE2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8611652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue","html_url":"https://github.com/BillyDonahue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyDonahue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/553559838","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1799#issuecomment-553559838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1799","id":553559838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzU1OTgzOA==","user":{"login":"michaelvlach","id":11575751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTc1NzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11575751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelvlach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelvlach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T19:24:37Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T19:24:57Z","body":"I mostly agree although my (personal) issue with `using namespace x;` is that it loses information about where does the particular symbol come from. I would even like it better if Catch2 opted to have those names in `catch` namespace rather than nested in `catch::generators` and then imported for \"convenience\". Consider\r\n```\r\nconst auto data = GENERATE(as<std::string>{}, \"Hello\", \"World\", \"!\");\r\n```\r\nvs hypothetical:\r\n```\r\nconst auto data = GENERATE(catch::as<std::string>{}, \"Hello\", \"World\", \"!\");\r\n```\r\nYeah I may have saved 7 key strokes in the first case but now readers of the code will wonder if the `as` is my thing or Catch2 thing or wherever it comes from.
