That makes a parser fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nExample:\r\n`\r\nTEST_CASE(\"Single printf Test\")\r\n{\r\n\tprintf(\"Test with a %s \\n\", \"printf\");\r\n}\r\n`\r\nrunning \r\n`testcase.exe -r junit > out.txt`\r\nresults in:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<testsuitesTest with a printf \r\n>\r\n  <testsuite name=\"SingleTestCase.exe\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"0\" tests=\"0\" hostname=\"tbd\" time=\"0\" timestamp=\"2018-04-05T09:00:27Z\">\r\n    <system-out/>\r\n    <system-err/>\r\n  </testsuite>\r\n</testsuites>\r\n```\r\nUsing std::cout works fine and the output lands in the system-out section. \r\nRunning with -o out.txt then the printf output doesn't appear in the file and the XML is ok. The output is only shown on the screen.\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n\r\n* Catch version: v2.1.2\r\n* Operating System: win10\r\n* Compiler+version: gcc 7.3\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
