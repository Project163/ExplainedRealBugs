Description\r\nThis PR changes behaviour of `--list-*` flags so that if output target is provided via `-o` flag, the resulting listing is written to that target, rather than to stdout, like it was in v2.\r\n\r\nThere is also a bunch of internal changes and refactorings to enable this feature, and to make future implementation of multiple reporters simpler.\r\n\r\n## GitHub
