I managed to reproduce this issue as well, but on a newer distro, and much older catch version:\r\n\r\n**OS:** Ubuntu 21.10\r\n**Compiler+version:** GCC 11.2.0\r\n**Catch version:** v2.13\r\n\r\nIt has nothing to do with the version, but seemingly with the compiler version\r\n\r\nthe issue is that the value of MINSIGSTKSZ stops being hardcoded after a certain version of GCC, and begins to actually query the value using the syscall `sysconf`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26040470/145392978-15831d6e-ec9d-4a71-8a2c-d1ded2d46d33.png)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that catch2 uses that macro when initializing constexpr which is in compile time, now that it calls a syscall it can only be discovered in runtime, so the fix is very simple: removing `constexpr` and use `static const inline` instead.\r\n\r\nThen what will happen is that we are allocating an \"alt signal stack\" memory that is just a plain old array which takes said constexpr that does not work anymore, but it can no longer be evaluated because we cannot determine the value in compile time anymore.\r\n\r\nthe solution to that line is to allocate the memory in a dynamic container, like a vector:\r\n\r\n` std::vector<char> FatalConditionHandler::altStackMem(sigStackSize, {});`\r\n\r\nAnd then every other use of it needs to be fixed..\r\n\r\nI'd contribute but I have no idea how to.\r\n\r\nEither that, or to cease using MINSIGSTKSZ and begin assuming the size.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/989790693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ASmoliak","id":26040470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDQwNDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26040470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak","html_url":"https://github.com/ASmoliak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASmoliak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/991042465","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2326#issuecomment-991042465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2326","id":991042465,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA2rM47Ehuh","user":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-10T14:59:26Z","updated_at":"2021-12-10T14:59:26Z","body":"@ASmoliak It is a libc version thing, but yes.
