This is due to wrong path during `catch2.pc.tmp` `configure_file` step. Reverting commit `7cad6d7` fixes the issue.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nConfigure, build and install procedure should succeed without any special configuration\n\n**Reproduction steps**\nOn Windows, in Catch2 repository, perform:\n```\ncmake -B build -DCATCH_INSTALL_EXTRAS=OFF -DCATCH_INSTALL_DOCS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=bin -DCMAKE_UNITY_BUILD=ON\ncmake --build build --config Release\ncmake --install build\n```\nLast command prints out the following error:\n```\nCMake Error: Could not open file for write in copy operation /C:/Users/Michal/code/Catch2/bin/share/pkgconfig/catch2.pc.tmp\nCMake Error: : System Error: Invalid argument\nCMake Error at build/cmake_install.cmake:77 (configure_file):\n  configure_file Problem configuring file\n```\nNotice a slash before a drive letter, causing the path to be invalid.\n\n\n**Platform information:**\nTested on Windows 11 and `windows-latest` Azure Pipelines agent\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/3019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/3019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
