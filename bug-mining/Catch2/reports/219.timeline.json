After playing around with it, I am not sure how happy I am with how the tests look vs how they run.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that while the simple case makes sense, and the following runs 3 assertions\r\n```cpp\r\nTEST_CASE() {\r\n    SECTION(\"first\") { SUCCEED(); }\r\n    int _ = GENERATE(1, 2);\r\n    SECTION(\"second\") { SUCCEED(); }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nnesting this further can make the result quite confusing. Even though I just implemented the feature, I had to draw a diagram to figure out why the code below reports 14 assertions.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nTEST_CASE(\"#1938 - mixed sections and generates\") {\r\n    auto i = GENERATE(1, 2);\r\n    SECTION(\"A\") {\r\n        SUCCEED(\"A\");\r\n    }\r\n    auto j = GENERATE(3, 4);\r\n    SECTION(\"B\") {\r\n        SUCCEED(\"B\");\r\n    }\r\n    auto k = GENERATE(5, 6);\r\n    CAPTURE(i, j, k);\r\n    SUCCEED();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nSo, the way I see it, there are 3 possibilities here\r\n1. Keep the status quo, document that `GENERATE` cannot follow a `SECTION` at the same level, and strengthen the check from an assert, to make sure it fires in Release mode as well as in Debug mode.\r\n2. Make `GENERATE` a _virtual section_. This would provide the desired behaviour for the first example, at the cost of less obvious behaviour in more complex examples. \r\n3. Make `GENERATE` only interact with their parent `SECTION`/`TEST_CASE` to have it run multiple times. This would make it so that the first example reports 4 assertions (each `SECTION` would be run twice), and the second example would report 32 asserts (8 elements in generators * 2 sections * 2 asserts in each run).\r\n\r\nI will have to think about which one I prefer.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/653802011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/657068221","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1938#issuecomment-657068221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1938","id":657068221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzA2ODIyMQ==","user":{"login":"sdutoit","id":819177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTE3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/819177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit","html_url":"https://github.com/sdutoit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdutoit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-11T14:05:30Z","updated_at":"2020-07-11T14:06:25Z","body":"What you have there (I think described as case 2) seems totally expected to me.
