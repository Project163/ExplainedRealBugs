Not saying that it can't be specified in a reasonable way - just that it needs some thought.\r\n\r\nThe behavior I would intuitively expect would basically be that if the filter contains at least one positive pattern, then the hide flag is ignored (since the filter will only match if the positive pattern part of it also matches, and so we can bring the test out of hiding). In other words:\r\n\r\n- `[x]~[y]`: include tests if they have `[x]` and do not have `[y]`, regardless of whether they're hidden (because they're pulled in by the inclusion of the `[x]` tag)\r\n- `[x],~[y]`: include tests if they have the `[x]` tag, regardless of whether they're hidden. Also include tests that do not have `[y]`, but only if they are not hidden.\r\n\r\nThat could be implemented just by making exclusion patterns only ever match if the test case is not hidden, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/include/internal/catch_test_spec.cpp b/include/internal/catch_test_spec.cpp\r\nindex d9c149d5..afa61693 100644\r\n--- a/include/internal/catch_test_spec.cpp\r\n+++

the bug**\r\nMy Catch2 tests include some benchmarks (tests with tag `[!benchmark]`). These are (correctly) not run when I invoke my executable `./test` which instead runs all my other non-benchmark tests.\r\nHowever, when I include the `exclude:` command-line arg, e.g..\r\n```bash\r\n./test exclude:sometest\r\n```\r\nthen all tests except `sometest` are correctly run, but the benchmarks are *also* incorrectly run.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSince the benchmarks are not run when `./test` is run, they should also not be run when `./test exclude:sometest` is run.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nA MWE (`test.cpp`):\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_BENCHMARKING\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE( \"a\", \"[mytests]\") {\r\n    REQUIRE( true );\r\n}\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE( b\", \"[mytests]\") {\r\n    REQUIRE( true );\r\n}\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE( c\", \"[!benchmark]\") {\r\n    \r\n    BENCHMARK( \"mybenchmark\" ) {\r\n\r\n        int s=0;\r\n        for (int i=0; i<10; i++)\r\n            s++;\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCompile with \r\n```bash\r\ng++ -std=c++14 -c test.cpp -o test\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `./test` is run, only tests `a` and `b` run (correct behaviour).\r\nWhen `./test except:a` is run, `b` runs (correctly), but `c` incorrectly also runs.\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18\r\n - Compiler+version: **GCC v8.3.0**\r\n - Catch version: **v2.10.0**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1829/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3887059230,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg4NzA1OTIzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/3887059230","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-16T15:49:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
