It shouldn't be out of bounds as the character at `size()` should be a null - although I suspect that the standard allows for the implementation to throw if asked for it (would need to check that).\r\nI suspect that making it `<` is the right thing to do. The reason I don't sound 100% certain is that there does seem to be handling for null elsewhere and I'd need to check it's not relying on that (and if it is probably change it).\r\nSo I'll take a closer look soon.\r\nHave you actually had an issue with it, or did you just spot it
