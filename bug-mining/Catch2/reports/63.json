I just started porting across my code from Boost.Test[1] and got stuck with what is most likely a trivial issue: checking the contents of an exception message. I checked the issues and found #563 - a similar problem, pointing to `CATCH_CHECK_THROWS_WITH`. However, my code is relying on user defined predicates to perform the matches[2]. Is it possible to do something similar to this with catch? i.e.:\n\n```\nbool is_critical( my_exception const& ex ) { return ex.m_error_code < 0; }\n...\nBOOST_CHECK_EXCEPTION( some_func(1), my_exception, is_critical );\n```\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that I can also check additional information supplied by Boost.Exception and also make fuzzier checks on the message string (rather than just equality).\n\nMany thanks for your time.\n\nMarco\n\n[1] http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html\n[2] \nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/utf_reference/testing_tool_ref/assertion_boost_level_exception.html\n","closed_by":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/641/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/641/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
