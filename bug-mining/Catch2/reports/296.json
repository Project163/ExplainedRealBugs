I understand it's much simpler to generate a `if` for each SECTION, but if it would be great if we could find a way to tell the static analyzer that a single section is active at the same time. For example, maybe all the booleans are in a bitfield and we assert that a single bit is set. Generating else if/switch-case would work, but I cannot think of a way to make it work with just SECTION. We discussed the idea of adding DECLARE_SECTIONS(name1, name2, ...) to add an assert to help the static analyzer. I'm creating this issue without any clear solution in mind, but more to brainstorm if we have any idea for a solution.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
