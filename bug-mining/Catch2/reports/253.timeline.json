Description\r\n### What\r\nCatch2 incorrectly registers for SIGSEGV and other signals on Windows. The correct behavior is to register as the top-level unhandled exception filter so that it is notified last after the application has had an opportunity to handle the exception and after the debugger has been notified. The previous behavior was to register a vectored exception handler which results in Catch2 being notified prior to the application being able to handle the exception.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nVisual Studio 2022 uses structured exceptions to implement address sanitization (/fsanitize=address). This issue results in Catch2 being incompatible with a key bug-finding feature of VS 2022. \r\n\r\n## GitHub Issues\r\nCloses #2332 \r\n\r\n## Notes for maintainers\r\nI didn't see any Windows-specific tests and I am unsure how to validate the new behavior in the CI/CD pipeline. I manually verified the change fixes the issue but would prefer to add a new test to the CI/CD pipeline if possible.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Alan Jowett <alanjo@microsoft.com>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2334/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5837311997,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA2rM5AZEn6zwAAAAFb7k_9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/5837311997","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-03T21:50:33Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5837312217,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM5AZEn6zwAAAAFb7lDZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/5837312217","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"98a6c69e1e429a86140301dfa5563b1d7263e813","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/98a6c69e1e429a86140301dfa5563b1d7263e813","created_at":"2022-01-03T21:50:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11670283914,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM5AZEn6zwAAAAK3mmaK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/11670283914","actor":{"login":"nicramage","id":6319714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTk3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6319714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage","html_url":"https://github.com/nicramage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicramage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a7cfbfc1c33a8d17d5a4f1a183f271f95195907e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nicramage/Catch2/commits/a7cfbfc1c33a8d17d5a4f1a183f271f95195907e","created_at":"2024-02-01T13:39:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
