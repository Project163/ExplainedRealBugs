Emscripten based targets).  We turned on exceptions for Catch, but it slows down the compile times, and the runtime immensely.   I appreciate the cleanliness of the API, but a set/longjump approach when exceptions are off would open this unit test framework up to more codebase.  There doesn't appear to be a way to only enable exceptions on the unit test cpp files.

"body":"Apparently Google Test also aborts the test during an assert if Exceptions are disabled.\r\nWe follow a similar approach in our application by using a custom test reporter that will abort the test as soon as an assert comes up.\r\n\r\nWe just need to override:\r\n    `bool assertionEnded(Catch::AssertionStats const& assertionStats)`\r\n\r\nThe nice thing is that it allows you to print any information you want about the assertion before exiting.\r\nIt's not optimal but still usable (and requires no changes on Catch).\r\n\r\nTo avoid compilation errors with `-fno-exceptions`, we `#define CATCH_CONFIG_FAST_COMPILE`, which gets rid of the try/catch blocks and allows compilation to succeed.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/404863263/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fschuh","id":12468976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDY4OTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12468976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh","html_url":"https://github.com/fschuh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschuh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/409190249","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/703#issuecomment-409190249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/703","id":409190249,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTE5MDI0OQ==","user":{"login":"TorstenRobitzki","id":2026114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2026114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki","html_url":"https://github.com/TorstenRobitzki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorstenRobitzki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-31T11:39:22Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T11:39:22Z","body":"@fschuh
