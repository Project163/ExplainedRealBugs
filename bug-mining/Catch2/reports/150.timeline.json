Description\r\nThis PR fixes #1394.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t figure out how to properly create, filter and run a test case from within a test case, so instead of adding tests for the situation described in #1394 to `SelfTest`, I created the following:\r\n\r\n1. A test file which contains some sections that should and shouldn’t be executed, as well as a mechanism to detect whether the “outer instructions” have been called twice. You can find it at `examples/300-FilteredSection.cpp`.\r\n2. A shell script that calls the test file in such a way that it triggers the issue. You can find it at `examples/runFilteredSection.sh`.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps too, but I’d be super curious to learn how to do it the right way.\r\n\r\n## GitHub
