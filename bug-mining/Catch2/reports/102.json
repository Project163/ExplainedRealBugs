With the right combination of switches this will be caught by `catch(...)`. In this circumstance `std::current_exception` returns nullptr. The translators rethrow the nullptr causing a bad_exception. My fix is shown below. I believe this applies to all Windows structured exceptions but I'm a bit rusty on the details.\r\n\r\n     std::string ExceptionTranslatorRegistry::translateActiveException() const {\r\n        try {\r\n    #ifdef __OBJC__\r\n            // In Objective-C try objective-c exceptions first\r\n            @try {\r\n                return tryTranslators();\r\n            }\r\n            @catch (NSException *exception) {\r\n                return Catch::Detail::stringify( [exception description] );\r\n            }\r\n    #else\r\n            // Windows SEH exceptions caught in native code will have no current_exception\r\n            if (std::current_exception() == nullptr)\r\n                return \"Non C++ exception\";\r\n\r\n            return tryTranslators();\r\n    #endif\r\n        }\r\n\r\n* Catch version: **2.0.1**\r\n* Operating System: **Windows 10**\r\n* Compiler+version: **MSVC 15.5.2**\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
