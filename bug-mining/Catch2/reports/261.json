After some googling, I found out about the `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` variable, and added \r\n`list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH \"${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/third_party/catch2/contrib\")` in my top level `CMakeLists.txt` after the `add_subdirectory(third_party/catch2)` command.\r\n\r\nAfter this process, I can now run `cmake ..` as expected. It would be good to add this documentation into the part of the docs that describes integration with CMake. I would submit a PR myself, but I'm new to C++ and CMake and not confident that this wasn't a self-inflicted error, or I did something else wrong.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nUsing Ubuntu 18.04, g++-8, c++17\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1805/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
