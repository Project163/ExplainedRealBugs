I should add something to the docs about that.\nIt is, indeed, the `&&` (`||` would have the same effect).\nFor `&&` @kirbyfan64's approach seems best.\n`||` is a little trickier, but is seldom useful.\n\nThe reason for this limitation is that Catch decomposes the expression, then must reconstruct it so it can evaluate whether it was successful or not. While it is decomposed it can capture the values of the LHS and RHS of the expression for reporting purposes. If you introduce`&&` (or `||`) into the expression it is no longer a simple, binary, expression. Splitting the expression up (@kirbyfan64's approach), or wrapping in parentheses (thereby losing the LHS/ RHS reporting capability) are the usual ways to deal with

has 214 open \"Issues\" on github.\n\nNothing wrong with that per se, but going through the list I note that many of them could be either closed or marked as feature request. \n\nI'd like to share my Impression with Phil so he can maybe save some time dealing with the Issues.\n\nThe following Issues have been resolved (fixed or declined) and can be closed, but the ticket is still open:\n#665, #620, #600, #584, #574, #573, #572, #560, #525. Maybe also #593, #590, #565, not sure.\n\nThe following remind me of support requests. They could be closed with a hint to ask the forum if the question is still relevant: #671, #666, #632, #621, #612, #607, #603, #576, #569, #567, #552, #547, #542, #539, #536, #531, #529, #522, #516, #515.\n\nThen there are a lot of feature requests. This shows that people like using Catch, and would like it even better if it supported just one more feature. It is of course completely up to Phil how to deal with these. If I were in his place, I would close the ones that are not on my roadmap, saying so, and label the remaining ones as feature requests, if this is supported by the github bug tracker, so they do not count as open bugs. These are: (Performance:) #668, #556, (Output:) #664, #663, #639, #638, #613, (TestingTools:) #652, #651, #642, #641, (Test Runner:) #645, #629, #622, (Cosmetic:) #610, #609, #601, (Esoteric:) #644, #640, #611, #605, #589, (Other:) #582, #558, #553.\n\nThis here is caused by bugs in third-party software and can be closed in the catch Bug Tracker: #661.\n\nThese bugs show up when using outdated or exotic compilers or targets. They could be closed, stating that Catch does not target these compilers / platforms: #674, #649, #594, #583, #579, #575, #543.\n\nI would classify the following bugs to have a low priority, as they are unlikely to affect the main function of catch (perform tests reliably:) #625 (output), #617 (cosmetic), #615 (const correctness), #586 (debugger support), #578 (language lawyer case).\n\nSome of the following have been mentioned above, some not. I find their info relevant enough to test the respective situation myself with the compiler and platform that I intend to use before committing to use Catch myself: #649, #602, #594, #593, #590, #583, #579, #575, #543,\n#574 causes me to add a coding standard rule that testing objects with custom (&&,||,!) operators (which I cannot envision why I would have that) inside Catch macros is not permitted.\n\nOh, I only got as far back as #515. Not sure if I will continue, or chose another unit testing library.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/675/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":932928456,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDkzMjkyODQ1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/932928456","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-23T14:57:11Z","label":{"name":"Working as intended","color":"006b75"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":941846798,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTQxODQ2Nzk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/941846798","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"c97ada1910d149dc811b29073685ffc26e750cec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/c97ada1910d149dc811b29073685ffc26e750cec","created_at":"2017-01-30T18:42:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/943856336","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/621#issuecomment-943856336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/621","id":943856336,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA2rM44QhrQ","user":{"login":"mattfbacon","id":58113890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTEzODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58113890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon","html_url":"https://github.com/mattfbacon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattfbacon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T00:13:11Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T00:13:11Z","body":"@tamboril, this doesn't work.
