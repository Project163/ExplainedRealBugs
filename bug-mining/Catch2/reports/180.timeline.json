The various knobs on it (`margin`,\r\n`epsilon`, `scale`) then change how wide the target is, but wideness\r\nof the target does not change based on the value the `Approx` instance\r\nis compared to.\r\n\r\nThis is expected to be less surprising to people with only a fuzzy\r\nunderstanding of comparing floating point values. Consider\r\n`Approx(10).epsilon(0.1)`. This says that you are aiming for `10`,\r\ngive or take 10%. In other words, the interval `[9, 11]` (luckily\r\nfloats/doubles can represent both of those exactly, so the set is\r\ncrisp). This interval notably does not include 11.1, but if you apply\r\nthe epsilon to bigger of the two numbers, then 10 and 11.1 are\r\nwithin 10% of each other.\r\n\r\nIf you want something that is scale and order independent, you can\r\nuse the `WithinULP` matcher.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/536216483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/537572883","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1746#issuecomment-537572883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1746","id":537572883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzU3Mjg4Mw==","user":{"login":"paulfloyd","id":17177100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTc3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17177100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd","html_url":"https://github.com/paulfloyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulfloyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-02T16:26:42Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T16:26:42Z","body":"This is disappointing.

a floating-point matcher similar to [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.isclose.html)'s and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.isclose.html)'s `isclose`, testing `abs(a - b) <= (atol + rtol * abs(b))`\r\nwith the same defaults `rtol=1e-05, atol=1e-08`\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n`isclose` is useful for matching a floating-point value to a target reference floating-point value and is a de-facto standard. It would be useful to be able to make the equivalent comparisons in Catch2 out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe matcher would behave similar to `Approx`. However, referencing `Approx`'s [issues](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/comparing-floating-point-numbers.md#approx):\r\n- _All internal computation is done in `double`s, leading to slightly different results if the inputs were floats:_ In the new matcher we can just avoid this issue.\r\n- _`Approx`'s relative margin comparison is not symmetric:_ This is not an issue, but the desired behavior for this matcher. (the [existing matchers](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/comparing-floating-point-numbers.md#floating-point-matchers) are OK when symmetrical behavior is [desired](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1746)).\r\n- _By default, `Approx` only uses relative margin comparison. This means that `Approx(0) == X` only passes for `X == 0`:_ This is avoided with the default values.\r\n- `Approx` is not a matcher\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11998469972,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM4dQ88YzwAAAALLKh9U","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/11998469972","actor":{"login":"uilianries","id":4870173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzAxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4870173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries","html_url":"https://github.com/uilianries","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d2d418a9cbda255e193c4ed6c57cdf20137fa309","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uilianries/Catch2/commits/d2d418a9cbda255e193c4ed6c57cdf20137fa309","created_at":"2024-03-04T12:40:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
