Following vectors are size 0.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe first (and all following) vectors should be size 0.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\n```c++\r\nTEST_CASE(\"chunks\") {\r\n  auto vector = GENERATE(take(5, chunk(0, value(1))));\r\n  REQUIRE(vector.size() == 0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n<!-- Fill in any extra information that might be important for your issue. -->\r\n - OS: **Linux 5.1.15-arch1-1-ARCH**\r\n - Compiler+version: **g++ (GCC) 9.1.0**\r\n - Catch version: **Catch v2.7.2** ([it looks like the bug still exists though](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/54089c4c8c657ffb13d8f3a1425403335af5ba4d/include/internal/catch_generators_generic.hpp#L208-L209))\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nMy specific use-case in which I ran into this is a test like this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nTEST_CASE(\"my function\") {\r\n  auto size = GENERATE(0, 1, 2, 3);\r\n  auto vector = GENERATE_COPY(take(1, chunk(size, random(-100, 100))));\r\n\r\n  auto list = VectorToList(vector);\r\n  \r\n  REQUIRE(list.size() == size);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the intended behaviour was to return a minimum chunk-size of 1 for all chunks, but I think it would make much more sense to return empty vectors, otherwise the use-case above would be more annoying to write.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
