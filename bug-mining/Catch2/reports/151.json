That calls `Colour::use(Colour::Code)` -> `IColourImpl::use(Colour::Code)`. `PosixColourImpl::setColour` then retrieves the stream via `Catch::cout()`, which is wrong.\r\n\r\nIMHO the cleanest solution is that the `Colour` RAII guard takes the stream, but that requires modifying all the reporters, even external (could be defaulted, but that would keep the code wrong unnoticed). \r\nAlternatively retrieve the stream in `setColour` via `getCurrentContext().getConfig()->stream()`, which is much simpler, but I don't know if it could have any side effects.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1502/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
