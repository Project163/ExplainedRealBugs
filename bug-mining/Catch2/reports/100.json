If the intent is that CHECK and REQUIRE behave like a C++ if () statement (which seems logical) then this can be fixed pretty simply by explicitly casting to bool in compareEqual, compareNotEqual, and the relational operators in ExprLhs. If it helps, an example of the kind of operator that causes the failure is here: https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/blob/master/source/numeric/SVInt.h#L421\r\n\r\nNote that this previously worked in Catch 1.x and broke when I upgraded to Catch 2.1. I have a fix locally (6 line change, file is viewable here: https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/blob/master/external/Catch/catch.hpp ) If it would be helpful to you I could turn that into a pull request.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
