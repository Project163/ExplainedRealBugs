Edited:\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nIf you have a test case that had a hidden tag specified as `[.foo]`, in the past, you could specify it on the executable as in:\r\n\r\n`./program [.foo]`\r\n\r\nHowever, now it reports no matching test. Other forms of specifying the tag do work, such as:\r\n\r\n`./program [.]`\r\n`./program [foo]`\r\n\r\nIn much older versions, I think the last one here actually _hadn't_ worked, though.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`./program [.foo]` should launch the hidden `[.foo]` (or `[.][foo]`) test case, as in some previous versions of Catch.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nUsing `catch.hpp` v2.10.2.\r\nCreate `foo.cpp`:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN\r\n\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE(\"Test\", \"[.foo]\") {\r\n\r\n  REQUIRE(true);\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompiling and testing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ g++ --std=c++11 foo.cpp -o foo\r\n$ ls\r\ncatch.hpp  foo  foo.cpp\r\n$ ./foo\r\n===============================================================================\r\nNo tests ran\r\n\r\n$ ./foo [.]\r\nFilters: [.]\r\n===============================================================================\r\nAll tests passed (1 assertion in 1 test case)\r\n\r\n$ ./foo [foo]\r\nFilters: [foo]\r\n===============================================================================\r\nAll tests passed (1 assertion in 1 test case)\r\n\r\n$ ./foo [.foo]\r\nFilters: [.foo]\r\nNo test cases matched '[.foo]'\r\n===============================================================================\r\nNo tests ran\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n - OS: **Linux**\r\n - Compiler+version: **g++ 5.4.0 and/or 7.2, clang 3.8**\r\n - Catch version: **v2.10.2**\r\n\r\nUsed to work as expected in Catch version v2.2.3.","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1798/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
