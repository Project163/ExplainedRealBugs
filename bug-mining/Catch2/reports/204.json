It triggers with any template argument (not just `int`).\r\n\r\nThe warning message:\r\n```\r\nadding 'int' to a string doees not append to the string\r\n```\r\nSuggested fix:\r\n```\r\nuse array indexing to silence this warning\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTEMPLATE_TEST_CASE does not generate `-Wstring-plus-int` warning.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\n1. Use clang or clang-tidy.\r\n2. Compile either [TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE example](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/test-cases-and-sections.md#type-parametrised-test-cases) -OR- following minimal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTEMPLATE_TEST_CASE(\"\", \"\", int)\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n - OS: **Windows 10**\r\n - Compiler+version: **clang9, clang-tidy9**\r\n - Catch version: **v1.2.10**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI cannot pinpoint the exact location in the code that triggers this because the warning stack exceeds its limits for macro expansions but I reckon people familiar with the Catch2 internals would have a good idea what might be the issue that triggers this.\r\n\r\nIt will be something like `\"mystring\" + 1` or somesuch. And the fix is to advance address of the string, not the string itself, e.g. `&\"mystring\"[1]`.\r\n\r\nSee live demo: https://godbolt.org/z/TkaTSV","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1806/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
