Create a minimal CMakeLists.txt:\r\n```\r\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)\r\n\r\nproject(MyCustomProject)\r\n\r\ninclude(GNUInstallDirs)\r\n\r\nadd_subdirectory(vendor/Catch2)\r\n\r\nadd_executable(my_setup_test tests/my_setup_test.cpp)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(my_setup_test Catch2::Catch2)\r\n```\r\n2. download Catch2 into `vendor/`:\r\n```\r\nmkdir vendor && cd vendor && git clone https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2 && cd ..\r\n```\r\n3. create minimal test in `tests/my_setup_test.cpp`:\r\n```\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN\r\n#include <catch2/catch.hpp>\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE(\"Test Setup\") {\r\n  REQUIRE(1 + 1 == 2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Build and install\r\n```\r\nCMAKE=cmake\r\n\r\n$CMAKE -E make_directory build &&\r\n$CMAKE -E chdir build $CMAKE .. &&\r\n$CMAKE --build build -- -j8 &&\r\n$CMAKE --build build --target install -- DESTDIR=..\r\n```\r\n5. View the installed directory structure:\r\n```\r\ntree usr\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n* Catch version: **v2.3.0**\r\n* Operating System: **Debian (GNU/Linux) testing**\r\n* Compiler+version: **g++ (Debian 8.2.0-4) 8.2.0**\r\n* cmake version 3.12.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
