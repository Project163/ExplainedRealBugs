Revised description\r\n\r\nReplacing the first version of this PR (which had the weakness, as @horenmar correctly noted, that it would cause any header files placed in the excluded dirs to be left out of the install), this version... well, at least it isn't susceptible to **that**.\r\n\r\nYou may **HATE** this, and I'd completely understand, but the only thing I can say is that I've tested it heavily, it works perfectly, and the resulting install is identical to the old one _except_ for the lack of empty directories.\r\n\r\nThere is one new caveat. Because it makes heavy use of the `cmake_path()` command, it only works in CMake 3.20+. (It does a version check, and the old globbed install command is still there and will be used if the CMake version is too old.)\r\n\r\nWith CMake 3.20+, though, it takes a completely different approach.\r\n\r\nThere are ample comments in the (added) source, so I won't talk it up any more as it's easier to just read the code. There are also `message(DEBUG)` commands scattered throughout, for now, so if you run `cmake` with the `--log-level=DEBUG` flag you can watch it process every header file, which might help build confidence in the logic.\r\n\r\nLogic which, again, **I'm** very confident in, myself... but I also recognize that it's an awfully complex method of installing a bunch of header files, and I would completely accept a reaction along the lines of, \"Oh, hell no!\" :rofl: \r\n\r\n## GitHub Issues\r\nFixes
