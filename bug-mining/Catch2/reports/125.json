Description\r\n\r\nWe have our own custom string class that overloads the << operator, and it's causing issues when using the REQUIRE macro and compiling under Clang in Linux.\r\n\r\nThe REQUIRE line looks like this:\r\n\r\nREQUIRE(str1 == \"Item1\");\r\n\r\nThe error we get is the following:\r\n\r\n19>project_path\\catch.hpp(810,21): error : use of overloaded operator '<<' is ambiguous (with operand types 'Catch::ReusableStringStream' and 'const MyCustomStringClass<char>')\r\n19>                rss << value;\r\n19>                ~~~ ^  ~~~~~\r\n19>project_path\\catch.hpp(829,114): note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'Catch::StringMaker<type, void>::convert<MyCustomStringClass<char> >' requested here\r\n19>            return ::Catch::StringMaker<typename

\"Item1\");\r\n\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n  Disabling stringification with CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_STRINGIFICATION does not help solve this issue.\r\n\r\n   Commenting out the following line in catch.hpp fixes the compilation error:\r\n   This code starts in line 801:\r\n\r\n    template <typename T, typename = void>\r\n    struct StringMaker {\r\n        template <typename Fake = T>\r\n        static\r\n        typename std::enable_if<::Catch::Detail::IsStreamInsertable<Fake>::value, std::string>::type\r\n            convert(const Fake& value) {\r\n                ReusableStringStream rss;\r\n\r\n                // this line causes the problem\r\n                // rss << value;\r\n\r\n                return rss.str();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n* Catch version: **v2.2.2**\r\n* Operating System: **Linux**\r\n* Compiler+version:
