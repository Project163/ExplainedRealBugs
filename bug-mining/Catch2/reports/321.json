Run \"cmake --help-policy CMP0148\" for policy details.  Use\r\n  the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.\r\n\r\nThis warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/actions/runs/6679314592/job/18151308282#step:3:26\r\n\r\nCI shows this warning as well.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor there to be no `(dev)` warnings when configuring.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI believe the fix is to use the `FindPython` module which has a particular component for the Python interpreter. This was added in CMake 3.12 yet the trunk branch currently only requires CMake 3.10. Raising the minimum CMake version would be reasonable and is unlikely to affect any users other than those still on Ubuntu 18 which by default ships 3.10.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ChrisThrasher","id":39244355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjQ0MzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39244355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisThrasher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2755/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
