Description\r\nCMake adds an architecture check to each package by default. This causes the package to break if e. g. the package was built on a 32 bit system and used on a 64 bit system, even though this is a header-only library. This can happen if a caching package manager like conan is being used.\r\n\r\nIn CMake 3.14 this check can be disabled by passing `ARCH_INDEPENDENT` to `write_basic_package_version_file`. In versions prior to that `CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` needs to be unset for the duration of this function.\r\n\r\n## GitHub

PR\r\n* adds an interface library target `Clara`, aliased `Clara::Clara`\r\n* corresponding `install` entries are also added\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  clara-install-prefix/\r\n  |-- include\r\n  |   `-- clara.hpp\r\n  `-- lib\r\n      `-- cmake\r\n          `-- Clara\r\n              |-- ClaraConfig.cmake\r\n              `-- ClaraConfigVersion.cmake\r\n  ```\r\n  so `find_package(Clara REQUIRED)`
