This evaluates to true, if `| actual - target | < margin` holds, so the question boils down to what is the margin like. There are 2 potential sources of margin in Approx, an absolute value set via call to `setMargin`, which defaults to 0, and a relative value that is currently computed as `ε * | target |`. However, lets consider instead consider `ε * max( |target| , |actual| )` in this example.\r\n\r\nBy setting `target` to `0` and simplifying the above expressions, we get `| actual | < ε * | actual |`... For this to evaluate to true, `ε > 1` has to hold, which breaks any semblance of sanity in comparisons for other cases (because it would also mean that e.g. `10 == Approx(20)`).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/439681680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1973148115,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5NzMxNDgxMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/1973148115","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-18T10:16:50Z","label":{"name":"Not a bug","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/439711509","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1444#issuecomment-439711509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1444","id":439711509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTcxMTUwOQ==","user":{"login":"karyon","id":1891915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTE5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1891915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon","html_url":"https://github.com/karyon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-18T17:47:57Z","updated_at":"2018-11-18T17:47:57Z","body":"I think I do understand the math and the fundamental problem.

I hope to add another point of view in the following, if I'm just repeating what has already been said then I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to either add a special case for zero, using some reasonably guesstimated fixed epsilon in that case, simply to create a practical solution for an annoyance in a common case (comparing to zero). A more elaborate rationale would be that when comparing to `Approx(<very small number>)`, chances are that the \"scale\" of the calculation was indeed very small (i.e. using only very small numbers), so using an even smaller epsilon is fine. However, when comparing to `Approx(0.0)`, chances are that the calculation was actually done at a non-zero scale, since most calculations are not just about zeroes (right? :) ), and applying an epsilon of zero does not help in that case.\r\n\r\nAlternatively I would suggest to add a minimum epsilon to the calculated one to not let the applied epsilon become ridiculously small for small numbers and ultimately zero, or in other words, to use `min(ε * max( |target| , |actual| ), minimum_ε)` or perhaps `ε * max( |target| , |actual| ) + minimum_ε` (which would be equivalent of setting the existing scale variable to some minimum_ε i think?). again, the rationale could be that the calculations are always happening at *some* scale that is not zero.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/439711509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"karyon","id":1891915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTE5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1891915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon","html_url":"https://github.com/karyon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karyon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/439720149","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1444#issuecomment-439720149","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1444","id":439720149,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTcyMDE0OQ==","user":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-18T19:48:26Z","updated_at":"2018-11-18T19:48:26Z","body":"The problem with setting a minimum ε is that it also leads to unintuitive, and what is worse, incorrect, results. Let's say that we set minimum ε to `std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon`, which is the difference between 1 and the next smallest representable value, or roughly `2.2e-16`. This sounds good, until you realise that while this seems insanely small, there are still `4372995238176751615` (4*10^18) numbers between 0 and `std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon`... \r\n\r\nAlso, `Approx` actually used to have `scale` default to `1.0`, but that lead to false positives in code such as `REQUIRE(1e-14 == Approx(1e-15).epsilon(0.01))`, which is obviously incorrect (1e-14 is not within 1% of 1e-15), but would pass because the scale would blow out the actual numbers used in the comparison. That and some other similar problems made me ultimately decide to go for the mathematically more correct comparison, even though it is possibly surprising.

The problem isn't the zero point, it's the fact that floating-point numbers near zero (over 8 million values) are denormalized. For these values, the exponent and mantissa are mixed together. Particularly around zero, there's a danger of advertising one approach as the right one. In this particular case, where you're testing around a fixed value, an epsilon value can make sense (though not a thoughtlessly chosen one). An ULP comparison ends up being equivalent, again, due to the fixed comparison point. However, there's a huge relative leap from the smallest positive value to zero to the largest negative value. In addition, a sign-change here could mean a clear error that should be flagged.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, I'd prefer the following example code, as it's much simpler, vastly more clear, and does not depend on the reader having memorized the underlying current implementation of Catch2's `Approx()` helper:\r\n\r\n```\r\nREQUIRE (x > 0)\r\nREQUIRE (x <
