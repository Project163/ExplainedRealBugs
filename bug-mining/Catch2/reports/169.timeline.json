type_safe is installed with CMake the standard way (such as `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --install build`,  the generated type_safe-config-version.cmake file contains the following lines :\r\n```\r\n# if the installed project requested no architecture check, don't perform the check\r\nif(\"FALSE\")\r\n  return()\r\nendif()\r\n\r\n# if the installed or the using project don't have

for a 32 bit target).\r\nBecause type_safe is header-only, it is arch independent, and this should be enforced in CMakeLists.txt.\r\nThere are two ways to achieve this goal :\r\n### Before CMake 3.14\r\nAdding `set(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P \"\")` before `write_basic_package_version_file` in CMakeLists.txt, line 113.\r\nhttps://github.com/foonathan/type_safe/blob/e9da2dcaeb58c40dcadd1bfaa629b4202a666068/CMakeLists.txt#L113-L117\r\nSee [this similar issue](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1660) for more details.\r\n\r\n### After (and including) CMake 3.14\r\nCMake provide an `ARCH_INDEPENDENT` argument to add to `write_basic_package_version_file`. \r\nDocumentation is available here : https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.14/module/CMakePackageConfigHelpers.html#command:write_basic_package_version_file.\r\nOur function will look like this : \r\n```\r\nwrite_basic_package_version_file(\r\n  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/type_safe-config-version.cmake\r\n  VERSION 0.2.2\r\n  COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion\r\n  ARCH_INDEPENDENT\r\n)\r\n```\r\nand the resulting type_safe-config-version-file.cmake will now contains :\r\n```\r\n# if the installed project requested no architecture check, don't perform the check\r\nif(\"TRUE\")\r\n  return()\r\nendif()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/foonathan/type_safe/issues/136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/foonathan/type_safe/issues/136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11998469428,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM4bPXyszwAAAALLKh00","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/11998469428","actor":{"login":"uilianries","id":4870173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzAxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4870173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries","html_url":"https://github.com/uilianries","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"33286fdc37f52a5fbc1bdf38545137005b377703","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uilianries/Catch2/commits/33286fdc37f52a5fbc1bdf38545137005b377703","created_at":"2024-03-04T12:40:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
