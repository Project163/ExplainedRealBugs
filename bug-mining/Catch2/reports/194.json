This is quite incorrect behavior on any Unix operating system. A non-zero exit code indicates the program could not perform its intended function. It is reasonable for a tool that runs the program to assume that something went wrong with listing tests, and indeed, I'm using Catch in a framework that assumes exactly that. Furthermore, exit codes above 128 are supposed to have special meaning, and the exit code may not exceed 255. See here, for example:\r\nhttps://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exit-status.html\r\n\r\nPlease fix this to have the test runner exit 0 if there is, in fact, no error.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nSimply build and run any catch unit test with \"-l\" or \"--list-test-names-only\".\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n* Catch version: v2.4.1\r\n* Operating System: Linux\r\n* Compiler+version: GCC 5.4\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1410/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
