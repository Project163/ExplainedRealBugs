suggestion feels like a Catch::Matchers::Vector::Equals<T> but for\nspan instead of vector.\n\nI believe the Catch convention for something like this (following Vector's\nprecedent) would be Catch::Matchers::*Span*::Equals<T>.\n\nI wouldn't want to use the term \"ElementsAre\" here, because it's doing\nsomething significantly different from Googletest's ElementsAre.\nThat Googletest function takes a sequence of element matchers and returns a\npolymorphic matcher that can match any kind of sequence container for an\nelement-wise match against those element matchers.\nhttps://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/cheat_sheet.md#container-matchers\n\nI feel it's wasteful for Catch2 to require a different variant of Equals\nfor each kind of sequence container, and that the Catch::Matchers::Vector\nnamespace is a useful first draft that should be generalized. Instead of\ncreating an Equals for each container type (vector, span, array, many\nmore), we would be better off making a Catch::Matcher::Sequence::Equals\ntemplate that can produce an element-wise Equals matcher for any sequence\ntype.\n\nA sequence can be considered logically \"equal\" to an expected sequence and\nstill be of different type. This keeps the test author from having to\ncreate a specific container type just to specify expectations. The test\nauthor should be able to do that very concisely with a std::initializer\nlist, vector, or array, let's say.\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 30, 2019 at 4:33 PM Tom Hulton-Harrop

Billy,\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nFor some context, my matcher was just a quick experiment to try and help port some existing tests I had from Google Test to Catch2. I like the Hamcrest style naming of `ElementsAre` which is why I was following that convention.\r\n\r\nI actually wound up moving away from the `ElementsAreSpan` type and wrote another version called `ElementsAreSubscript` which will work on any type so long as it provides the subscript `[]` operator.\r\n\r\nI've combined this with `gsl::span` so in the matcher you have one templated type `T` with the subscript operator and the range to check against is a `gsl::span` (for example in my case I have a vector3 type and a number of array/span values to check against).\r\n\r\nYou could take this one step further and have two templated types that can both be subscripted but unfortunately, usage gets more complicated with template deductions where you have to wind up manually specifying both types which can be a bit of a pain...\r\n\r\nSo at the moment, I have code that looks like this\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconstexpr real_t x_axis[] = { 1.0f, 0.0f };\r\nCHECK_THAT(make_span(x_axis), make_elements_sub(as::vec2::axis_x(), 2)); // function to avoid needing ctad - naming isn't great :P\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas it could look like this...\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconstexpr real_t x_axis[] = { 1.0f, 1.0f };\r\nauto matcher = make_elements_sub<vec2_t, decltype(x_axis)>(as::vec2::axis_x(), 2); // must be initialized outside CHECK_THAT otherwise you get compile errors about too many arguments provided to function-like macro invocation\r\nCHECK_THAT(x_axis, matcher);\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut it doesn't look that great either...\r\n\r\nDo you have an example of what you had in mind? I'd be happy to port my code over to something more idiomatic.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nTom","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/533904901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pr0g","id":1136625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzY2MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1136625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g","html_url":"https://github.com/pr0g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3041452989,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMwNDE0NTI5ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/3041452989","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"17c4b2d0932ba944743b3c1e578352080af8c137","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/17c4b2d0932ba944743b3c1e578352080af8c137","created_at":"2020-02-16T10:19:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/586692610","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1307#issuecomment-586692610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1307","id":586692610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjY5MjYxMA==","user":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-16T10:56:35Z","updated_at":"2020-02-16T10:56:35Z","body":"This
