The return value (22) is not checked and the `std::tm` struct is left with `-1` values for everything. When calling `strftime` it asserts because the month value is out of range (0..11). In release mode it crashes.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAt the very least, it should not crash. Ideally, it should handle dates older than 1970 (I assume any date with a negative duration.) Libc++ and libstdc++ both seem to handle these dates fine.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug.\r\n```\r\n#include <chrono>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n\r\n#include \"catch_amalgamated.hpp\"\r\n\r\nusing namespace std::chrono;\r\nusing namespace std::literals::chrono_literals;\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE(\"TestOldDates\")\r\n{\r\n  static constexpr system_clock::time_point c_Dec30_1899 = sys_days(December / 30 / 1899);\r\n\r\n  Catch::StringMaker<system_clock::time_point> sm;\r\n  // Next line will assert/crash\r\n  auto s = sm.convert(c_Dec30_1899);\r\n  std::cout << s << \"\\n\";\r\n\r\n  // Next line will crash when it tries to output the values.\r\n  CHECK(c_Dec30_1899 != c_Dec30_1899);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n<!-- Fill in any extra information that might be important for your issue. -->\r\n - OS: **Windows NT**\r\n - Compiler+version: **Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2022, Version 17.11.6**\r\n - Catch version: **v3.7.1**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nMicrosoft's implementation of `gmtime_s`, along with `std::gmtime` all return an error if the input time is negative. Maybe this is really a Microsoft bug?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2944/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
