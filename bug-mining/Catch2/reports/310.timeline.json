Description\r\n\r\nIn a failing test, the sectionend() corresponding to a sectionstart() could possibly pop different data than was pushed. This is because sectionEndedEarly() would push the failing section onto another stack (m_unfinishedSections), and then the next sectionEnded() would close the hanging sectionStarted(). Then the m_unfinishedSections would be popped, filling up the remaining hanging sections.\r\n\r\nThis caused two issues:\r\n\t\r\nOne: any reporter relying on SectionEnd() having accurate section data was broken. SectionEnd() would present different data than SectionStarted(). This caused an issue for the junit reporter, which relies on that data matching to manage the parralel m_sectionStack \r\n\r\nHowever, this also applied to other reporters; having the xml reporter write the \"name\" attribute to the OverallResults written in sectionEnded revealed that it was not matching the section.\r\n\r\nTwo: I noticed where tests containing failing sections would pass through again, but not hit any nodes. Since a failing section would not be popped, it would remain on the stack, and this causes the test runner to believe that the test requires another pass because there are unresolved open sections (when all sections were actually closed).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both of these problems and does not seem to have any down side. Is there some edge case where it is important to pop the stack out of order? To me this looks like legacy code that is no longer useful.\r\n\r\nThe change I made was just to always call sectionEnded() and never sectionEndedEarly().\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this needs a larger workaround to avoid introducing similar bugs. sectionEnded() shouldn't consume anything and should automatically pop the top.\r\n\r\nSorry about the verbose description.\r\n\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issues\r\n\r\nCloses #1650\r\nCloses #417\r\nIt also looks related to #1210 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1651/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1651/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/543276847","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1210#issuecomment-543276847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1210","id":543276847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzI3Njg0Nw==","user":{"login":"briterator","id":13194087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTk0MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13194087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator","html_url":"https://github.com/briterator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briterator/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-17T17:21:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-17T21:28:35Z","body":"I'm seeing this pretty regularly, but not 100% consistently, on our windows builds.

the bug**\r\nWhen I run the following test, the last check `CHECK( i == 3 )` fails when I use the JUnit reporter (passing the `-r junit` argument to the binary), but passes when I use the xml or console reporter.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    // Stupid test to understand the behaviour of the std::filesystem library\r\n    auto it2 = std::filesystem::directory_iterator(\"C:/tests/sample_dir\", ec);\r\n    int i = 0;\r\n    for ( ; it2 != std::filesystem::directory_iterator() ; it2.increment(ec)) {\r\n      REQUIRE( !ec );\r\n      CHECK( it2 != std::filesystem::directory_iterator() );\r\n      ++i;\r\n    }\r\n    CHECK( i == 3 ); // <-- This fails using the JUnit reporter but not with the xml and console reporter\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe test should pass for all reporters\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\n1.  Create a project to generate a binary and add the code below. \r\n2. Create on your computer a folder and add 3 items (files or folders).  If you are under macOS, you may have to create only two items because the Finder application will create a `.DS_Store` file (or you can adapt the test in consequence)\r\n3. Run the binary using the argument `-r console` (pass)\r\n4. Run the binary using the argument `-r xml` (pass)\r\n5. Run the binary using the argument `-r junit` (fail)\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// Copy/paste from a larger CPP file.

However, if a signal is being handled, we have not and will not call the destructors for the Sections, which means, all those Sections are in `m_activeSections` and not `m_unfinishedSections`.\r\n\r\nMy (potentially very dirty) fix is the following before the call to `handleUnfinishedSections()`:\r\n```c++\r\nwhile (!m_activeSections.empty()) {\r\n    auto nl = m_activeSections.back()->nameAndLocation();\r\n    SectionEndInfo endInfo{ SectionInfo(nl.location, nl.name), {}, 0.0 };\r\n    sectionEndedEarly(CATCH_MOVE(endInfo));\r\n}\r\nhandleUnfinishedSections();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI move the Sections from `m_activeSections` to `m_unfinishedSections` in a best effort way as to not trigger the assertion later.\r\n\r\nBtw, here is a test case that reproduces the issue for me (with `--reporter JUnit`):\r\n```c++\r\nTEST_CASE(\"broken\") {\r\n   SECTION(\"section\") {\r\n      /// Use illegal cpu instruction\r\n      __asm__ __volatile__(\"ud2\" : : : \"memory\");\r\n
