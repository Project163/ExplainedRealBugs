I keep getting into trouble by saying what I'm planning on for the future (as half the time it doesn't happen) but...\n\nI'm hoping to work on a feature in Clara (the command line parser that I spun out of Catch) that will unify the ability to specify configuration through the command line, environment variables and compile time macros. So I'm really holding off for that.\n\nHowever there is an extra nuance with what you're proposing as it requires being able to #include windows headers as well as *nix headers.\nIt's not that that's impossible - just that it's not a simple selection between them (as it's only going to possible on a narrow range of platforms - so needs to be enabled at compile time - but then made selectable at runtime). So I'd need to tread carefully.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/66814235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/66814875","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/339#issuecomment-66814875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/339","id":66814875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODE0ODc1","user":{"login":"vadz","id":146917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjkxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz","html_url":"https://github.com/vadz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-12T18:39:13Z","updated_at":"2014-12-12T18:39:13Z","body":"OT but, concerning Clara, where is it developed?
