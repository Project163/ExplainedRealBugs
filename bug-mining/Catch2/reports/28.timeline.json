has 214 open \"Issues\" on github.\n\nNothing wrong with that per se, but going through the list I note that many of them could be either closed or marked as feature request. \n\nI'd like to share my Impression with Phil so he can maybe save some time dealing with the Issues.\n\nThe following Issues have been resolved (fixed or declined) and can be closed, but the ticket is still open:\n#665, #620, #600, #584, #574, #573, #572, #560, #525. Maybe also #593, #590, #565, not sure.\n\nThe following remind me of support requests. They could be closed with a hint to ask the forum if the question is still relevant: #671, #666, #632, #621, #612, #607, #603, #576, #569, #567, #552, #547, #542, #539, #536, #531, #529, #522, #516, #515.\n\nThen there are a lot of feature requests. This shows that people like using Catch, and would like it even better if it supported just one more feature. It is of course completely up to Phil how to deal with these. If I were in his place, I would close the ones that are not on my roadmap, saying so, and label the remaining ones as feature requests, if this is supported by the github bug tracker, so they do not count as open bugs. These are: (Performance:) #668, #556, (Output:) #664, #663, #639, #638, #613, (TestingTools:) #652, #651, #642, #641, (Test Runner:) #645, #629, #622, (Cosmetic:) #610, #609, #601, (Esoteric:) #644, #640, #611, #605, #589, (Other:) #582, #558, #553.\n\nThis here is caused by bugs in third-party software and can be closed in the catch Bug Tracker: #661.\n\nThese bugs show up when using outdated or exotic compilers or targets. They could be closed, stating that Catch does not target these compilers / platforms: #674, #649, #594, #583, #579, #575, #543.\n\nI would classify the following bugs to have a low priority, as they are unlikely to affect the main function of catch (perform tests reliably:) #625 (output), #617 (cosmetic), #615 (const correctness), #586 (debugger support), #578 (language lawyer case).\n\nSome of the following have been mentioned above, some not. I find their info relevant enough to test the respective situation myself with the compiler and platform that I intend to use before committing to use Catch myself: #649, #602, #594, #593, #590, #583, #579, #575, #543,\n#574 causes me to add a coding standard rule that testing objects with custom (&&,||,!) operators (which I cannot envision why I would have that) inside Catch macros is not permitted.\n\nOh, I only got as far back as #515. Not sure if I will continue, or chose another unit testing library.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/675/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/279404360","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/674#issuecomment-279404360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/674","id":279404360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTQwNDM2MA==","user":{"login":"vadz","id":146917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjkxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz","html_url":"https://github.com/vadz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-13T14:19:03Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T14:19:03Z","body":"FWIW this is still a problem with v1.7.1.

news is that there are some bugs in gcc's handling of `_Pragma` pre gcc-4.8, so it is useless anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point we will probably end up just force disabling these for pre 4.8 gcc, and use the `_Pragma` option for post 4.8 gcc.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/280049476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":963310715,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTYzMzEwNzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/963310715","actor":{"login":"vadz","id":146917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjkxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz","html_url":"https://github.com/vadz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-15T15:53:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":963310718,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk2MzMxMDcxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/963310718","actor":{"login":"vadz","id":146917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjkxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz","html_url":"https://github.com/vadz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-15T15:53:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/280049708","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/674#issuecomment-280049708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/674","id":280049708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDA0OTcwOA==","user":{"login":"vadz","id":146917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjkxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz","html_url":"https://github.com/vadz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T15:54:03Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T15:54:03Z","body":"`_Pragma`

has been discussed/mentioned in many different places, but the issues/PRs have all been closed while the problem still exists, so I'd like to open a new one if only to monitor it.\n\nThe problem is that using `CATCH( x == y )` results in a\n\n```\nwarning: suggest parentheses around comparison in operand of '==' [-Wparentheses]\n```\n\nwhen compiling with `-Wall` since the changes of #247. This is very annoying (each full warning takes 6 lines, but even would have been too much considering the number of them I'm getting).\n\nThe worst part is that there doesn't seem to be any way to get rid of it without disabling the warning globally in `catch.hpp`, i.e. disabling it temporarily and restoring it doesn't work. And, contrary to what I wrote myself in #528, this is not limited to older g++ versions but also happens with g++ 5.3, for example.\n\nSomething really needs to be done about this and the simplest solution is to indeed disable the warning. But while I'm ambivalent about this warning myself (it didn't find a single real problem in my code but created many thousands false positives, since it was introduced), I think it's bad manners for a library to disable warnings that the user didn't disable explicitly, so it would be nice to find another solution. Unfortunately the only one I see is reverting #247. Maybe I'm missing something, but I just don't see many benefits in this change, writing `CATCH( 1+1 == 2 )` is not something I often (or ever, in fact) do, and it could have been done using `CATCH( (1+1) == 2 )` even before, without any real loss of functionality.\n\n**TL;DR**: Currently the first thing I do when upgrading CATCH in any of the projects using it is to disable `-Wparentheses` and it's tiresome to keep doing it. This warning should be either disabled in CATCH itself or #247 should be reverted.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/593/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/282078063","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/674#issuecomment-282078063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/674","id":282078063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjA3ODA2Mw==","user":{"login":"obfuscated","id":2459214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTkyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2459214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated","html_url":"https://github.com/obfuscated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obfuscated/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T18:28:46Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T18:28:46Z","body":"Seems fixed when using GCC 4.4.
