So, it seems to me, this could be fixed by replacing the \r\n```cmake\r\nset(properties ${TEST_PROPERTIES})\r\n```\r\nline in `CatchAddTests.cmake` with\r\n```cmake\r\nset(properties \"${TEST_PROPERTIES};SKIP_RETURN_CODE;4\")\r\n```\r\nThis works for me as does passing `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 4` to `catch_discover_tests` `PROPETIES` argument, e.g. like so:\r\n```cmake\r\ncatch_discover_tests(middleware_tests\r\n  PROPERTIES\r\n    SKIP_RETURN_CODE 4\r\n)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2873/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2873/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
