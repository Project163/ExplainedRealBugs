I have test cases for `exclude:<test name>` and `~[<tag>]` but guess what I'm missing a test for for?\n\nI've just added some and can see the problem. Will fix that.\nIn the meantime using `~` instead of `exclude:` does work - so you may want to use that (I prefer that syntax anyway and use it all the time, which is why I missed `exclude:` rotting!).\n\nYou're right about the documentation, too. I'll give that another pass over.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/41528982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":115585788,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE1NTg1Nzg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/115585788","actor":{"login":"VictorEijkhout","id":684162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDE2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/684162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorEijkhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-04-28T07:08:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":115585789,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExNTU4NTc4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/115585789","actor":{"login":"VictorEijkhout","id":684162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDE2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/684162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorEijkhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorEijkhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-04-28T07:08:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":121994448,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTIxOTk0NDQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/121994448","actor":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"65cc14c44e2673e028ff2e6fa3a91c426c2a914a","co
