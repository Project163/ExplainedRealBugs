However, it turns out that is not enough, as an rvalue of `std::string` prefers `T&&` overload to `std::string const&` overload, and the same goes for most variants, see this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <string>\r\n\r\nvoid overloaded(std::string const& str) {\r\n    std::cout << \"str const&\\n\";\r\n}\r\n\r\ntemplate <typename T>\r\nvoid overloaded(T&& t) {\r\n    std::cout << \"T&&\\n\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nusing namespace std::string_literals;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    std::string lval;\r\n    std::string const& clref = \"ddd\"s;\r\n    std::string& lref = lval;\r\n    \r\n    overloaded(lval);  // T&&\r\n    overloaded(clref); // str const&\r\n    overloaded(lref);  // T&&\r\n    overloaded(std::string{}); // T&&\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also no reasonable way to SFINAE away the \"wrong\" overload, as both overloads make sense when dealing with `std::string`. The range overload makes sense when the lhs is something like `std::vector<std::string>`, while the string overload makes sense when the lhs is `std::string`, and there is no way to detect which of these is the case when the overload is being selected. (And even if there was a way to fix that, it would probably be too much magic).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end result is that the `Contains(std::string const&, CaseSensitive)` overload needs to be renamed to avoid clashing with the generic range overload.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/804372636/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4492699314,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ0OTI2OTkzMTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/4492699314","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-22T21:49:55Z","label":{"name":"Serious bug","color":"b60205"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/806517333","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2131#issuecomment-806517333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2131","id":806517333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNjUxNzMzMw==","user":{"login":"pr0g","id":1136625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzY2MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1136625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g","html_url":"https://github.com/pr0g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr0g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-25T09:59:31Z","updated_at":"2021-03-25T09:59:31Z","body":"Thanks very much for the follow-up @horenmar!\r\n\r\nI'm glad I wasn't being completely blind and missed something obvious.\r\n\r\nIs the fix then ultimately just a rename?
