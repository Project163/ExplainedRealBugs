In this is the case, please redirect the output to a file or directly to `less`. For example on my console I can see:\r\n```\r\n$ tests/tests Dummy -r xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<Catch name=\"tests\">\r\n  <Group name=\"tests\">\r\n    <TestCase name=\"Dummy\" filename=\"/home/LAN/bronek/Sources/market/tests/main.cpp\" line=\"9\">\r\n      <Expression success=\"false\" type=\"CHECK\" filename=\"/home/LAN/bronek/Sources/market/tests/main.cpp\" line=\"10\">\r\n        <Original>\r\n          foo() == npos\r\n        </Original>\r\n        <Expanded>\r\n          '' == ''\r\n        </Expanded>\r\n      </Expression>\r\n      <OverallResult success=\"false\"/>\r\n    </TestCase>\r\n    <OverallResults successes=\"0\" failures=\"1\" expectedFailures=\"0\"/>\r\n  </Group>\r\n  <OverallResults successes=\"0\" failures=\"1\" expectedFailures=\"0\"/>\r\n</Catch>\r\n```\r\nThe xml **appears** to be well-formed above, but the reason for failing test is shrouded in mystery. The error becomes visible only if I do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tests/tests Dummy -r xml | less\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error is also visible for succeeding test cases (if `-s` option is used, of course).\r\n\r\n* Catch version: **v2.1.2**\r\n* Operating System: **Linux**\r\n* Compiler+version: **GCC 7.3** and **Clang 5.0.1**\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
