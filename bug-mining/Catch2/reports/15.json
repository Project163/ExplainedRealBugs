For noexcept this works, but there are several inconsistencies, as an example `CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_UNIQUE_PTR` is disabled with `CATCH_CONFIG_NO_UNIQUE_PTR`. According to documentation it should be `CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_NO_UNIQUE_PTR`.\r\n\r\nI actually introduced one of those, in 6991549457a13aa73f4ca59862b794ee7ed5e177 because I looked at toggle for unique_ptr and didn't notice the inconsistency.","closed_by":{"login":"philsquared","id":92878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared","html_url":"https://github.com/philsquared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsquared/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
