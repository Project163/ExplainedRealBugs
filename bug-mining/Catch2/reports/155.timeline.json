the bug**\r\nIn a few places in the catch header, unicode characters are used but the header does not contain a BOM UTF-8 marker. Most compilers will assume that source files are using UTF-8 but this is not always the case, especially on Windows. If your locale is set to Japanese, the unicode characters will be interpreteted as SHIFT-JS characters and cause compilation to fail with a warning similar to this:\r\n\r\n`...\\catch2\\single_include\\catch2\\catch.hpp(3243): warning C4819: The file contains a character that cannot be represented in the current code page (932). Save the file in Unicode format to prevent data loss (compiling source file ...)`\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples that explain the issue:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47690822/possible-to-force-cmake-msvc-to-use-utf-8-encoding-for-source-files-without-a-bo\r\nhttps://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/6404\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/10501634/warning-c4819-how-to-find-the-character-that-has-to-be-saved-in-unicode\r\nhttps://github.com/nfrechette/acl/issues/260\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the issue, a fix similar to [this](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/commit/4e08dbb2533fb55db22b84077def38a26b90854b) is required which is unfortunate.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCatch2 should work regardless of the host compiler locale without requiring special compilation switches to force source code encoding.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction steps**\r\nSet the windows locale to Japanese and compile a project that uses Catch2.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Platform information:**\r\n - OS: **Windows 10**\r\n - Compiler+version: **MSVC**\r\n - Catch version: **v2.5.0**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm not sure whether it is possible to include the BOM in the generated header. The easiest solution would be to remove all usage of unicode characters. There are a few that add no value as part of comments (such as the famous shrug ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ) and [one minor instance](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/6ccd467094973824d89efb16cbc553e279f79823/single_include/catch2/catch.hpp#L13006) (the 'micro' character) that could probably be omitted.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1869/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11998469006,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM4YeXNVzwAAAALLKhuO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/11998469006","actor":{"login":"uilianries","id":4870173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzAxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4870173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries","html_url":"https://github.com/uilianries","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uilianries/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"093b72416de31a804fea15a4055bb44cb523401f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uilianries/Catch2/commits/093b72416de31a804fea15a4055bb44cb523401f","created_at":"2024-03-04T12:39:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
