The prototype is at line 844.\n\nBut I just checked (again) in my OC test project and it all seems to work fine. I even tried your example, to see if there was anything specific about it. A couple of things I noted there:\n1. You wrote `CATCH` for the assertion. I presume you meant `CHECK`?\n2. Because of the interplay between ARC and templates I can't compare the NSString directly against nil - I have to cast the nil to an NSString\\* - so my test was actually like this:\n\n```\nNSString *string = @\"not null\";\nCHECK((NSString*)nil != string);\n```\n\nBut that all builds fine.\n\nI'll take another look tomorrow. If you're able to boil it down to the minimal complete example that fails that might help too.
