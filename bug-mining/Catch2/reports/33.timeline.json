your policy about handling crashes in Catch, wouldn't it be better if Catch avoided to trigger a second crash so that it could at least close all xml elements and exit the application? I remember that in some previous version of catch, the reportFatal function used to call exit(). It seems that it now just returns and the code just crashes again in a loop. Since C++ is very prone to crashes, I think there is a real need for correct crash handling (at least we have a need for it).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/277945076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"blastrock","id":1370530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzA1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1370530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock","html_url":"https://github.com/blastrock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blastrock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/277951281","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/810#issuecomment-277951281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/810","id":277951281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Nzk1MTI4MQ==","user":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-07T09:54:10Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T09:54:10Z","body":"The
