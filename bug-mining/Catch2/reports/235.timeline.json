Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nIn the next version of glibc, 2.34, `SIGSTKSZ` will be changed from a preprocessor constant to an expression involving a runtime function call. This has broken a lot of software that used it as a stack or static buffer size.\r\n\r\nIn leatherman, a copy of the Catch unit test framework (version 1.x rather than the current 2.x) is bundled in the “vendor” area. It is part of the public API, and cpp-hocon uses it for its unit tests. Since the `SIGSTKSZ` change, the `cpp-hocon` build fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn file included from /usr/include/signal.h:315,\r\n                 from /usr/include/leatherman/vendor/catch.hpp:6448,\r\n                 from /builddir/build/BUILD/cpp-hocon-0.3.0/lib/tests/main.cc:2:\r\n/usr/include/leatherman/vendor/catch.hpp:6471:33: error: size of array 'altStackMem' is not an integral constant-expression\r\n 6471 |         static char altStackMem[SIGSTKSZ];\r\n      |                                 ^~~~~~~~\r\n/usr/include/leatherman/vendor/catch.hpp:6522:45: error: size of array 'altStackMem' is not an integral constant-expression\r\n 6522 |     char FatalConditionHandler::altStackMem[SIGSTKSZ] = {};\r\n      |                                             ^~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nThe unit tests build and work\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Find a platform with a pre-release version of glibc 2.34 or later, such as Fedora Rawhide\r\n2. Build cpp-hocon\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n - Version 0.3.0\r\n - Platform Fedora Rawhide/35 and 34\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\nFrom the glibc 2.34 release notes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Add _SC_MINSIGSTKSZ and _SC_SIGSTKSZ.  When _SC_SIGSTKSZ_SOURCE or\r\n  _GNU_SOURCE are defined, MINSIGSTKSZ and SIGSTKSZ are no longer\r\n  constant on Linux.  MINSIGSTKSZ is redefined to sysconf(_SC_MINSIGSTKSZ)\r\n  and SIGSTKSZ is redefined to sysconf (_SC_SIGSTKSZ).\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the upstream Catch issue for both 1.x and 2.x: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2178\r\n\r\nI am the maintainer of the cpp-hocon package in Fedora Linux. I have worked around this by patching the CMakeLists files to use the system copy of catch (`catch1-devel` in Fedora), which contains a workaround.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there were a CMake Boolean I could set to use an external or system copy of Catch without patching the build system. I would prefer to do that even after leatherman fixes its copy of Catch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/cpp-hocon/issues/132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/cpp-hocon/issues/132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4470053000,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ0NzAwNTMwMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/4470053000","actor":{"login":"sixg0000d","id":17105863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTA1ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17105863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d","html_url":"https://github.com/sixg0000d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixg0000d/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cb9dd8fd49e917d842ac7f51379e2b16479c4c5f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sixg0000d-copr/shadowsocksr-uvw/commits/cb9dd8fd49e917d842ac7f51379e2b16479c4c5f","created_at":"2021-03-17T12:54:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-24T18:21:36Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T18:21:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2192","id":837007454,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MzcwMDc0NTQ=","number":2192,"title":"2.13.4:
