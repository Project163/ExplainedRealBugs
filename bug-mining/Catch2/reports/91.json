The documentation states:\r\n> **margin** serves to set the the absolute value by which a result can be erroneous before it is rejected. By default set to `0.0`.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of this is that if the result is erroneous by precisely the margin, then it should not be rejected.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n```c++\r\n#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN\r\n#include \"catch.hpp\"\r\n\r\nTEST_CASE( \"Approx with exactly-representable margin\" )\r\n{\r\n    CHECK( 0.25f == Approx( 0.0f ).margin( 0.25f ) );\r\n\r\n    CHECK( 0.0f == Approx( 0.25f ).margin( 0.25f ) );\r\n    CHECK( 0.5f == Approx( 0.25f ).margin( 0.25f ) );\r\n\r\n    CHECK( 245.0f == Approx( 245.25f ).margin( 0.25f ) );\r\n    CHECK( 245.5f == Approx( 245.25f ).margin( 0.25f ) );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Current result:* All five assertions fail.\r\n*Expected result:* All five assertions pass.\r\n\r\n### Extra information\r\n<!--\r\nFill in any extra information that might be important for your issue.\r\n\r\nIf your issue is a bugreport, definitely fill out at least the following.\r\n-->\r\n* Catch version: **v1.9.6**\r\n* Operating System: **CentOS 7 Linux on AMD64**\r\n* Compiler+version: **g++ \"Red Hat 4.8.5-4\"** (stock) and **g++ Red Hat 6.2.1-3** (devtoolset-6)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/952/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
