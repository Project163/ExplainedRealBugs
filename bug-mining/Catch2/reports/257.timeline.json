PR tries to fix #2304 \"Test case name hashing should consider tags and class name too\".\r\nThe goal is to \"allow test cases with same name, but different tags, or same names and tags but different class name\".\r\n\r\nSee the following code example that describes what is wanted:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nCatch::StringRef className1{std::string(\"C1\")};\r\nCatch::NameAndTags nameAndTag1{std::string(\"N1\"), std::string(\"[T1]\")};\r\n\r\nCatch::StringRef className2{std::string(\"C2\")};\r\nCatch::NameAndTags nameAndTag2{std::string(\"N2\"), std::string(\"[T2]\")};\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis set of test cases satisfies the wanted unique test case invariant as soon as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (N1 == N2 || C1 == C2) then [T1] != [T2]\r\nAND\r\nif (C1 == C2 || [T1] == [T2]) then N1 != N2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the code behaves as follows:\r\nWhen `TestRunOrder::Randomized` is set, `getAllTestsSorted()` does the following:\r\n1) Use `TestHasher` hash the class name of a `TestCaseInfo` (using the FNV-1a algorithm) and push them to a vector.\r\n2) Sort the vector by the hashes, on equality, compare name, if equal compare class name, if also equal compare tags.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the code behaves as follows:\r\nWhen `TestRunOrder::Randomized` is set, `getAllTestsSorted()` does the following:\r\n1) Use `TestCaseInfoHasher` to generate hashes that considers class name, name and tag and push them to a vector.\r\n2) Sorting the vector by the hashes. When the unique test case invariant described above is satisfied, the hashes will be unique.\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to Catch2, hope i went in the right direction and would be happy about feedback, comments, etc.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6344677362,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA2rM49Ojb2zwAAAAF6LBfy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/6344677362","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-31T14:46:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6344677678,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA2rM49Ojb2zwAAAAF6LBku","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/events/6344677678","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"78e33ce51f78f0837b36a0e8b6b92c4b2a860178","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/commits/78e33ce51f78f0837b36a0e8b6b92c4b2a860178","created_at":"2022-03-31T14:46:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
