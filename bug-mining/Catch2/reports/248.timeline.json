Console reporter is trying to be fancy and make it so that when there is \": \" in the test name, then to change how the text is line broken like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCheck this out: \r\n                fancy linebreaking!\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of just this\r\n```\r\nCheck this out:\r\nfancy linebreaking?\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the test name you have is long enough that it suddenly asks for line breaks to happen _past_ the allowed line width and then all hell breaks loose. This can be fixed easily enough by clamping the computed indentation value, but that can still lead to some pathological behaviour, e.g. like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCheck this out:\r\n                f\r\n                a\r\n                n\r\n                c\r\n                y\r\n                \r\n                l\r\n                i\r\n                .\r\n                .\r\n                .\r\n```\r\n\r\nif the break falls just on the edge of the output width.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/949968363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/950673377","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2309#issuecomment-950673377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2309","id":950673377,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA2rM44qh_h","user":{"login":"KKoovalsky","id":17928698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTI4Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17928698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky","html_url":"https://github.com/KKoovalsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKoovalsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T08:42:24Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T08:42:24Z","body":"Can we remove the feature related to fancy line breaking?
