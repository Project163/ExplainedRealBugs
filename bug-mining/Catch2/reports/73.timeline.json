Hopefully they would do better with Catch 2, where implementations are split out into .cpp files, but going through them like this is kinda painful.\r\n\r\nResharper loves to say \"use this c++11 feature in your C++98 codebase\". Ironically, when Catch is properly configured to support C++11, some of these (`override`s, `noexcept`s) are already used.\r\n\r\n## Actionable finds:\r\n### CppCheck\r\n```\r\n..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Local\\Project\\_GitHub\\Catch\\single_include\\catch.hpp|500|copyCtorAndEqOperator : style : The class 'NotImplementedException' has 'copy constructor' but lack of 'operator='.|\r\n..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Local\\Project\\_GitHub\\Catch\\single_include\\catch.hpp|2528|copyCtorAndEqOperator : style : The class 'CompositeGenerator' has 'copy constructor' but lack of 'operator='.|\r\n..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Local\\Project\\_GitHub\\Catch\\single_include\\catch.hpp|2770|copyCtorAndEqOperator : style : The class 'Approx' has 'copy constructor' but lack of 'operator='.|\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeleted the constructors for `Approx` and `NotImplementedException`. Neither of those would cause a problem, because the default generated `operator=` would do the right thing, but there is no reason to keep them explicitly. `CompositeGenerator` has move semantics in copy constructor going on and no `operator=`, which is weird, but generators are a very vestigial part of Catch 1 (never documented or officially supported) and their current implementation is gone in Catch 2, so I am not touching that.\r\n\r\nI didn't go through all the \"never used\" warnings, because I know that some of them are used, so it is likely more false positives.\r\n\r\n### PVS Studio\r\n```\r\nV817 It is more efficient to seek '.' character rather than a string. SelfTest catch_session.hpp 98\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo reason not to fix this. The others are things that we might want to suppress in the future, but basically false positives. (The `throw` warning is caused by indirection that it doesn't quite see through, the pointer cast is necessary evil for `REQUIRE( ptr == NULL )` to work).\r\n\r\n### Resharper-C++\r\nGoes completely crazy in face of obj-c. Used it to get rid of superfluous `inline`s in Catch 1 (did so in Catch 2 some time ago) and otherwise skipped it, as already mentioned it loves to say \"use auto in C++98 codebase\", so there is too much reported.\r\n\r\n### Core Guidelines\r\nSkipped for now.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAll in all, relatively useful but would probably work better against Catch 2, so some of the tools wouldn't be horribly confused by Catch being implemented in headers only, and so all the \"use override, auto, constexpr\" would be actionable (and also wouldn't be used in places where they already are used hidden in macro).\r\n\r\nFixed couple problems, going to fix couple more*\r\n\r\n* Catch is currently Valgrind and sanitizer clean, so the uninitialized variable warnings are not real bugs, but I would prefer them not to be there. However I am going to need some time to decide how to best tackle them.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/316321796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horenmar","id":9026413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjY0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9026413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar","html_url":"https://github.com/horenmar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horenmar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/comments/316344668","html_url":"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/957#issuecomment-316344668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catchorg/Catch2/issues/957","id":316344668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjM0NDY2OA==","user":{"login":"martinmoene","id":1999290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTkyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1999290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene","html_url":"https://github.com/martinmoene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinmoene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T10:37:20Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T10:37:20Z","body":"@horenmar
