 # Reporters
 
-Catch has a modular reporting system and comes bundled with a handful of useful reporters built in.
-You can also write your own reporters.
+Reporters are a customization point for most of Catch2's output, e.g.
+formatting and writing out [assertions (whether passing or failing),
+sections, test cases, benchmarks, and so on](reporter-events.md#top).
+
+Catch2 comes with a bunch of reporters by default (currently 8), and
+you can also write your own reporter. Because multiple reporters can
+be active at the same time, your own reporters do not even have to handle
+all reporter event, just the ones you are interested in, e.g. benchmarks.
+
 
 ## Using different reporters
 
-The reporter to use can easily be controlled from the command line.
-To specify a reporter use [`-r` or `--reporter`](command-line.md#choosing-a-reporter-to-use), followed by the name of the reporter, e.g.:
+You can see which reporters are available by running the test binary
+with `--list-reporters`. You can then pick one of them with the [`-r`,
+`--reporter` option](command-line.md#choosing-a-reporter-to-use), followed
+by the name of the desired reporter, like so:
 
 ```
--r xml
+--reporter xml
 ```
 
-If you don't specify a reporter then the console reporter is used by default.
-There are four reporters built in to the single include:
-
-* `console` writes as lines of text, formatted to a typical terminal width, with colours if a capable terminal is detected.
-* `compact` similar to `console` but optimised for minimal output - each entry on one line
-* `junit` writes xml that corresponds to Ant's [junitreport](http://help.catchsoftware.com/display/ET/JUnit+Format) target. Useful for build systems that understand Junit.
-Because of the way the junit format is structured the run must complete before anything is written.
-* `xml` writes an xml format tailored to Catch. Unlike `junit` this is a streaming format so results are delivered progressively.
-
-There are a few additional reporters, for specific build systems, in the Catch repository (in `include\reporters`) which you can `#include` in your project if you would like to make use of them.
-Do this in one source file - the same one you have `CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN` or `CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER`.
-
-* `teamcity` writes the native, streaming, format that [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) understands.
-Use this when building as part of a TeamCity build to see results as they happen ([code example](../examples/207-Rpt-TeamCityReporter.cpp)).
-* `tap` writes in the TAP ([Test Anything Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol)) format.
-* `automake` writes in a format that correspond to [automake  .trs](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Log-files-generation-and-test-results-recording.html) files
-* `sonarqube` writes the [SonarQube Generic Test Data](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/generic-test/) XML format.
-
-You see what reporters are available from the command line by running with `--list-reporters`.
+You can also select multiple reporters to be used at the same time.
+In that case you should read the [section on using multiple
+reporters](#multiple-reporters) to avoid any surprises from doing so.
 
-By default all these reports are written to stdout, but can be redirected to a file with [`-o` or `--out`](command-line.md#sending-output-to-a-file)

 ## Using multiple reporters
 
 > Support for having multiple parallel reporters was [introduced](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/pull/2183) in Catch2 X.Y.Z
 
-Multiple reporters may be used at the same time, e.g. to save a machine-readable output to a file but still print the human-readable output to the console:
+Catch2 supports using multiple reporters at the same time while having
+them write into different destinations. The two main uses of this are
+
+* having both human-friendly and machine-parseable (e.g. in JUnit format)
+  output from one run of binary
+* having "partial" reporters that are highly specialized, e.g. having one
+  reporter that writes out benchmark results as markdown tables and does
+  nothing else, while also having standard testing output separately
+
+Specifying multiple reporter looks like this:
 ```
--r console -r xml::result.xml -r junit::result-junit.xml
+--reporter console::- --reporter JUnit::result-junit.xml
 ```
 
-The output file name is given after the reporter name, delimited by a colon. If omitted, it defaults to the file name specified by `-o` (or stdout). Only one reporter may use the default output.
+Using multiple reporters (or one reporter and one-or-more [event
+listeners](event-listener.md#top)) can have surprisingly complex semantics
+when using customization points provided to reporters by Catch2, namely
+capturing stdout/stderr from test cases.
+
+As long as at least one reporter (or listener) asks Catch2 to capture
+stdout/stderr, captured stdout and stderr will be available to all
+reporters and listeners.
+
+Because this might be surprising to the users, if at least one active
+_reporter_ is non-capturing, then Catch2 tries to roughly emulate
+non-capturing behaviour by printing out the captured stdout/stderr
+just before `testCasePartialEnded` event is sent out to the active
+reporters and listeners. This means that stdout/stderr is no longer
+printed out from tests as it is being written, but instead it is written
+out in batch after each runthrough of a test case is finished.
+
 
 
 ## Writing your own reporter
 
-You can write your own custom reporter and register it with Catch.
-At time of writing the interface is subject to some changes so is not, yet, documented here.
-If you are determined you shouldn't have too much trouble working it out from the existing implementations -
-but do keep in mind upcoming changes (these will be minor, simplifying, changes such as not needing to forward calls to the base class).
+You can also write your own custom reporter and tell Catch2 to use it.
+When writing your reporter, you have two options:
+
+* Derive from `Catch::IStreamingReporter`. When doing this, you will have
+  to provide handling for all [reporter events](reporter-events.md#top).
+* Derive from one of the provided [utility reporter bases in
+  Catch2](#utility-reporter-bases).
+
+Generally we recommend doing the latter, as it is less work.
+
+Apart from overriding handling of the individual reporter events, reporters
+have access to some extra customization points, described below.
+
+
+### Utility reporter bases
+
+Catch2 currently provides two utility reporter bases:
+
+* `Catch::StreamingReporterBase`
+* `Catch::CumulativeReporterBase`
+
+`StreamingReporterBase` is useful for reporters that can format and write
+out the events as they come in. It provides (usually empty) implementation
+for all reporter events, and if you let it handle the relevant events,
+it also handles storing information about active test run and test case.
+
+`CumulativeReporterBase` is a base for reporters that need to see the whole
+test run, before they can start writing the output, such as the JUnit
+and SonarQube reporters. This post-facto approach requires the assertions
+to be stringified when it is finished, so that the assertion can be written
+out later. Because the stringification can be expensive, and not all
+cumulative reporters need the assertions, this base provides customization
+point to change whether the assertions are saved or not, separate for
+passing and failing assertions.
+
+
+_Generally we recommend that if you override a member function from either
+of the bases, you call into the base's implementation first. This is not
+necessarily in all cases, but it is safer and easier._
+
+
+Writing your own reporter then looks like this:
+
+```cpp
+#include <catch2/reporters/catch_reporter_streaming_base.hpp>
+#include <catch2/catch_test_case_info.hpp>
+#include <catch2/reporters/catch_reporter_registrars.hpp>
+
+#include <iostream>
+
+class PartialReporter : public Catch::StreamingReporterBase {
+public:
+    using StreamingReporterBase::StreamingReporterBase;
+
+    static std::string getDescription() {
+        return "Reporter for testing TestCasePartialStarting/Ended events";
+    }
+
+    void testCasePartialStarting(Catch::TestCaseInfo const& testInfo,
+                                 uint64_t partNumber) override {
+        std::cout << "TestCaseStartingPartial: " << testInfo.name << '#' << partNumber << '\n';
+    }
+
+    void testCasePartialEnded(Catch::TestCaseStats const& testCaseStats,
+                              uint64_t partNumber) override {
+        std::cout << "TestCasePartialEnded: " << testCaseStats.testInfo->name << '#' << partNumber << '\n';
+    }
+};
+
+
+CATCH_REGISTER_REPORTER("partial", PartialReporter)
+```
+
+This create a simple reporter that responds to `testCasePartial*` events,
+and calls itself "partial" reporter, so it can be invoked with
+`--reporter partial` command line flag.
+
+
+### `ReporterPreferences`
+
+Each reporter instance contains instance of `ReporterPreferences`, a type
+that holds flags for the behaviour of Catch2 when this reporter run.
+Currently there are two customization options:
+
+* `shouldRedirectStdOut` - whether the reporter wants to handle
+   writes to stdout/stderr from user code, or not. This is useful for
+   reporters that output machine-parseable output, e.g. the JUnit
+   reporter, or the XML reporter.
+* `shouldReportAllAssertions` - whether the reporter wants to handle
+  `assertionEnded` events for passing assertions as well as failing
+   assertions. Usually reporters do not report successful assertions
+   and don't need them for their output, but sometimes the desired output
+   format includes passing assertions even without the `-s` flag.
+
+
+### Other expected functionality of a reporter
+
+When writing a custom reporter, there are few more things that you should
+keep in mind. These are not important for correctness, but they are
+important for the reporter to work _nicely_.
+
+* Catch2 provides a simple verbosity option for users. There are three
+  verbosity levels, "quiet", "normal", and "high", and if it makes sense
+  for reporter's output format, it should respond to these by changing
+  what, and how much, it writes out.
+
+* Catch2 operates with an rng-seed. Knowing what seed a test run had
+  is important if you want to replicate it, so your reporter should
+  report the rng-seed, if at all possible given the target output format.
+
+* Catch2 also operates with test filters, or test specs. If a filter
+  is present, you should also report the filter, if at all possible given
+  the target output format.
+
