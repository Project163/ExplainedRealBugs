+**Please note that overloading `Catch::toString` is currently considered legacy and will not be supported in the next major version of Catch.**
 
-There are some cases where overloading toString does not work as expected. Specialising StringMaker<T> gives you more precise, and reliable, control - but at the cost of slightly more code and complexity:
+## Catch::StringMaker<T> specialisation
+Another way of telling Catch how to convert a type to string is specialising `Catch::StringMaker` template. This allows you to have separate way of stringifying types for Catch, than you have for writing it to a stream and also doesn't require you to declare it before including Catch's header.
