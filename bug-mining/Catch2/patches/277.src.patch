+## Can I compile Catch2 into a dynamic library?
+
+Yes, Catch2 supports the [standard CMake `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`
+option](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html).
+However, the dynamic library support is provided as-is. Catch2 does not
+provide API export annotations, and so you can only use it as a dynamic
+library on platforms that default to public visibility, or with tooling
+support to force export Catch2's API.
