+## Testing your changes
+
+Obviously all changes to Catch's code should be tested. If you added new functionality, you should add tests covering and
+showcasing it. Even if you have only made changes to Catch internals (ie you implemented some performance improvements),
+you should still test your changes.
+
+This means 3 things
+
+* Compiling Catch's SelfTest project -- code that does not compile is evidently incorrect. Obviously, you are not expected to
+have access to all compilers and platforms Catch supports, Catch's CI pipeline will compile your code using supported compilers
+once you open a PR.
+* Running the SelfTest binary. There should be no unexpected failures on simple run.
+* Running Catch's approval tests. Approval tests compare current output of the SelfTest binary in various configurations against
+known good output. Catch's repository provides utility scripts `approvalTests.py` to help you with this. It needs to be passed
+the SelfTest binary compiled with your changes, like so: `$ ./scripts/approvalTests.py clang-build/SelfTest`. The output should
+be fairly self-explanatory.
