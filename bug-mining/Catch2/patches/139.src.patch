+## Installing Catch2 from git repository
+
+If you cannot install Catch2 from a package manager (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04
+provides catch only in version 1.2.0) you might want to install it from
+the repository instead. Assuming you have enough rights, you can just
+install it to the default location, like so:
+```
+$ git clone https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
+$ cd Catch2
+$ cmake -Bbuild -H. -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
+$ sudo cmake --build build/ --target install
+```
+
+If you do not have superuser rights, you will also need to specify
+[CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html)
+when configuring the build, and then modify your calls to
+[find_package](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html)
+accordingly.

 The simplest way to get Catch2 is to download the latest [single header version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catchorg/Catch2/master/single_include/catch2/catch.hpp). The single header is generated by merging a set of individual headers but it is still just normal source code in a header file.
