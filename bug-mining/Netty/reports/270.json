and https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/31716 reports 2 types of problems that can be mostly addressed within Netty itself:\r\n- the former, related http encoders/decoders which accept concrete types with NOT implement specific interfaces\r\n- the latter, related `WebSocketServerExtensionHandler` doing the same for both read/write events\r\n\r\nIn short, the problem, although can become a scalability bottleneck too (more on this later) as https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8180450 is first an efficiency issue dependent by the type check of a concrete type that doesn't implement a given interface type: according to https://github.com/openjdk/jdk11/blob/37115c8ea4aff13a8148ee2b8832b20888a5d880/src/hotspot/cpu/x86/macroAssembler_x86.cpp#L5514 this will cause a wasteful O(n) search among the implemented interfaces per check.\r\nThere are cases that can be solved by using type check against class types or failing fast thanks to singleton(s), known instance refs e.g. empty buffers, etc etc.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8180450 falling into the interface slow path type check confuse profilers enough to not make profiling useful in any form to detect such issues and manual inspection of ASM is still the preferred choice to find performance deficiencies like these (more on this at https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/issues/673 and https://redhatperf.github.io/post/type-check-scalability-issue/).","closed_by":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13268/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
