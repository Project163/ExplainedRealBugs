when passing custom headers to a WebSocketClientHandshaker,\r\nif values are added for headers that are reserved for use in the\r\nwebsocket handshake performed with the server, these custom values can\r\nbe used by the server to compute the websocket handshake challenge. If\r\nthe server computes the response to the challenge with the custom header\r\nvalues, rather than the values computed by the client handshaker, the\r\nhandshake may fail.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nUpdate the client handshaker implementations to add the custom header\r\nvalues first, and then set the reserved websocket header values.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nReserved websocket handshake headers, if present in the custom headers\r\npassed to the client handshaker, will not be propagated to the server.\r\nInstead the client handshaker will propagate the values it generates.\r\n\r\nFixes
