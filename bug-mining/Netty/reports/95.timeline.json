The reason for this problem is that rdata of DNS record cannot be parsed correctly when it contains compressed pointers. Generally, compression pointers are included only when rdata type is text type, such as `NS`, `CNAME` type. In other words, rdata can be parsed correctly only if Dns record type is known in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the original implementation, `DnsRecord` has only three subclasses, `DnsRawRecord`, `DnsPtrRecord` and `DnsOptPseudoRecord`. The text type of `DnsRecord` is currently hold in `DnsRawRecord`. To solve the problem of bad label, there are two solutions:\r\n\r\nThe original implementation of method `decodeRecord` of class `DefaultDnsRecordDecoder`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/00afb19d7a37de21b35ce4f6cb3fa7f74809f2ab/codec-dns/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/dns/DefaultDnsRecordDecoder.java#L89-L103\r\n\r\n**Solution1**: In the `decodeRecord` method of class `DefaultDnsRecordDecoder`, a new if branch is added to decode the record of text type. This approach has minimal impact on current implementations, but it should not be a good design. If you need to decode other types of records later, you need to add a new if branch.\r\n```java\r\nprotected DnsRecord decodeRecord(\r\n            String name, DnsRecordType type, int dnsClass, long timeToLive,\r\n            ByteBuf in, int offset, int length) throws Exception {\r\n\tif (type == DnsRecordType.PTR) {\r\n\t\treturn new DefaultDnsPtrRecord(\r\n\t\t                    name, dnsClass, timeToLive, decodeName0(in.duplicate().setIndex(offset, offset + length)));\r\n\t}\r\n  \tif (type == DnsRecordType.NS || type ==  DnsRecordType.CNAME /** || more types... */) {\r\n        // decode normal text rdata or compressed pointer text rdata\r\n        // return DnsRawRecord\r\n    }\r\n\treturn new DefaultDnsRawRecord(\r\n\t                name, type, dnsClass, timeToLive, in.retainedDuplicate().setIndex(offset, offset + length));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Solution2**: Add an RData decoder for each type of `DnsRecord`, This method has been implemented in PR #9084 . If a new type of RData needs to be decoded, then only one decoder needs to be added and registered. But this will break some of the APIs and implementations\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprotected DnsRecord decodeRecord(\r\n            String name, DnsRecordType type, int dnsClass, long timeToLive,\r\n            ByteBuf in, int offset, int length) throws Exception {\r\n\tByteBuf rData = in.duplicate().setIndex(offset, offset + length);\r\n\t// Get the corresponding RData decoder by type\r\n\tDnsRDataDecoder<? extends DnsRecord> rDataDecoder = DnsRDataCodecs.rDataDecoder(type);\r\n\tif (rDataDecoder != null) {\r\n\t\treturn rDataDecoder.decodeRData(name, dnsClass, timeToLive, rData);\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn new DefaultDnsRawRecord(name, type, dnsClass, timeToLive, rData.retain());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWDYT？Which way is
