It took me time to debug and notice that one of its fields was an object that didnt implement Serializable.\r\n\r\nThats why i just throw some suggestion to add into \"Objectecho Example\" some new user friendly code to inform about it like:\r\n\r\n**1)** some \"Objectecho Example\"  class extending ObjectEncoder:\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean acceptOutboundMessage(Object msg) throws Exception {\r\n        if(!super.acceptOutboundMessage(msg)){\r\n            // some information\r\n        }\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**OR**\r\n\r\n(i didnt try enable Asserts, so if you use some, this option might be better)\r\n**2)** **Just add comment about it**, to let new users know they will receive NO information when trying to send complex Objects that in some depth contains non-serializable Object.\r\n\r\n**Please note this refer only to \"Objectecho Example\"  and Encoder (so its client side).** \r\n\r\nJust thought it could be helpfull for new users having same problem.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n- some warning/error/information for \"Objectecho Example\"  if there is missing Serializable\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n- Demo give NO information if sent object do not match, client and server print **no information/warning/error at all.**\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- in \"Objectecho Example\"  try sent Serializable object with not serializable Object in it, it will not be sent and no information will be printed anywhere. Also comments do not mention anything about it.\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.43\r\n\r\nAnd ofc, hello to netty users/devs ;)\r\n\r\nPlease close it if \"Objectecho Example\" is not prepared for new users and its for testing purpose, or if you think its not needed, since its just suggestion.","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10777/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
