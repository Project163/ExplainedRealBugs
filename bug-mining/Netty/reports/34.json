a non-modular library (e.g. built for JDK8 or JDK9) is used within a modular JDK9 application, Java creates an automatic module for it. Modules should be named from the root packages they own, but the default algorithm uses JAR file name instead. If Netty migrates to JDK9 and Jigsaw one day, this may cause serious dependency issues (JVM will refuse to start, if the same module is required with two different names, e.g. `netty` and `io.netty`).\r\n\r\nIt is possible to specify the automatic module name explicitly through a Manifest entry `Automatic-Module-Name`, while the project is still built against JDK7.\r\n\r\nI suggest to add `Automatic-Module-Name` to the manifests to acquire your root packages as module names, since JDK9 is going to be released within a few days.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/7218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/7218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
