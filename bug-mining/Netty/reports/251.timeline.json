NPE could occur when forEachByte was called on nested leak-aware composite byte buffers.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nWrappedCompositeByteBuf extends CompositeByteBuf but must delegate all calls to the wrapped instance. Add delegation calls for forEachByteAsc0 and forEachByteDesc0. Without delegation, those calls would, from an outer composite buffer, go to the composite structure of the wrapper buffer, which have no components.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nNo more NPE when calling forEachByte on nested composite leak-aware buffers.\r\n\r\nFixes
