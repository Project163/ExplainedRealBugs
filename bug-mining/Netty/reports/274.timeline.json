when leak tracking is set to SIMPLE or ADVANCED, and a derived buffer is created, the buffer is selected for leak tracking if the parent buffer is tracked and the derived buffer is also selected by an independent roll of the dice. As a result, deeply derived buffers are exponentially less likely to be selected for leak tracking. This makes it difficult to find and diagnose leaks related to such buffers.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nWhen a derived buffer is created, and the parent buffer has leak tracking, the derived buffer now always has leak tracking applied.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nLeaks of derived buffers are easier to find.
