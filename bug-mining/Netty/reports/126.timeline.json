optimization #9765 introduced a bug where the native indices of the internal reused duplicate nio buffer are not properly reset prior to using it to copy data during a reallocation operation.

available.\r\n\r\nModification\r\n\r\nEnsure `ByteBuffer#clear()` is always called on the reused internal nio buffer prior to returning it from `PooledByteBuf#internalNioBuffer()` (protected method);
