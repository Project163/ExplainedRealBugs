the changes in the `Recycler`, `Recycler$LocalPool.release` often appear in heavy load scenarios even for cases where the buffer is not escaping the event loop it has reused it.\r\n\r\nThe orginal `Recycler` implementation was very complex and with some wider effects on GC, hence I still think it was the right move, but according to the profiling data the JCTools offering (based on a atomic CAS) is still too much costy. \r\nI suggest to record some information re the event loop where the allocation first happen and use a (event loop)-local stack/queue where short-circuit the buffer recycling.\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n- allocation happen from event loop X: always use the event-loop-local pool first. If empty, use the \"shared\" one using the JCTools q (using relaxed poll, pretty cheap)\r\n- if release happen on the same originating event loop, there's no need to use any atomic construct and can release it to the event-loop-local pool (if not full? I'm open to suggestions here) or fall-back to the shared one, based on some policy.\r\n\r\nIt's not nice to have 2 separate structures, but the benefit from common usages should be significant ","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
