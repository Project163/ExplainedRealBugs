sometimes make use of FastThreadLocalThreads outside of event-loops, e.g. for task-offload, or to make ues of Netty's thread-locals. Our Blockhound integration is currently preventing these threads from performing blocking calls, which is overly restrictive.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nAdd an escape hatch for subclasses of FastThreadLocalThread to permit blocking calls.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nIt is now possible to use FastThreadLocalThreads outside of event-loops, make use of blocking calls, and not be flagged by Blockhound.\r\n\r\nFixes

Motivation\n\nOur test suite uses an embedded Vert.x server:\nhttps://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/main/junit/mockwebserver/src/main/java/io/fabric8/mockwebserver/MockWebServer.java#L83\n\nVert.x utilizes `FastThreadLocalThread` for its blocking worker threads:\n- https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/blob/a4eaffdd9ead88d17a51d40480f9032dfe02e962/vertx-core/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/impl/VertxImpl.java#L201\n- https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/blob/a4eaffdd9ead88d17a51d40480f9032dfe02e962/vertx-core/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/impl/VertxThread.java#L23\n\nHowever, Netty's `BlockHoundIntegration` classifies `FastThreadLocalThread` as non-blocking by default:\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.2/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/internal/Hidden.java#L189\n\nThis results in Vert.x’s blocking threads being incorrectly treated as non-blocking by BlockHound. Currently:\n- There's no way to exclude or override the classification made by a third-party integration.\n- While we can add custom non-blocking thread predicates, we cannot force-mark specific threads as blocking.\n\n### Suggestion\n\nIntroduce a method like `BlockHound.Builder.blockingThreadPredicate(...)` to allow users to explicitly mark certain threads as blocking, even if third-party integrations consider them non-blocking.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/BlockHound/issues/516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/BlockHound/issues/516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
