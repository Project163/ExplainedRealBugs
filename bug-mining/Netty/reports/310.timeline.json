a derived, pooled buffer holds a reference to a parent and is released, the buffer instance is returned to a class-specific recycler. The recycler retains a strong reference to the buffer. If the parent has a resource leak, the recycled buffer still has a reference to the parent which prevents GC of the parent and thus leak detection.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nClear the reference to the parent and rootParent on deallocate.\r\n\r\nI don't think a test is feasible, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nThe parent becomes unreferenced, gets GCed, and triggers leak detection.\r\n\r\nFixes

**User description**\n<!-- Korbit AI PR Description Start -->\n## Description by Korbit AI\n\n### What change is being made?\n\nAdd null checks in `unwrap()` to prevent `IllegalReferenceCountException` by throwing it when `rootParent` is null and update `deallocate()` to nullify `parent` and `rootParent` to facilitate garbage collection.\n\n### Why are these changes being made?\n\nThese changes ensure proper exception handling by throwing an `IllegalReferenceCountException` when expected conditions are not met, preventing potential misuse. Nullifying `parent` and `rootParent` for garbage collection helps address a possible memory leak issue, as reported in netty/netty#14247, ensuring that the memory is cleaned up properly and improving overall memory management.\n\n> Is this description stale?
