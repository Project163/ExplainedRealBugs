(See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/3548)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nSend a RST_STREAM frame to a remote endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1.23.Final\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\nJava 8\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nAny (observed on Mac and Linux).\r\n\r\nFor a bit more context. Sending a RST_STREAM will eventually trigger this code in Http2ConnectionHandler, https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/Http2ConnectionHandler.java#L589 . This removes the stream from the active streams metadata and any subsequent DATA frames that come in will be considered as an unknown stream. I was thinking we could just check if the stream may have existed and if so just ignore the DATA frame altogether. So instead of [this](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/501662a77f8166382eefd18a8620983d27f59d4a/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder.java#L535) do something like this\r\n\r\n```java\r\nverifyStreamMayHaveExisted(streamId);\r\nreturn true;\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8025/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
