configured `DnsNameResolverBuilder#TTLs` (`minTtl`, `maxTtl` and `negativeTtl`) are used for creating default `resolveCache`, `cnameCache` and `authoritativeDnsServerCache`. Configuring a custom `resolveCache`(or `cnameCache`, or `authoritativeDnsServerCache`) does not mean that `TTLs` are not needed anymore for the rest of the caches that are not configured. With the current implementation there is no way for the user to specify a custom `resolveCache`, but to leave `Netty` to create `cnameCache` and `authoritativeDnsServerCache`.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- `DnsNameResolverBuilder` does not throw `IllegalStateException`, but logs when a custom `resolveCache`/`cnameCache`/`authoritativeDnsServerCache` and `TTLs` are configured, indicating that for the custom `resolveCache`/`cnameCache`/`authoritativeDnsServerCache`, the `TTLs` will be ignored.\r\n- junit tests are added\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFixes #13384\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1550803515","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13384#issuecomment-1550803515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13384","id":1550803515,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c85cb2I7","user":{"login":"violetagg","id":696661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjY2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg","html_url":"https://github.com/violetagg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetagg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-17T06:20:01Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T06:20:01Z","body":"@trustin I think it is a bit inconvenient to have configured either all types of caches or to leave them all default based on the TTLs.
