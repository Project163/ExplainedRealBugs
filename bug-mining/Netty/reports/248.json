I'm not completely certain this is a common scenario, we observed this failure on upgrading to Netty `4.1.80` and when using a custom bundle for a private key.\r\n\r\nFrom a quick glance, it looks like it should be resolved by ensuring that the input stream passed to the `BouncyCastlePemReader` is a copy, and processed independently of the original stream processed by `PemReader`\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1.80 w/ tcnative 2.0.54\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\nopenjdk version \"17.0.4\" 2022-07-19 LTS\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe PR https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12670 introduced a change that enforces eager parsing by `BouncyCastlePemReader` when the classpath includes the `BouncyCastleProvider`\r\n\r\nThe intended behavior should be the fallback to `PemReader` kicking in when the key type does not match one of the supported variants.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIn the case where there is a `BouncyCastleProvider` on the classpath, but the key type is of a format that is not supported by `BouncyCastlePemReader`, the **input stream has already been read**.\r\n\r\nThis renders the fallback to trigger, but fails decoding. \r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Input stream does not contain valid private key.\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContextBuilder.keyManager(SslContextBuilder.java:416)\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContextBuilder.keyManager(SslContextBuilder.java:341)\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContextBuilder.forServer(SslContextBuilder.java:84)\r\n....\r\nCaused by: java.security.KeyException: could not find a PKCS #8 private key in input stream (see https://netty.io/wiki/sslcontextbuilder-and-private-key.html for more information)\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.PemReader.keyNotFoundException(PemReader.java:156)\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.PemReader.readPrivateKey(PemReader.java:137)\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext.toPrivateKey(SslContext.java:1152)\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContextBuilder.keyManager(SslContextBuilder.java:414)\r\n```\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nUse a key with a format not supported  by the `BouncyCastlePemReader`, and trigger the fallback logic.","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12745/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
