Version: OpenSSL 1.0.2j\r\nOS: macOS Sierra 10.12.3\r\n\r\nWhen a renegotiation is initiated a 33 byte payload is generated by OpenSSL. If the BIO doesn't have enough space to hold 33 bytes then OpenSSL will not attempt to re-write the remaining bytes after space becomes available in the BIO. I am developing a custom BIO implementation and documentation is sparse so it is very possible I'm using the OpenSSL APIs incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce (Use a BIO which has 32 bytes free space)\r\n1. Complete a handshake\r\n2. Server initiates a renegotiation (calls `SSL_renegotiate`, returns `1`)\r\n3. Server calls `SSL_do_handshake` (attempts to write `33` bytes into the BIO but only is able to write `32` bytes, returns `-1`, `SSL_get_error` returns `SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE`)\r\n- OpenSSL attempts to write the `1` remaining byte which wouldn't fit and my custom BIO calls `BIO_set_retry_write(bio)` and return `-1`.\r\n4. Server calls `SSL_set_state(SSL_ST_ACCEPT)`\r\n5. Server calls `SSL_do_handshake` (returns `-1`, `SSL_get_error` returns `SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ`)\r\n- OpenSSL attempts to read from the BIO, but my custom BIO has nothing to read so calls `BIO_set_retry_read(bio)` and returns `-1` \r\n6. Server reads the `32` pending bytes from the BIO. The BIO now has 32 bytes of free space.\r\n7. Server calls `SSL_do_handshake` (returns `-1`, `SSL_get_error` returns `SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ`)\r\n- OpenSSL tries to read from the BIO. I would expect OpenSSL to try to write the `1` byte which has not been written.\r\n\r\nI also have a code reproducer, but the code involves Java & JNI (https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6201).

Netty utilizes BIO_new_bio_pair so we can control all FD lifetime and event notification but delegates to OpenSSL for encryption/decryption. The current implementation sets up a pair of BIO buffers to read/write encrypted/plaintext data. This approach requires copying of data from Java ByteBuffers to native memory BIO buffers, and also requires both BIO buffers to be sufficiently large to hold application data. If direct ByteBuffers are used we can avoid coyping to/from the intermediate BIO buffer and just read/write directly from the direct ByteBuffer memory. We still need an internal buffer because OpenSSL may generate write data as a result of read calls (e.g. handshake, alerts, renegotiation, etc..), but this buffer doesn't have to be be large enough to

you try to build 2.0.0.Final with OpenSSL 1.1.0e you get a few errors:\r\n- You can no longer access `SSL_CIPHER->algorithm_mkey` and `SSL_CIPHER->algorithm_auth` they are replaced with `SSL_CIPHER_get_kx_nid` and `SSL_CIPHER_get_auth_nid`. Also Kerberos was removed, so `SSL_TXT_KRB5` was not found\r\n- `X509_STORE_CTX->untrusted` is also not accessible and replaced with `X509_STORE_CTX_get0_untrusted`\r\n- `SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh` changed its behavior. It now sets the supported curves. Which will cause errors like [this](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/2006). Related [Manual](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Manual:SSL_CTX_set1_curves(3)#NOTES) and [OpenSSL issue](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/1437) \r\n- `SSL_CTX_new(TLSvXX_method());` is deprecated and was replaced with the new `SSL_CTX_new(TLS_method())` [Manual](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_CTX_new.html#HISTORY)\r\nThis is hacky as `io.netty.handler.ssl.OpenSsl#doesSupportProtocol` also uses `SSL_CTX_new` to test for supported protocols, but for basic support of OpenSSL 1.1.0 it works. \r\n\r\nFurthermore in OpenSSL 1.1.0 the way protocols are enable/disabled changes (SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3,... are deprecated and you should use [this](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_max_proto_version.html) instead).

is the minimum number of changes necessary to remove the calls to `SSL.setState()`, which are causing problems for `netty-tcnative` building on modern linux distributions.\r\n\r\n~~I haven't signed the contributor license agreement~~. I have signed the individual contributor license agreement.\r\n\r\nPlease read the associated ticket (#6320) for some discussion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Motivation:\r\n\r\n`SSL.setState()` has gone from openssl 1.1. Calling it is, and probably always has been, incorrect. Doing renogitation in this manner is potentially insecure. There have been at least two insecure renegotiation vulnerabilities in users of the OpenSSL library.\r\n\r\nRenegotiation is not necessary for correct operation of the TLS protocol.\r\n\r\nBoringSSL has already eliminated this functionality, and the tests (now deleted) were not running on BoringSSL.\r\n\r\n### Modifications:\r\n\r\nIf the connection setup has completed, always return that negotiation is not supported. Previously this was done only if we were the client.\r\n\r\nRemove the tests for this functionality.\r\n\r\n### Result:\r\n\r\nFixes #6320.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/7544/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/7544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1400420409,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0MDA0MjA0MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1400420409","actor":{"login":"FauxFaux","id":328180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODE4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux","html_url":"https://github.com/FauxFaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cd70816b6273041220e7e3cd30efbe4052155416","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FauxFaux/netty/commits/cd70816b6273041220e7e3cd30efbe4052155416","created_at":"2017-12-23T15:36:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1400604239,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0MDA2MDQyMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1400604239","actor":{"login":"FauxFaux","id":328180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODE4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux","html_url":"https://github.com/FauxFaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ef3b92c8c30100f65ffdd27c72795c4faf5e97de","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FauxFaux/netty-tcnative/commits/ef3b92c8c30100f65ffdd27c72795c4faf5e97de","created_at":"2017-12-24T10:23:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1400606510,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0MDA2MDY1MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1400606510","actor":{"login":"FauxFaux","id":328180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODE4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux","html_url":"https://github.com/FauxFaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1a92c8d6e9e9daf813664e769816025a3dbd4334","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FauxFaux/netty-tcnative/commits/1a92c8d6e9e9daf813664e769816025a3dbd4334","created_at":"2017-12-24T10:38:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1400606699,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0MDA2MDY2OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1400606699","actor":{"login":"FauxFaux","id":328180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODE4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux","html_url":"https://github.com/FauxFaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FauxFaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://ap
