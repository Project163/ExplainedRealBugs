course)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1288561293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vietj","id":225674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj","html_url":"https://github.com/vietj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7651247691,"node_id":"MEE_lADOABA-c85Ug8I8zwAAAAHIDMZL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/7651247691","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-24T07:45:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7651247698,"node_id":"SE_lADOABA-c85Ug8I8zwAAAAHIDMZS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/7651247698","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-24T07:45:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7653891308,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA-c85Ug8I8zwAAAAHINRzs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/7653891308","actor":{"login":"vietj","id":225674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj","html_url":"https://github.com/vietj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-24T13:16:22Z","state_reason":"not_planned","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://g

doesn't support sharing the input buffers since the input buffers get mutated. This issue has been reported as #14069. Fixes have already been made to support the use case using read-only buffers as input. However, this is not useful for existing Netty applications.\r\n\r\nI checked the Netty code once again and noticed that it's possible to optimize the current implementation in SslHandler and avoid the buffer mutation.\r\n\r\nThe default behavior in SslHandler causes very hard to debug problems. In Pulsar, there have been issues open for multiple years that have been caused by the SslHandler's default behavior of mutating the input buffers (apache/pulsar#22601 is one starting point to the issues). \r\n\r\nThe current implementation of SslHandler will mutate the input buffers by using the input buffer as a cumulation buffer when there's available capacity. This is not optimal at all. This PR contains an improvement where the cumulation buffer is allocated to the final size immediately so that cumulation is more optimal. That's why I think that this will be more optimal in the end and won't cause performance regressions.\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, it should be possible to pass a slice or duplicate of a buffer and the input buffer doesn't get mutated. The input buffer's readIndex will be modified so multiple threads cannot share the same input buffer without a slice or duplicate.\r\n\r\nI created a failing test case that shows that a duplicate buffer doesn't prevent input buffer mutation.\r\n![image](https://github.com/netty/netty/assets/66864/0abec333-6079-40bd-8bc1-ccfd3df6fae1)\r\nIt's a very surprising behavior of SslHandler that passing a `.retainedDuplicate()` buffer could result in mutations to the original buffer. That's another reason why I think that SslHandler shouldn't ever mutate the inputs.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\n- add `protected ByteBuf composeFirst(ByteBufAllocator allocator, ByteBuf first, int bufferSize)` to AbstractCoalescingBufferQueue to support allocating an optimal cumulation buffer instead of using the input buffer as a cumulation buffer\r\n- remove dead code from `compose` where there was handling for CompositeByteBuf\r\n  - `composeFirst` will be called before `compose` so this case isn't needed.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #14069 without the need to set the input buffer as

issue https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/12919 is titled \"ByteBuf slice duplicates are not slices\". This behavior is very surprising. It explains why the SslHandler has been causing issues in Apache Pulsar. The incoming messages come from the network and use the LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder, which slices the buffer into frame buffers. Pulsar later calls retainedDuplicate. This removes the effect of slicing (as described in issue https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/12919) and makes the buffer writable. The impact of this is that the original buffer used by the LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder gets mutated by the SslHandler later when the sliced frame buffer (which is made writable with .retainedDuplicate) is passed to the Apache Bookkeeper client, which also uses Netty and contains an SslHandler. The SslHandler's cumulation in the attemptCopyToCumulation method thinks that it's fine to mutate the input buffer since it's writable and that's what causes data corruption.\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/12919 references the vert.x issue https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/4509. It seems vert.x applied a workaround in https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/4517.\r\n\r\nI also found a workaround for a data corruption issue within Netty's http codecs, https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11802. That was to address https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/11792.\r\n\r\nSuch workarounds won't be needed when we eliminate the surprising behaviour. The PR will address it for Sslhandler and also optimise the cumulation. I think https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/12919 should also be addressed so that a duplicating a slice doesn't provide write access to the parent buffer outside of the slice.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nFor sliced buffers, make the `duplicate()` method duplicate the slice and not the underlying buffer.\r\nWhen I was working on the changes, I noticed that `io.netty.buffer.AdaptivePoolingAllocator.PooledNonRetainedSlicedByteBuf` had already implemented `duplicate` so that it duplicates the slice and not the underlying buffer:\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/ecebe1c102cf9a9e2faaccbfc12f594963af7326/buffer/src/main/java/io/netty/buffer/AdaptivePoolingAllocator.java#L1238-L1242\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes  #12919.\r\n\r\nIf there is no issue then describe the changes introduced by this PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14093/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14093/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/2144330696","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/12919#issuecomment-2144330696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12919","id":2144330696,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c85_z-PI","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T05:50:21Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T05:50:21Z","body":"I
