Expected behavior\r\n\r\nDNS resolver does not leak direct memory when buffers are freed correctly.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nMemory is leaked, JVM runs out of direct memory.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error] Exception in thread \"main\" io.netty.resolver.dns.DnsNameResolverException: [/10.0.2.3:53] failed to send a query via UDP (no stack trace available)\r\n[error] Caused by: io.netty.handler.codec.EncoderException: io.netty.util.internal.OutOfDirectMemoryError: failed to allocate 16777216 byte(s) of direct memory (used: 234881024, max: 239075328)\r\n```\r\nfull stacktrace: https://gist.github.com/dziemba/ffeb8f2c3b131a74c042746151ac05c0\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Use `DnsNameResolver.resolveAll` to query SRV records for a name that contains a lot of answers (e.g. `hugedns.test.dziemba.net`)\r\n-  Run query repeatedly and `.release()` returned DNS records. \r\n- Watch java process memory usage increase until it finally throws with `io.netty.util.internal.OutOfDirectMemoryError`\r\n\r\nIt might be important that the DNS response is large so it gets truncated and then retried via TCP.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/dziemba/c904d227d105b6fc7cf00495257fbb40\r\n- run with `-Xmx128m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=4m` to make it fail quickly\r\n- will fail as described after around 100-200 iterations (with above settings)\r\n- sometimes it fails with actual network errors, re-run a few times if that happens\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n`4.1.42.Final`\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n```\r\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_222\"\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 1.8.0_222-b10)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 25.222-b10, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was not able to reproduce this on Java 11 or 12.\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nDarwin wopro3 18.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.7.0: Tue Aug 20 16:57:14 PDT 2019; root:xnu-4903.271.2~2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tried to reproduce this on Linux. It shows the same error behavior (fails after 100 runs of the test script) but does not output the `OutOfDirectMemoryError` for some reason...","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
