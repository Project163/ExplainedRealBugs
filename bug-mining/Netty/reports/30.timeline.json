is unable to take advantage of JDK9's built-in ALPN support.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nWhen running on JDK9 or later, Netty will invoke Java's built-in methods\r\nfor specifying the supported (server) or requested (client) application\r\nlayer protocols and for obtaining the negotiated protocol after the\r\nhandshake has taken place. The relevant methods are new in Java 9, so\r\nthey are called using core reflection. As all of the methods in question\r\nare public, there are no issues involving security, Jigsaw\r\nencapsulation, or even performance (as all the Method instances are\r\ncached in static final fields).\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFixes
