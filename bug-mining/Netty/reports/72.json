Expected behavior\r\nExecution instead throws `RejectedExecutionException`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThere is a racy `UnsupportedOperationException` instead because the task removal is delegated to `MpscChunkedArrayQueue` that does not support removal. This happens with `SingleThreadEventExecutor` that overrides the `newTaskQueue` to return an MPSC queue instead of the `LinkedBlockingQueue` returned by the base class such as `NioEventLoop`, `EpollEventLoop` and `KQueueEventLoop`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nSchedule task to an event loop concurrently to an event loop shutdown.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n```\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testTaskRemovalOnShutdownThrowsUnsupportedOperationException() throws Exception {\r\n        NioEventLoopGroup group = new NioEventLoopGroup(1);\r\n        final NioEventLoop loop = (NioEventLoop) group.next();\r\n        final Runnable task = new Runnable() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                try {\r\n                    Thread.sleep(1);\r\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                    e.printStackTrace();\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        new Thread() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                while (true) {\r\n                    loop.execute(task);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }.start();\r\n        Thread.sleep(10);\r\n        loop.shutdownNow();\r\n        Thread.sleep(100000);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is a racy test, the event loop shutdown race against the the task producing thread, if you run it enough it will fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"Thread-0\" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException\r\n\tat org.jctools.queues.BaseMpscLinkedArrayQueue.iterator(BaseMpscLinkedArrayQueue.java:201)\r\n\tat java.util.AbstractCollection.remove(AbstractCollection.java:282)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.removeTask(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:340)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.execute(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:781)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoopTest$8.run(NioEventLoopTest.java:195)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\nAt least 4.1.x\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nN/A","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
