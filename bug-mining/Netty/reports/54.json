Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen stream 1 is created from a h2c upgrade, the resultant stream should signal that it has sent the headers for the client, and that it has received the headers for the server.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe stream state doesn't acknowledge that the request headers have been sent/received.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\nAdd the following test cases to the Http2ConnectionHandlerTest suite:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void clientUpgradeSetsStreamHeadersSent() throws Exception {\r\n        when(local.createStream(STREAM_ID, true)).thenReturn(stream);\r\n        handler = newHandler();\r\n        handler.onHttpClientUpgrade();\r\n        Http2Stream upgradeStream = handler.connection().stream(HTTP_UPGRADE_STREAM_ID);\r\n        assertSame(stream, upgradeStream);\r\n        verify(stream).headersSent(false);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void serverUpgradeSetsStreamHeadersReceived() throws Exception {\r\n        when(connection.isServer()).thenReturn(true);\r\n        when(remote.createStream(STREAM_ID, true)).thenReturn(stream);\r\n
