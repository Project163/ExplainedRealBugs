Motivation:\r\n\r\nIntroduction of `WebSocketDecoderConfig` made our server-side code more elegant and simpler for support.\r\n\r\nHowever there is still some problem with maintenance and new features development for WebSocket codecs (`WebSocketServerProtocolHandler`, `WebSocketServerProtocolHandler`).\r\n\r\nParticularly, it makes me ~~crying with blood~~ extremely sad to add new parameter and yet another one constructor into these handlers, when I want to contribute new feature.\r\n\r\n### Modification:\r\n\r\nI've extracted all parameters for client and server WebSocket handlers into config/builder structures, like it was made for decoders in PR #9116.\r\n\r\n### Result:\r\n\r\n* Fixes #9698: Simplify WebSocket handlers constructor arguments hell\r\n* Unblock further development in this module (configurable close frame handling on server-side; automatic close-frame sending, when missed; memory leaks on protocol violations; etc...)\r\n\r\nBonuses:\r\n\r\n* All defaults are gathered in one place and could be easily found/reused.\r\n* New API greatly simplifies usage, but does NOT allow inheritance or modification.\r\n* New API would simplify long-term maintenance of WebSockets module.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n    WebSocketClientProtocolConfig config = WebSocketClientProtocolConfig.newBuilder()\r\n        .webSocketUri(\"wss://localhost:8443/fx-spot\")\r\n        .subprotocol(\"trading\")\r\n        .handshakeTimeoutMillis(15000L)\r\n        .build();\r\n    ctx.pipeline().addLast(new
