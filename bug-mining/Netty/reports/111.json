Specifically this line, because the `aEnd` variable is 0 when the Content-Type header starts with a semicolon: https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/00afb19d7a37de21b35ce4f6cb3fa7f74809f2ab/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/multipart/HttpPostRequestDecoder.java#L278.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Make a request to a Netty HTTP server and pass a Content-Type header that starts with a semicolon `;`. I'm not sure if there are HTTP clients that would sanitize this for you and prevent the problem, but I was able to reproduce this with `RestAssured` and a Netty `Bootstrap` acting as a HTTP Client via `HttpClientCodec`, so there are at least a few clients you can use to reproduce.\r\n2. In the Netty server that receives the request, call `HttpPostRequestDecoder.isMultipart(HttpRequest)` or any other code path that ultimately causes `HttpPostRequestDecoder.splitHeaderContentType(String)` to be called with the request's Content-Type header.\r\n3. You'll see a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` get thrown.\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n`4.1.30.Final` (probably others as well)","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8554/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
