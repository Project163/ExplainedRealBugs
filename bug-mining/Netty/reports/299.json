I'm new to netty and when I was browsing the code I found the following code in `JdkSslServerContext.java` [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/handler/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/ssl/JdkSslServerContext.java#L334):\r\n```java\r\n            ctx.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(),\r\n                    wrapTrustManagerIfNeeded(trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers()),\r\n                     null);\r\n```\r\nThe code here use a \"null\", which means using the default securerandom. Although securerandom has already provided enough security, specifying one will ensure better security. For example, using SunJSSE.cryptoProvider for fip mode will be better.
