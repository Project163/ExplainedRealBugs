Regardless, new tests that are only added to the `master` branch can immediately use the new JUnit 5 test APIs.\r\n\r\nSome benefits I anticipate are:\r\n\r\n1. Some tests will become easier to write, because JUnit 5 is more capable at expressing nesting of tests, and parameterisations.\r\n2. Builds should complete faster because JUnit 5 is better able to run tests in parallel. This is something that needs to be enabled explicitly, however, since it can cause latent test isolation failures to pop up.\r\n3. JUnit 5 is extensible enough that something like `TimedOutTestsListener` won't need to live in the `netty-build` anymore.\r\n\r\nA drawback I can think of is that forward porting changes to a JUnit 4 test in Netty `4.1`, to a migrated JUnit 5 test in `master`, will be more challenging and add to the workload of doing changes in `4.1`.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think?","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
