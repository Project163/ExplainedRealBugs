In k8s environment, the concatenation of the hostname and searchDomain, can cause the DNS cache to become ineffective. I think if searchDomains are concatenated during DNS resolution, we should iterate through and concatenate all searchDomains to obtain the cached results.\r\n\r\n   eg. \r\n   hostname: k8s service name\r\n![image-20240510234145365](https://github.com/netty/netty/assets/65326092/9294e011-80d2-412e-933e-21d2daa65718)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Each EpollEventLoop has its own DNS resolution cache, but when DNS resolution is executed in an EpollEventLoop that does not have a cached result, it can cause the DNS resolution cache to become ineffective.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a potential bug.
