 \r\n\r\n\tI see that code annotation and iss,but i think, \r\n\tcode 'if (ctx.isRemoved()) {break;}' is to exit the 'while (in.isReadable())' loop,it work good.\r\n\r\n\tmy ISS means,when we remove this decoder, 'webInStream' has byte data and 'out List' has decoded data,we should fire 'out List' before 'webInStream'\r\n\tOtherwise, it will lead to disorder.\r\n\r\n```\r\n while (in.isReadable()) {\r\n                int outSize = out.size();\r\n\r\n                if (outSize > 0) {\r\n                    fireChannelRead(ctx, out, outSize);\r\n                    out.clear();\r\n\r\n                    // Check if this handler was removed before continuing with decoding.\r\n                    // If it was removed, it is not safe to continue to operate on the buffer.\r\n                    //\r\n                    // See:\r\n                    // - https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4635\r\n                    if (ctx.isRemoved()) {\r\n                        break;\r\n                    }\r\n                    outSize = 0;\r\n
