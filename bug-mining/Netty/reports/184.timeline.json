from reactor-netty 0.9 to 1.0 \r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nI expected Webclient http calls working correctly like the previous version of Netty Reactor 0.9.13.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nSince updating to Spring Boot 2.4.x, the version of Netty changed for 1.x.x, and there are problems of DNS resolution.\r\n\r\nDepending of the URL endpoint (endpoint in public Internet or endpoint in the company network), it's could work or not.\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 local machine (with AdoptOpenJdk 11.0.4.11 hotspot) : DNS resolution OK for public internet endpoints / KO for internal company endpoints\r\n- Docker container linux-based (with adoptopenjdk:11.0.7_10-jre-hotspot): DNS resolution KO for public internet endpoints / OK for internal company endpoints\r\n\r\n\r\n### WebClient
