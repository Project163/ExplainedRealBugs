could handle \"connection\" or \"te\" headers more gently when\r\nconverting from http/1.1 to http/2 headers.  Http/2 headers don't\r\nsupport single-hop headers, so when we convert from http/1.1 to http/2,\r\nwe should drop all single-hop headers.  This includes headers like\r\n\"transfer-encoding\" and \"connection\", but also the headers that\r\n\"connection\" points to, since \"connection\" can be used to designate\r\nother headers as single-hop headers.  For the \"te\" header, we can more\r\npermissively convert it by just dropping non-conforming headers (ie\r\nnon-\"trailers\" headers) which is what we do for all other headers when\r\nwe convert.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nAdd a new blacklist to the http/1.1 to http/2 conversion, which is\r\nconstructed from the values of the \"connection\" header, and stop\r\nthrowing an exception when a \"te\" header is passed with a non-\"trailers\"\r\nvalue.  Instead, drop all values except for \"trailers\".  Add unit tests\r\nfor \"connection\" and \"te\" headers when converting from http/1.1 to http/2.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nThis will improve the h2c upgrade request, and also conversions from\r\nhttp/1.1 to http/2.  This will simplify implementing spec-compliant\r\nhttp/2 servers that want to share code between their http/1.1 and http/2\r\nimplementations.\r\n\r\n[Fixes
