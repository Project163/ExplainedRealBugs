of all — thanks for adding the **active thread count metric** in [#15617](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15617)\nIt’s been very helpful for tracking how auto-scaling behaves in production \n\nWhile testing it, we noticed one edge case:\nWhen the server starts but no requests have come in yet, some `SingleThreadEventExecutor`s stay in `ST_NOT_STARTED`, and the scaling logic doesn’t kick in.\nBasically, `activeExecutorCount` never updates until the first task runs.\n\nHere’s what seems to be happening inside `trySuspend()`:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic boolean trySuspend() {\n    if (supportSuspension) {\n        if (STATE_UPDATER.compareAndSet(this, ST_STARTED, ST_SUSPENDING)) {\n            wakeup(inEventLoop());\n            return true;\n        }\n        int currentState = state;\n        return currentState == ST_SUSPENDED || currentState == ST_SUSPENDING;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nSince the CAS only works from `ST_STARTED → ST_SUSPENDING`, it fails when the executor is still `ST_NOT_STARTED`.\n\nIdeally, executors in ST_NOT_STARTED should not be counted as active in the active executor count,\nso that the scaling logic can accurately reflect how many threads are actually running.\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15758/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
