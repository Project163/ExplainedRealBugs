Sometimes, headers\r\nwhich are substantively less than the header list size will be measured\r\nas longer than the header list size.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nKeep better track of the nameLength of a given name, so that we don't\r\naccidentally end up reusing a nameLength.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nMore consistent measurement of header list size.\r\n\r\nFixes #7511.
