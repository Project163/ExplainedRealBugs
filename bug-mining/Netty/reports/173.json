Behavior\r\nIt looks like it's not possible to create an mqtt message (with packetId) through the provided _builder classes_ in `io.netty.handler.codec.mqtt.MqttMessageBuilders`\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is happening is because the internal representation of the packetId (in `PubAckBuilder`, `SubAckBuilder` and `UnsubAckBuilder`) is a `short`, not an `int`.\r\nSo this means that whatever value >32767 is converted to negative when entering the builder classes, and remains a negative `int` in the underlying `MqttMessageIdVariableHeader` of the message.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nJust try to create an mqtt SubAck message using `io.netty.handler.codec.mqtt.SubAckBuilder` with `.packetId(36000)`\r\nIt will throw an exception saying the packetId needs to be between 1 and 65535.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10930\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1.58.Final\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java
