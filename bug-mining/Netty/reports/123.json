The code in question uses this comparator (io/netty/handler/codec/http/cookie/ClientCookieEncoder.java:91):\r\n\r\n```\r\n   /**\r\n     * Sort cookies into decreasing order of path length, breaking ties by sorting into increasing chronological\r\n     * order of creation time, as recommended by RFC 6265.\r\n     */\r\n    private static final Comparator<Cookie> COOKIE_COMPARATOR = (c1, c2) -> {\r\n        String path1 = c1.path();\r\n        String path2 = c2.path();\r\n        // Cookies with unspecified path default to the path of the request. We don't\r\n        // know the request path here, but we assume that the length of an unspecified\r\n        // path is longer than any specified path (i.e. pathless cookies come first),\r\n        // because setting cookies with a path longer than the request path is of\r\n        // limited use.\r\n        int len1 = path1 == null ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : path1.length();\r\n        int len2 = path2 == null ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : path2.length();\r\n        int diff = len2 - len1;\r\n        if (diff != 0) {\r\n            return diff;\r\n        }\r\n        // Rely on Java's sort stability to retain creation order in cases where\r\n        // cookies have same path length.\r\n        return -1;\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I pass two cookies C1 and C2 with the same path length to this function it would return C1 < C2 and C2 < C1. This - in my eyes  - is a violation of contract. And I suspect, this is causing the exception.\r\n\r\nReturning 0 instead of -1 should fix this.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCookies are always sorted by path\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nSorting cookies by path sometimes throws an exception\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nDifficult. Depends on the concrete cookies set, since TimSort contract violation detection is a byproduct which is triggered occasionally. TimSort does not actively looks for contract violations.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\nNot available\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.43.Final\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n\r\nopenjdk version \"11.0.4\" 2019-07-16\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.4+11-post-Ubuntu-1ubuntu218.04.3)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.4+11-post-Ubuntu-1ubuntu218.04.3, mixed mode, sharing)\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-62-generic x86_64)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9881/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
