first try to read private keys with BouncyCastle, and then fall back to our own code if that fails.\r\nIt could be the case, that BouncyCastle read some data before it failed, and in that case we need to make sure that our fallback code gets to read the key data from the original stream position - not whatever position caused a failure in BouncyCastle.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nUse the mark and reset methods of InputStream to reset the key stream position, if BouncyCastle cannot read a key.\r\nIf the provided input stream does not already support marking, then we wrap it in a BufferedInputStream which does.\r\nWe allow up to 1 MiB of data to be buffered for this purpose.\r\nIf the key is bigger than this, and BouncyCastle reads more than this before failing, then resetting will throw an exception so we don't get silent failures.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFixed private key fallback code path.\r\nFixes

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nTLS keys in the PKCS#1 format should be supported as well.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nit should be possible to use also PKCS#1 certificates.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nmost systems also allow generating PKCS#8 certificates or they can be manually converted.\r\nfor us it works to generate PKCS#8, however it's not the default of cert-manager.\r\n\r\nfor those using cert-manager, you can add the following to your `Certificate` k8s custom resource:\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1\r\nkind: Certificate\r\n# ...\r\nspec:\r\n# ...\r\n  privateKey:\r\n    encoding: PKCS8 # required by OpenSearch Security, it can't handle PKCS1 (which is the default of cert-manager)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n* PKCS#1 is the default for certificates generated by cert-manager, see the [`CertificatePrivateKey` specification](https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/api-docs/#cert-manager.io/v1.CertificatePrivateKey)\r\n* see also #52 (i decided to create a dedicated new ticket for this as it's not limited to Let's Encrypt and the other ticket seems to contain other topics as well)\r\n* e.g. Search Guard supports PKCS#1 as well.\r\n\r\nwhen starting OpenSearch Security 1.2.3.0 with PKCS#1 keys you get the following error in the log:\r\n```\r\n{\"type\": \"server\", \"timestamp\": \"2022-01-14T08:18:14,945Z\", \"level\": \"ERROR\", \"component\": \"o.o.s.s.DefaultSecurityKeyStore\", \"cluster.name\": \"test-opensearch\", \"node.name\": \"test-opensearch-0\", \"message\": \"Your keystore or PEM does not contain a key.
