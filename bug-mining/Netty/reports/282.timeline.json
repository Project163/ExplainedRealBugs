there,\r\nI have the same issue here. \r\n\r\nI did some research and found that this is probably not an Android issue.\r\nPemReader class uses regex to parse the certificates from the InputStream, but the thing is that regex works differently in JVM and Android Runtime.\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/285ba74f899866ddf3e23a6770c954e350245bd7/handler/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/ssl/PemReader.java#L84C1-L90C14\r\nPemReader expects that after matching the header the matcher moves the cursor to a position after the header and it works this way in JVM but it doesn't in Android and the certificate body is matched starting from the beginning of the string as just \"BEGIN\". And this is why the conversion to an X509 certificate instance fails.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by calling the find() method with the next position after the header as a parameter, or by using the BouncyCastle PEMParser as it's done for the private key.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1803965935/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fishb1","id":7566258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjYyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7566258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1","html_url":"https://github.com/fishb1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1803984290","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13515#issuecomment-1803984290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13515","id":1803984290,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c85rhp2i","user":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-09T14:54:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T14:54:20Z","body":"@fishb1

I expected that usePatten() method reset the latest match position but I read the doc for the method again and it said that the position should not be affected. \r\n\r\nThanks for submitting this! \r\n\r\nBut I think a fix needs to be done anyway to make Netty work in older SDKs, even if Google fixes the regex issue in future versions.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1804214410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fishb1","id":7566258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjYyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7566258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1","html_url":"https://github.com/fishb1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"fishb1","id":7566258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjYyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7566258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1","html_url":"https://github.com/fishb1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishb1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-10T09:05:57Z","updated_at":"2023-11-10T09:05:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13695","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13695/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13695/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13695/events","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13695","id":1987201785,"node_id":"PR_kwDOABA-c85fHlHS","number":13695,"title":"Workaround

Netty is started from an Android app and certificate/private key are passed into the builder as input streams, an error occurs: org.conscrypt.OpenSSLX509CertificateFactory: org.conscrypt.OpenSSLX509CertificateFactory: java.lang.RuntimeException: error:0c0000a2:ASN.1 encoding routines:OPENSSL_internal:NOT_ENOUGH_DATA\r\n\r\nDue to a bug in the regex implementation in Android SDK, the certificate is parsed from the input stream as BEGIN and further creating of the X.509 certificate fails.\r\n\r\nSee https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/293206296 \r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nThe end position of the latest match is saved into a variable and used as the start position for the next match as a workaround for the bug.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes
