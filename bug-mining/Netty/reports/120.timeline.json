https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8161\r\n- It will not allow cookies with the same name until Netty 5.\r\n  - https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7210\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- Add `Cookie`, which is an immutable representation of HTTP Cookie.\r\n- Add `CookieBuilder` which builds a `Cookie`.\r\n- Fork `{Client,Server}Cookie{Encoder,Decoder}` from Netty so it is\r\n  possible to encode and decode our `Cookie`.\r\n  - Modify `ServerCookieDecoder` to allow cookies with the same name.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n- Immutable HTTP cookie API\r\n- (Deprecation) `Cookies.copyOf()` has been deprecated in favor of `Cookies.of()`.\r\n- (Breaking) `Cookies` now use Armeria's own `Cookie`.\r\n- (Breaking?) `Cookies` may contain the cookies with the same name.\r\n  - RFC does not prohibit duplicate names at all, so this is a correct behavior.\r\n- (Breaking?) Annotated services now accept only the first `\"Cookie\"` header when decoding cookies in an `HttpRequest`. Sending multiple `\"Cookie\"` headers was a violation of RFC 6265 anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/line/armeria/issues/2286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/line/armeria/issues/2286/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2857036275,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4NTcwMzYyNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2857036275","actor":{"login":"trustin","id":173918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzkxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin","html_url":"https://github.com/trustin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b8b689f2487a8d53393819d7284d9c0a2f812b4f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/line/armeria/commits/b8b689f2487a8d53393819d7284d9c0a2f812b4f","created_at":"2019-12-05T09:11:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2863146392,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4NjMxNDYzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2863146392","actor":{"login":"carl-mastrangelo","id":8943572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NDM1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8943572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo","html_url":"https://github.com/carl-mastrangelo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e7cabfae8c058c119d9d24c902e91459fc2f5c7e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carl-mastrangelo/netty/commits/e7cabfae8c058c119d9d24c902e91459fc2f5c7e","created_at":"2019-12-07T00:48:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"carl-mastrangelo","id":8943572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NDM1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8943572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo","html_url":"https://github.com/carl-mastrangelo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carl-mastrangelo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-07T00:48:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-07T00:48:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9856","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9856/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9856/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9856/events","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9856","id":534324688,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzUwMjUzMjE5","number":9856,"title":"Add
