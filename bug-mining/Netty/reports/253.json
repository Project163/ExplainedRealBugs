This happens when auto-read is turned on when the queue is not empty. The reason is that _FlowControlHandler.read()_ does not pass the call to the _ChannelHandlerContext_ if at least one message has been dequeued. This is a problem when _FlowControlHandler.read()_ has been called as a result of auto-read having been turned on (_DefaultChannelConfig.setAutoRead()_ calling read() in case of _autoRead && !oldAutoRead_).\r\nTaking _ctx.read();_ out of the body of the if statement fixes the bug and I also did not notice any unwanted side effects. I.e.:\r\n```\r\npublic void read(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) throws Exception {\r\n    if (dequeue(ctx, 1) == 0) {\r\n        shouldConsume = true;\r\n    }\r\n    ctx.read();\r\n}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n### Expected behavior\r\nAuto-reading.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nReading the messages that are already in the queue and then no auto-reading.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nOn a channel with a FlowControlHandler in its pipeline, turn auto-read off while a message is in the process of being added to the handler's queue.  When the message is already in the queue, turn auto-read back on.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\nIt is a bit hard to reproduce with simple code so I hope that you understand the issue from my description.\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\nany\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\nany\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nany\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
