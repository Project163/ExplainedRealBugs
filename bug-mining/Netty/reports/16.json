Expected behavior\r\nJsonDecoder should keep reading bytes even if the call to discardSomeReadBytes() is made.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nJsonDecoder internal idx value is not reset, so the reader can no longer read bytes.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nSend lots of data to a connection with a JsonDecoder, when a call to discardSomeReadBytes() is made the readerIndex will be reset. The internal idx of the JsonDecoder won't be reset so the decoder won't be able to read anymore bytes.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\njava version \"1.8.0_102\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_102-b14)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.102-b14, mixed mode)\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nDarwin Andrews-MBP 16.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.0.0: Mon Aug 29 17:56:20 PDT 2016; root:xnu-3789.1.32~3/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6156/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
