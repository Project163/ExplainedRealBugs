#14507 (#14509)\r\n\r\nMotivations:\r\n\r\n* it's not the responsibility of MqttPublishMessage, which is a ByteBufHolder to ensure the accessibility of the ByteBuf. The ByteBuf checks it himself.\r\n* the current design is broken and there's no way to check if the content is accessible as refCnt crashes with\r\nIllegalReferenceCountException instead of returning 0.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nRemove ByteBufUtil.ensureAccessible from MqttPublishMessage#content. ByteBuf's methods will check themselves.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #14507\r\n\r\nIt's now possible to check if the payload of a MqttPublishMessage is accessible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15448394391,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c86goIfzzwAAAAOYy8qX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/15448394391","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2e4fbee92f465e96e5aff894e51b91135be174a2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/2e4fbee92f465e96e5aff894e51b91135be174a2","created_at":"2024-11-27T07:54:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
