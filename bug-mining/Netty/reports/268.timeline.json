The case where is breaks is for `32` which, correct me if I'm wrong, would not be skipped by that code? I think `32` is a whitespace in ASCII. \r\n\r\nIn my example `BDC Cook` the whitespace's value when reading `hex[start+i] ` is `32`.\r\n\r\nMaybe as some additional input:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbyte[] data = new byte[] {57, 32, 57}; // data like this ends up in the getChunkedSize method, can't tell why it ends up there\r\nSystem.out.println(new String(data)); // \"9 9\"\r\nSystem.out.println(Character.isWhitespace(data[1])); // true, this was used in the previous implementation of the getChunkedSize method\r\nSystem.out.println(StringUtil.decodeHexNibble(data[1])); // -1\r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1466538933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lars-n","id":5624567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n","html_url":"https://github.com/lars-n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars-n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8734241306,"node_id":"MEE_lADOABA-c85gqZFxzwAAAAIImfIa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/8734241306","actor":{"login":"franz1981","id":13125299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981","html_url":"https://github.com/franz1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-13T17:02:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8734241324,"node_id":"SE_lADOABA-c85gqZFxzwAAAAIImfIs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/8734241324","actor":{"login":"franz1981","id":13125299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981","html_url":"https://github.com/franz1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-13T17:02:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1466605431","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13273#issuecomment-1466605431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13273","id":1466605431,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c85Xap93","user":{"login":"franz1981","id":13125299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981","html_url":"https://github.com/franz1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-13T17:38:31Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T17:38:31Z","body":"Yeah,
