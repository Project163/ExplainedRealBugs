way BoringSSL-related TLS 1.3 certificates are regisgtered and\r\nthen converted to their java equivalent name, will cause a null\r\nvalue to be added to the set of OpenSsl.availableJavaCipherSuites.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\nWhile the underlying root cause (the differently named ciphers) is not resolved with this changeset, the code now makes sure that if a conversion has not been successful (and returning null as a result), it is not added to the list of available cipher suites and therefore acts as a safeguard to the caller.\r\n\r\nA related, outdated javadoc has been fixed as well and regression tests added.\r\n\r\nFixes
