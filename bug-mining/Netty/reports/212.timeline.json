the heap _in general_, the free memory on the heap is not the same as the amount of memory that could be freed if the GC was to do a run, so we can only realistically do this for direct memory where we have precise accounting of what memory is in use and what is not. But then there's also fragmentation; having X free bytes doesn't necessarily mean there's room for an X-sized allocation.\r\n\r\nBut to count the free bytes, you can iterate the arenas (`pool.arenaMetrics()`), and then iterate the chunk lists for each (`arena.chunkLists`) and then for each chunk in those you can get the `freeBytes()`.

Motivation\r\nOur server has its own implementation to decide whether to provide service for users according to the real-time estimated total free memory of the heap memory and the direct memory (mainly the memory used by `io.netty.buffer.PooledByteBufAllocator` for our server). If our server detects it's running out of physical memory, it will just respond with the client requests with something like `Service Unavailable`.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is: We cannot know the used memory of PooledByteBufAllocator efficiently. For example, we have allocated and cached 8GB chunks in a `PooledByteBufAllocator`, but there is no property to know: From the user perspective, what exactly the used memory is, 1GB or 8GB?\r\n\r\nThe PR will provide `usedDirectBytes` and `usedHeapBytes` for these purposes.\r\n\r\n## Modification\r\n(Honestly, I didn't come up with better names to distinguish the existing `usedDirectMemory` and the new `usedDirectBytes`. If Netty were a new project, we can distinguish these memories by calling the existing `usedDirectMemory` `committedDirectMemory` and the new memory metric `usedDirectMemory`, but Netty has been widely used in the Java world so I don't call them in this way)\r\n\r\nWhen a pooled buffer is allocated/deallocated, grows, and shrinks, count the increase/decrease size to count `usedDirectBytes`

\"used memory\" is the amount of memory that a pooled allocator has currently allocated and committed for itself.\r\nThs is useful for managing resource usage of the pool versus the available system resources.\r\nHowever, it is not useful for managing resources of the currently circulating buffer instances versus the pool.\r\nThe pinned memory is the memory currently in use by buffers in circulation, plus memory held in the thread-local caches.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nAdd pinned memory accounting to PoolChunk.\r\nWe cannot just use the existing freeBytes because that field is only updated when pool subpages are retired, and a chunk will never retire its last subpage instance.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nIt is now possible to get a fairly accurate (with slight over-counting due to the thread-local caches) picture of how much memory is held up in buffer instances at any given moment.\r\n\r\nFixes
