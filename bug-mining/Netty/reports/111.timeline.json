@nicmunroe Hi guys , ```Content-Type = media-type``` follows from RFC:\r\n```media-type = type \"/\" subtype *( OWS \";\" OWS parameter )```\r\n        ```type  = token```\r\n       ``` subtype  = token```\r\nI think starting content-type value with ';' is not correct, and we should handle this like \"unsupported media type\".\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/438982395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amizurov","id":8257855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTc4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8257855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov","html_url":"https://github.com/amizurov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amizurov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1968158394,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk2ODE1ODM5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1968158394","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-15T09:52:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1968158396,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5NjgxNTgzOTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1968158396","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-15T09:52:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1968158399,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk2ODE1ODM5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1968158399","actor":{"login":"nicmunroe","id":15578205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTc4MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15578205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe","html_url":"https://github.com/nicmunroe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-15T09:52:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1968158400,"node_id":"MDE1OlN

relevant RFC sections (I'm assuming you're referring to RFC 7231 [Section 3.1.1.5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5) and [Section 3.1.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.1)) don't specify that you must respond with an error when encountering invalid content-type. In fact when talking about Content-Type in section 3.1.1.5 it says:\r\n\r\n> In practice, resource owners do not always properly configure their origin server to provide the correct Content-Type for a given representation, with the result that some clients will examine a payload's content and override the specified type.\r\n\r\nIt goes on to say this is might be a bad idea and `Implementers are encouraged to provide a means of disabling such \"content sniffing\" when it is used`, but the point is that the RFC seems to be indicating that it should be expected for Content-Type to sometimes be bad/broken/incorrect.\r\n\r\nSo I think we could choose to gracefully handle badly-formatted Content-Type here without throwing an error, and it wouldn't go against the RFC (and might even be more in line with the RFC, depending on how you read it).\r\n\r\nFrom a non-RFC perspective it feels weird to me to throw an exception of any sort when calling `HttpPostRequestDecoder.isMultipart(HttpRequest)` (i.e. a malformed content-type header is clearly not multipart - so the method should just return false), and I'm not sure the `splitHeaderContentType(...)` method would be the right place to throw it even if we decided throwing an exception was warranted.\r\n\r\n(Unless throwing an exception is not what you meant by \"handle this like unsupported media type\"? If so I'd need more info on what you meant.)\r\n\r\nUltimately my gut instinct is that this doesn't feel like a fail-fast situation.

And I think when we expect the concrete ``media-type``: (application/json, multipart/form-data ... etc) we should handle request like a ```400 Bad Request``` and responding to client with reason: \"unsupported media type\" for example. \r\n\r\nThis is make sense to the client side to knowns what happens and fix issue also we prevent problems on server.  But how you said - it's depending how we read RFC and what we wont to fix only one method or situation in common
