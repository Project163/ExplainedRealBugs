But this makes no sense, as the results of a CNAME query are only going to refer to A/AAAA records. There is no way for a CNAME to refer to an SRV record or other record types.\r\n\r\nThe fallback to CNAME should only happen if the requested record type is A or AAAA.\r\n \r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nLookup an SRV record that doesn't exist, and observe in logs or packet capture that a CNAME query is also performed.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/benevans/910e5dd451899135267d21420b72e4dd\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.63.Final\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n\r\n   openjdk version \"11.0.9.1\" 2020-11-04\r\n   OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1)\r\n   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1, mixed mode)\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\n\r\n   Linux orogene 4.15.0-142-generic #146-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 13 01:11:19 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
