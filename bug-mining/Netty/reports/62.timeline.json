Those problems include killing connections in production (relatively infrequent, but happens enough to be noticed) and some failing tests. We can work around it by validating headers before they are sent to the peer or disabling validation but ideally the receiving end, which should do this validation regardless to adhere to the spec, only needs to do it and behave correctly.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/399227332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bryce-anderson","id":2948506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2948506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson","html_url":"https://github.com/bryce-anderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/399227632","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8043#issuecomment-399227632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8043","id":399227632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTIyNzYzMg==","user":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T20:11:35Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T20:11:35Z","body":"@Scottmitch

that's my interpretation of http2 spec section [8.1.2.6](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#rfc.section.8.1.2.6):\r\n> Malformed requests or responses that are detected MUST be treated as a stream error (Section 5.4.2) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.\r\n\r\nI think you noted in your review of the patch that introduced validation that tearing down the connection is pretty heavy handed.
