isn't a `ReferencedCounted` object. \r\nA component consuming an `HAProxyMessage` object and not passing it further might not release it, while it should be released as it contains a list of TLVs created in the static function `readNextTLV`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/00afb19d7a37de21b35ce4f6cb3fa7f74809f2ab/codec-haproxy/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/haproxy/HAProxyMessage.java#L235-L241\r\n\r\nNotice that this function retains a slice of the original header ByteBuf increasing its refCnt and causing a possible memory leak if one forgets to release them explicitly:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/00afb19d7a37de21b35ce4f6cb3fa7f74809f2ab/codec-haproxy/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/haproxy/HAProxyMessage.java#L296\r\n\r\nI would expect `HAProxyMessage` to implement `ReferencedCounted` and release the TLVs in a similar fashion to: `haProxyMessage.tlvs().forEach(tlv -> tlv.release());` \r\n\r\nWe have found this issue only after we had leaks.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it seems that slices are purposely retained as seen in Netty tests, am I missing something?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/00afb19d7a37de21b35ce4f6cb3fa7f74809f2ab/codec-haproxy/src/test/java/io/netty/handler/codec/haproxy/HAProxyMessageDecoderTest.java#L642-L650\r\n\r\n###
