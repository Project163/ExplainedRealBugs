\r\nDuring our testing phase, I encountered a challenge with the SslHandshakeTimeoutException as its constructor was protected, making it inaccessible for direct instantiation within our test suite. This limitation prevented thorough testing of scenarios involving SSL handshake timeouts. To address this, I've made the constructor public, allowing us to create SslHandshakeTimeoutException instances within our tests effectively. \r\n\r\nModification: \r\nRecognizing the need for comprehensive test coverage, I've made the constructor public for creating instances of SslHandshakeTimeoutException within our test module. This modification enables us to properly simulate and test scenarios related to SSL handshake timeouts, thereby enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of our test suite. \r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFixes #13926.\r\n\r\nThis pull request resolves the challenge of inaccessible constructors for SslHandshakeTimeoutException.s. With this enhancement, we can now thoroughly test and validate scenarios involving SSL handshake timeouts, ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of our tests.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13929/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/2018533900","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13926#issuecomment-2018533900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13926","id":2018533900,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c854UGIM","user":{"login":"satpal-07","id":6899271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTkyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6899271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07","html_url":"https://github.com/satpal-07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satpal-07/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-25T17:30:22Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T17:30:22Z","body":"I
