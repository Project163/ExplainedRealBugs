Recycler uses thread-local caches, and if objects are shared across threads, they will return to the thread-local pool they were allocated from.\r\nHowever, if that thread has terminated, then it will have no use for any returning objects and the return process can be skipped.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nIn the associated `onRemoval` for the thread-local, mark the local pool as dead, by setting the `pooledHandles` reference to `null`.\r\nReturning objects to their original pools is then guarded by a null-check.\r\nTo make this thread-safe, the `pooledHandles` reference changes from `final` to `volatile`.\r\nWith a newer JVM baseline, we could have made the field plain, and null it out with an opaque store, because the `handle.toAvailable()` call otherwise gives us the compiler barriers we need to make our null-check thread-safe.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nRecycler-able objects can be garbage collected sooner after the termination of the allocating thread.\r\n\r\nFixes
