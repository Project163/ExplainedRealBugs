seems Netty's native support depends on glibc (btw is this documented?).\r\nWhen glibc is missing (for example using vanilla Alpine), the JVM could end up with a crash (`SIGSEGV`), see details in this issue: https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/2776\r\n\r\nIt also seems that `Epoll.isAvailable()` returns `true` even if glibc is missing.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThrowing an exception\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nJVM crash\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nUsing Netty native with an environment that does not have glibc, e.g.: vanilla Alpine\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\nThis seems to be a known issue, please let me know if you really need a reproducer.\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n`4.1.68` (latest)\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\nLatest 11:\r\n```bash\r\n ❯ docker run --rm 'azul/zulu-openjdk-alpine:11-jre' 'sh' '-c' 'java --version'\r\nopenjdk 11.0.12 2021-07-20 LTS\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.50+19-CA (build 11.0.12+7-LTS)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.50+19-CA (build 11.0.12+7-LTS, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\nOr also latest 17:\r\n```bash\r\n ❯ docker run --rm 'bellsoft/liberica-openjdk-alpine-musl:17' 'sh' '-c' 'java --version'\r\nopenjdk 17 2021-09-14 LTS\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17+35-LTS)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17+35-LTS, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\nI assume this is an issue in every JRE that is currently supported.\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nBoth images above have the same output:\r\n```bash\r\n ❯ docker run --rm 'azul/zulu-openjdk-alpine:11-jre' 'sh' '-c' 'uname -a'\r\nLinux 1ee8d1090f14 5.10.47-linuxkit #1 SMP Sat Jul 3 21:51:47 UTC 2021 x86_64 Linux\r\n```\r\nI assume this is an issue in every OS where glibc is missing.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11701/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
