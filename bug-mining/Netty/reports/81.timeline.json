6455 defines that, generally, a WebSocket client should not close a TCP\r\nconnection as far as a server is the one who's responsible for doing that.\r\nIn practice tho', it's not always possible to control the server. Server's\r\nmisbehavior may lead to connections being leaked (if the server does not\r\ncomply with the RFC).\r\n\r\nRFC 6455 #7.1.1 says\r\n\r\n> In abnormal cases (such as not having received a TCP Close from the server\r\nafter a reasonable amount of time) a client MAY initiate the TCP Close.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n* WebSocket client handshaker additional param `forceCloseAfterMillis`\r\n\r\n* Switched off by default to keep backward compatibility\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nWebSocket client handshaker to comply with RFC. Fixes #8883.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOpen questions/comments:\r\n\r\n* I've implemented this as a `WebSocketClientHandshaker` functionality, not in handlers, as far as it's responsible for `close`.\r\n\r\n* Nothing prevents you to call `handshaker.close` twice, in such a case only first timeout would be applied.\r\n\r\n* Do we need to keep this feature switched OFF by default to ensure backward compatibility? I mean... it's hard to justify current implementation and I think 10 seconds default timeout should be enough to cover potential drawbacks. @normanmaurer WDYT?\r\n\r\n* Testing is kind of clumsy... It's impossible to detect if the channel was closed because of timeout or because of the server or... whatever. Maybe I'm missing any better approach to test this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2171018120,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNzEwMTgxMjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2171018120","actor":{"login":"kachayev","id":485647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTY0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/485647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev","html_url":"https://github.com/kachayev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"326620a3adfc5cebfa9409058cba5fc3a5ca9e3b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kachayev/netty/commits/326620a3adfc5cebfa9409058cba5fc3a5ca9e3b","created_at":"2019-02-28T13:18:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2171025160,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNzEwMjUxNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2171025160","actor":{"login":"kachayev","id":485647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTY0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/485647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev","html_url":"https://github.com/kachayev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1e91a34a069a8f9782629edfa8c5b5c636a98fec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kachayev/netty/commits/1e91a34a069a8f9782629edfa8c5b5c636a98fec","created_at":"2019-02-28T13:21:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2171169651,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNzExNjk2NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2171169651","actor":{"login":"kachayev","id":485647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTY0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/485647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev","html_url":"https://github.com/kachayev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c150a748d9717f4c9dff5a5a82602d9631ff4746","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kachayev/netty/commits/c150a748d9717f4c9dff5a5a82602d9631ff4746","created_at":"2019-02-28T14:14:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2172194168,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNzIxOTQxNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2172194168","actor":{"login":"kachayev","id":485647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTY0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/485647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev","html_url":"https://github.com/kachayev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kach
