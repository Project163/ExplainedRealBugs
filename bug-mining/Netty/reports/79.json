Create an client that slowly downloads the content from the server. Watch the `IdleStateHandler` trigger before the download is complete.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/magnus-gustafsson/c009c04aedf14a8b426dcb48450cc7d4\r\nWhen this sample is run with the `IdleStateHandler` in the pipeline we get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMon Mar 04 09:02:28 CET 2019: Server - listening on: http://localhost:8082/\r\nMon Mar 04 09:02:28 CET 2019: Client - connecting\r\nMon Mar 04 09:02:28 CET 2019: Server - Received request, writing response with size 67108864 on : [id: 0xb4450a55, L:/127.0.0.1:8082 - R:/127.0.0.1:38182]\r\nMon Mar 04 09:02:38 CET 2019: Server - Channel is idle, closing it: [id: 0xb4450a55, L:/127.0.0.1:8082 - R:/127.0.0.1:38182], ALL_IDLE\r\nMon Mar 04 09:02:38 CET 2019: Server - : Write complete.
