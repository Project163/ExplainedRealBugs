is possible for two separate threads to race on recycling an object.\r\nIf this happens, the object might be added to a WeakOrderQueue when it shouldn't be.\r\nThe end result of this is that an object could be acquired multiple times, without a recycle in between.\r\nEffectively, it ends up in circulation twice.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nWe fix this by making the update to the lastRecycledId field of the handle, an atomic state transition.\r\nOnly the thread that \"wins\" the race and succeeds in their state transition will be allowed to recycle the object.\r\nThe others will bail out on their recycling.\r\nWe use weakCompareAndSet because we only need the atomicity guarantee, and the program order within each thread is sufficient.\r\nAlso, spurious failures just means we won't recycle that particular object, which is fine.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nObjects no longer risk circulating twice due to a recycle race.\r\n\r\nThis fixes
