assessment seems correct to me. It has been a while but I think the though process at the time was \"we aren't sure if the user will need to care about ping (or ping ack) yet so lets drop it\". However we retain the `ByteBuf` so that approach is inconsistent. My vote would be to propagate this through the parent channel's pipeline (as a channel read) so the user has visibility into it (instead of just releasing it as suggested in your unit test above). If the user doesn't handle it then it will automatically be released at the tail of the pipeline and a message will be logged (just like usual). @ejona86 @normanmaurer @carl-mastrangelo -

seems there's a general problem with Http2MultiplexCodec: it should either release or propagate unknown types. That's what #7612 does. So I'm good with that PR.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think we actually want to propagate PINGs, or at least in that way.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest two options:\r\n1. Don't propagate inbound PINGs. Instead, let an outbound PING have a Future that will be completed when the PING ACK arrives. The payload of PING wouldn't be exposed at all. (If we separated Http2MultiplexCodec from Http2FrameCodec we could propagate the PING within that small area, but that doesn't exist today. This is why PING existed during my earlier h2childchan PRs.)\r\n2. Use a userEvent. I don't like propagating the read because the logging isn't really acceptable. As a user you're forced to handle it. Yes, it will be \"handled\" without you doing anything, but the logging just tells you \"you're doing it wrong.\" That's the approach I was taking for the child chan itself; everything optional is a user event or has a trigger to enable.\r\n\r\nFor (2), if we're going to expose the payload, let's use a simple long or byte[] instead of ByteBuf. The size of the payload is fixed and really small. There's really no gain by using ByteBuf and the refcounting complicates things. This is the same approach I want to make for Http2GoAwayFrame.

The payload is frequently an ID to keep easier track of what the ACKs mean. Coordinating the allocation is a bit of a problem since there are multiple handlers (including the HTTP/2 code itself) that may need to send them.

The ByteBuf pointer chasing and vtable indirection will be much more costly than that. And a pointer is 8 bytes, so we're _already_ copying the equivalent amount of data. And a pointer assignment is also more expensive in Java to coordinate with the GC. The ByteBuf will also need read and write indexes and a capacity and ref counting and...\r\n\r\nThe copying could be a bigger concern for GOAWAY, but the messages tend to be short. (I've not seen one larger than, say, 16 bytes?) But the GOAWAY case is also the one that benefits the most, in that [we're duplicating a DefaultHttp2GoAwayFrame and a ByteBuf for each child channel](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/911b2ac/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/Http2MultiplexCodec.java#L326). That's (8+4+4)+(8+4+4+4+4+4) = 44 bytes (assuming a DuplicatedByteBuf). If we used a byte[], we could actually share the same DefaultHttp2GoAwayFrame across all child channels, because there's no longer the readerIndex.\r\n\r\nTo me, the argument for keeping it as a ByteBuf is that it is convenient, because people are familiar with working with them.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/360316736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/360354379","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7607#issuecomment-360354379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/7607","id":360354379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDM1NDM3OQ==","user":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjI4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T04:00:25Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T04:00:25Z","body":"Agreed `ByteBuf` currently has a high constant overhead and is bloated for small payloads (which is exacerbated by duplication/wrapping).
