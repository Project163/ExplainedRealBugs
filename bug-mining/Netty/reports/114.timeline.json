should respect JVM flags to control SSL protocols, eg. `-Djdk.tls.client.protocols`\r\n\r\n\r\nModification: \r\n\r\nChanged `JdkSslContext` to use `SSLContext.getDefaultSSLParameters().getProtocols()` instead of `engine.getSupportedProtocols()` which is hardcoded as `SSLv2Hello, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2`.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nWithout `-Djdk.tls.client.protocols`, `SSLContext.getDefaultSSLParameters().getProtocols()` returns `TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2`.\r\n\r\nWith `-Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.2`, `SSLContext.getDefaultSSLParameters().getProtocols()` returns `TLSv1.2`.\r\n\r\nFixes #9706
