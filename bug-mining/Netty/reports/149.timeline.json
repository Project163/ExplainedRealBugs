native images built with native-image tool do not support Unsafe.staticFieldOffset() method (at least, currently). If an application using Netty (and causing initialization of io.netty.util.internal.PlatformDependent0 class) is built into a native image and run, this results in the following error thrown during initialization:\r\n\r\nException in thread \"main\" com.oracle.svm.core.jdk.UnsupportedFeatureError: Unsupported method of Unsafe\r\n\tat com.oracle.svm.core.util.VMError.unsupportedFeature(VMError.java:86)\r\n\tat jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.staticFieldOffset(Unsafe.java:230)\r\n\tat sun.misc.Unsafe.staticFieldOffset(Unsafe.java:662)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.internal.PlatformDependent0$5.run(PlatformDependent0.java:294)\r\n\tat java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(AccessController.java:83)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.internal.PlatformDependent0.<clinit>(PlatformDependent0.java:279)\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the reason of the behavior described in #10051.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nThe idea of this commit is to only invoke Unsafe.staticFieldOffset() is we are not in a native image; if we are, behave like if we could not find the field at all.\r\n\r\nGraalDetector is borrowed from Spring framework.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #10051\r\n\r\nThe resulting code works successfully in a native image (at least, on x86_64).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/664027869","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/10051#issuecomment-664027869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10051","id":664027869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDAyNzg2OQ==","user":{"login":"rpuch","id":3244433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQ0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3244433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch","html_url":"https://github.com/rpuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-26T19:06:26Z","updated_at":"2020-07-26T19:07:16Z","body":"As a work-around: `-Dio.netty.noUnsafe=true` added at run time (that is, if your built application is called `app`, it is `./app -Dio.netty.noUnsafe=true`) seems to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nPlease note that it compleletely disables the usage of `Unsafe` by Netty.
