I'm also running into this issue. I'm not sure I fully understand why this `NoSuchMethodException` is being thrown and why it's fine to ignore it. In a vert.x based application I compiled with graalvm native, I'm getting hundreds of these reflective errors when starting up because I have the `io.netty` level set to `FINE`.\r\n\r\nAre these errors expected? I'm using `4.1.49` so the netty version I'm using includes this fix.
