From looking at the code, the parent buffer must be selected for leak tracking _and_ the derived buffer must also be selected by a separate roll of the dice.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a headache for me. I'm trying to debug a leak in an application where buffers are derived several times:\r\n\r\n- Bytes are pulled off the wire. This level 1 buffer has, by default, 1 in 128 chance to be selected for leak tracking.\r\n- The level 1 buffer is sliced, creating a level 2 buffer. This buffer has, by default, 1 in 16,384 chance to be selected for leak tracking.\r\n- The level 2 buffer is sliced again, creating a level 3 buffer. This buffer has, by default, 1 in 2,097,152 chance to be selected for leak tracking. You have a better chance of winning $50,000 playing PowerBall.\r\n- The level 3 buffer might be duplicated, creating a level 4 buffer. This buffer has, by default, 1 in 268,435,456 chance to be selected for leak tracking. Your odds of winning the PowerBall grand prize are only mildly worse.\r\n\r\nI get some leak logging for the level 1 buffers, and a handful of level 2. Based on those, it looks like the actual problem is that level 3/4 buffers are not being released properly. But since I have zero logs for those due to how unlikely they are to be selected for tracking, I can't tell where the the problem is.\r\n\r\nI'm now trying to work around this by setting `io.netty.leakDetection.samplingInterval` to 32 and hoping I get lucky. Obviously, I could switch to PARANOID level, but this is happening in a production environment and I haven't been able to reproduce it elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIMO, Netty should provide a better solution for this situation. Two ideas off the top of my head:\r\n\r\n- If the non-derived (level 1) buffer is selected for leak tracking, all derived buffers are automatically selected as well. No rolling dice.\r\n- Make it possible for derived buffers to be selected for leak tracking even if the parent buffer was not.\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.92.Final\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
