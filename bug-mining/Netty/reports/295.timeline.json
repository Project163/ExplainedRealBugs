deploying Netty on a read-only volume (e.g, within a Docker container) with \"zstd-jni\" included in the classpath, initialization of zstd will fail because it requires unpacking files into a temporary directory. Therefore, it is crucial to verify whether zstd can be initialized, rather than merely checking for the presence of the library in the classpath.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nDuring the verification process for the presence of \"zstd-jni\" in the classpath, the system will also attempt to initialize the library. This initialization follows a pattern similar to that used for the Brotli library check.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #13978.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12518557608,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA-c86FsRN2zwAAAALqKgeo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/12518557608","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-18T06:54:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12518557672,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c86FsRN2zwAAAALqKgfo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/12518557672","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5834cdb9766f9a8935f23fbbadcd029d3b815820","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/5834cdb9766f9a8935f23fbbadcd029d3b815820","created_at":"2024-04-18T06:54:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12518569586,"node_id":"MIE_lADOABA-c86FsRN2zwAAAALqKjZy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/12518569586","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-18T06:55:52Z","milestone":{"title":"4.1.110.Final"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12518598463,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c86FsRN2zwAAAALqKqc_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/12518598463","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url"
