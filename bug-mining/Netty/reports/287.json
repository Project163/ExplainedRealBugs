Expected behavior\r\nI expect the Snappy compressor to be able to compress a much larger amount than 32767 bytes.\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nAn exception is thrown if the data is too large.\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nTry to compress a ByteBuf larger than 32767 bytes using the Snappy.encode method.\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n```java\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    final byte[] random = new byte[40_000];\r\n    ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextBytes(random);\r\n    { // This should work\r\n        final Snappy snappy = new Snappy();\r\n        final ByteBuf data = Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(Arrays.copyOfRange(random, 0, 32767));\r\n        final ByteBuf out = Unpooled.buffer();\r\n        snappy.encode(data, out, data.readableBytes());\r\n    }\r\n    { // This does not work\r\n        final Snappy snappy = new Snappy();\r\n        final ByteBuf data = Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(random);\r\n        final ByteBuf out = Unpooled.buffer();\r\n        snappy.encode(data, out, data.readableBytes());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1.89\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\njava version
