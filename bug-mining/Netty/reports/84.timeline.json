need to be removed before adding it to the Netty codebase (e.g. with classname `io.netty.native.Feature`).

native images are a new way to deliver java applications. Netty is one of the most popular libraries however there are a few limitations that make it impossible to use with native images out of the box. Adding a few metadata (in specific modules will allow the compilation to success and produce working binaries)\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nAdded properties files in `META-INF` and substitutions classes (under `internal.svm`) will solve the compilation issues. The substitutions classes are not visible and do not have a public constructor so they are not visible to end users.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #8959 \r\n\r\nThis fix is very conservative as it applies the minimum config required to build:\r\n\r\n* pure netty servers\r\n* vert.x applications\r\n* grpc applications\r\n\r\nThe build is having trouble due to checkstyle which does not seem to be able to find the copyright notice on property files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8963/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/481178513","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8959#issuecomment-481178513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8959","id":481178513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTE3ODUxMw==","user":{"login":"sdeleuze","id":141109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze","html_url":"https://github.com/sdeleuze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T09:37:04Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T09:37:04Z","body":"Thanks for contributing the PR @pmlopes!
