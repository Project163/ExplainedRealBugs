for most of REST application, where a single request through uri parameter is not enough, a body is mandatory. It is not refused, contrary to HEAD, as noticed: \"might cause some existing implementations to reject the request\". \r\n\r\nIt is not standard and not fully supported, I agree, but even the RFC said that it could be useful. And as I note (my current project use this), in REST interface, GET or DELETE could use it. Of course, it is not mandatory, but preventing it might lead to implement this without Netty.\r\n\r\nSo yes, we might write a disclaimer, letting the final implementation (business code) to implement or not those methods with body. I'm recalling the old proposal (closed 6 month ago now since no activity on it) about adding support for REST support natively in Netty. It might be one way to allow/disallow by knowing it those extra support. One way to do it could be to have as in Apache Http Client / Jersey a special configuration that said \"Allow Non official\" (ClientProperties.SUPPRESS_HTTP_COMPLIANCE_VALIDATION).\r\n\r\nWDYT?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/268486227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fredericBregier","id":477131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzEzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/477131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier","html_url":"https://github.com/fredericBregier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredericBregier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":901381376,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTAxMzgxMzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/901381376","actor":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjI4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-21T10:16:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":901381377,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkwMTM4MTM3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/901381377","actor":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjI4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-21T10:16:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/268489390","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6138#issuecomment-268489390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6138","id":268489390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODQ4OTM5MA==","user":{"login":"slandelle","id":849197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/849197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle","html_url":"https://github.com/slandelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slandelle/received_events",

for 100% sure, reading the RFC 7231, it seems only the following is not allowed to have a body:\r\n\r\n- TRACE : \"A client MUST NOT send a message body in a TRACE request.\" (4.3.8)\r\n\r\nwhile others are either explicitely allowed:\r\n- POST\r\n- PUT\r\n- OPTIONS\r\n\r\nOr with the following warning: where you can replace XXX by GET, HEAD, DELETE, CONNECT\r\n\"A payload within a XXX request message has no defined semantics;\r\n   sending a payload body on a XXX request might cause some existing\r\n   implementations to reject the request.\"\r\n\r\nI was wrong saying that HEAD is not allowed (probably too fast reading).\r\n\r\nSo I'm proposing to allow all except TRACE, and adding a special warning in the Decoder class with reference to the sentence of the RFC above.

Netty, currently, the HttpPostRequestEncoder only supports POST, PUT, PATCH and OPTIONS, while the RFC 7231 allows with a warning that GET, HEAD, DELETE and CONNECT use a body too (but not TRACE where it is explicitely not allowed).\r\nThe RFC in chapter 4.3 says:\r\n\"A payload within a XXX request message has no defined semantics;\r\nsending a payload body on a XXX request might cause some existing\r\nimplementations to reject the request.\"\r\nwhere XXX can be replaced by one of GET, HEAD, DELETE or CONNECT.\r\n\r\nCurrent usages, on particular in REST mode, tend to use those extra HttpMethods for such queries.\r\n\r\nSo this PR proposes to remove the current restrictions, leaving only TRACE as explicitely not supported.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nIn the constructor, where the test is done, replacing all by checking only against TRACE, and adding one test to check that all methods are supported or not.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes
