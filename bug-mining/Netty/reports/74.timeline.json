 @nicktrav apologies for introducing this, but I'd like to highlight that there was some inconsistency beforehand; the other public constructors of `CompositeByteBuf` enforced `maxNumComponents >= 2` whereas this one  actually allowed any value including 0 or < 0 which obviously make no sense. I'm trying to think of any practical situation where the == 1 case might make sense.\r\n\r\nSo do we revert back to this inconsistent state or allow == 1 in all the constructors? Presumably we should at least now fail for <=

versions of Netty prior to 4.1.31.Final, a CompositeByteBuf could be\r\ncreated with any size (including potentially nonsensical negative\r\nvalues). This behavior changed in e7737b993, which introduced a bounds\r\ncheck to only allow for a component size greater than one. This broke\r\nsome existing use cases that attempted to create a byte buf with a\r\nsingle component.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nLower the bounds check on numComponents to include the single component\r\ncase, but still throw an exception for anything less than one.\r\n\r\nAdd unit tests for the case of numComponents being less than, equal to,\r\nand greater than this lower bound.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nReturn to the behavior of 4.1.30.Final, allowing one component, but\r\nstill include an explicit check against a lower bound.\r\n\r\nNote that while creating a CompositeByteBuf with a single component is\r\nin some ways a contradiction of the term \"composite\", this patch caters\r\nfor existing uses while excluding the clearly nonsensical case of asking\r\nfor a CompositeByteBuf with zero or fewer components.\r\n\r\nFixes
