is possible to create streams in the half-closed state where the\r\nstream state doesn't reflect that the request headers have been sent by\r\nthe client or the server hasn't received the request headers. This\r\nstate isn't possible in the H2 spec as a half closed stream must have\r\neither received a full request or have received the headers from a\r\npushed stream. In the current implementation, this can cause the stream\r\ncreated as part of an h2c upgrade request to be in this invalid state\r\nand result in the omission of RST frames as the client doesn't believe\r\nit has sent the request to begin with.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nThe `DefaultHttp2Connection.activate` method checks the state and\r\nmodifies the status of the request headers as appropriate.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes
