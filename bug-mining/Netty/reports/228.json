At times I would have liked to talk to someone about design choices and general questions about the library, but I wasn't able to find a place where Netty users come together (e.g. an IRC channel, a Discord server, etc). Netty's website brought me to StackOverflow, but my impression was that most questions go unanswered. The website's link to IRC is broken, and when I checked out #netty on liberachat I only saw 3 users in the channel. This leaves me wondering: where does the Netty community hang around? It would be helpful to clarify this somewhere visible, because right now the first impression is that the project is not as active as it used to be.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in case you are curious, I implemented a MySQL proxy from scratch (i.e. it receives MySQL connections and forwards them to arbitrary backends). I have the feeling that the library has helped me follow good design practices and that it has provided me a solid foundation to build upon, so thanks for that 😉 !","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
