would like to propose now fully removing support for Log4j v1 entirely, and not even have a `log4j-1.2-api` dependency.\r\n\r\nHaving found past discussions about this in related previous #11263 #11264 #11265, and accepting that this PR may get rejected if you consider that matter settled for good, I would like to make an attempt and retry to convince you otherwise anyway, with a new rationale:\r\n\r\nAs I've attempted to clarify through https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/629/files, I would argue that https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html is primarly useful and intended for \"applications\". I'm not so sure all this added extra complexity and delegation and layering is really in any of our interest for \"libraries\" (frameworks), such as Netty. The only reason this a library/framework project would want to do this is that you wish allow an application using Netty to keep Log4j v1 as their main logging framework. Except with `log4j-1.2-api` you anyway aren't really - because such applications have to change their configuration files from Log2j v1 to v2 format! I do understand that one COULD use Netty in an application and not use this `log4j-1.2-api` bridge to Log4j v2 but add a depenency to the old Log4j v1 Core (not Bridge). That would technically works, sure, but this enables the use of a version of a logging library that [has been officially unmainainted for many years](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache_logging_services_project_announces), which [is partially broken on Java 9+](https://blogs.apache.org/logging/entry/moving_on_to_log4j_2), and which has [at least one known security vulnernability which will never be patched](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-LOG4J-2316893). Perhaps some would say \"But this is not the concern of libarires/frameworks!\" I personally may even agreed until a few days ago... 😈 But given the fun we've all had over the last few days, I posit that \"eternal API backwards compatibility\" is overrated for something like this, and what's why I'm (re)proposing to fully remove support for Log4j v1 entirely, and not even have a `log4j-1.2-api` dependency in Netty anymore. It's simpler, clearer, more secure. The only drawback is for anyone insisting on using Netty an unmaintained version v1 of the Log4j logging library. It seems to me that an actively maintained project has no reason to offer that kind of backwards compability guarantee.\r\n\r\nThis PR will fail to build as-is initally submitted, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to correctly configure the `revapi-maven-plugin` (https://revapi.org) to accept the removal of `Log4JLoggerFactory` and `Log4JLogger` (which are in `.internal.` packages anyway - don't you want to ignore all changes to those anyway?) - I've tried a bunch of things, and somehow none of them worked; if this PR is acceptable in principle, I'm sure someone could figure that detail out.\r\n\r\n@normanmaurer @Stwissel @chrisvest\r\n\r\nSorry if this was long, and TX for reading.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11925/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11925/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5770391201,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c841RZS3zwAAAAFX8S6h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/5770391201","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"da1fdb56474a412a2ebe02cf57e51d6c2185b9e1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/da1fdb56474a412a2ebe02cf57e51d6c2185b9e1","created_at":"2021-12-15T10:40:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6956556247,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c841RZS3zwAAAAGepJ_X","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/6956556247","actor":{"login":"raidyue","id":2962896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI4OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2962896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue","html_url":"https://github.com/raidyue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3c1a85e133ef03a7d4e49121a9acb6d65b11ef56","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raidyue/netty/commits/3c1a85e133ef03a7d4e49121a9acb6d65b11ef56","created_at":"2022-07-08T01:58:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
