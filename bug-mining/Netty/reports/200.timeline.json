MQTT spec states that the bits in the fixed header must be set to specific values depending on message type. If a client sends a message with the wrong bits, the server must treat the message as malformed. Netty did not check the value of the reserved bits in the fixed header.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\nMQTT3.1.1: http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/errata01/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc442180835\r\nMQTT 5.0: https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901023\r\n\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nAdd validation checks to MqttDecoder.java\r\nAdd unit tests to MqttCodecTest.java \r\nFixed two instances where messages were generated for other unit tests with an incorrect fixed header.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFixes #11379.
