They must be specific and should not be done with an \"OR-Logic\" (if a == null || b == null) throw new NullPointerEx.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nSome checks are already done with the io.netty.util.internal.ObjectUtil code. Some are done manually.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\ncheckout the master\r\ngrep -r \"Objects.req\"\r\ngrep -r \"throw new NullPointerException\"\r\ngrep -r \"throw new IllegalArgumentException\" (individual check necessary)\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\nExisting codebase.\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1 (updated version)\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\nNot relevant, all\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nNot relevant, all\r\n\r\n### Providing the fix\r\nOne pull request per sub-project to enable reviewers to focus on a relevant subset. First one is common itself, including a new unit test for ObjectUtil itself.","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11170/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
