Questions\r\nIn our applicatioin, we all upload multiple files using http and using Pump to write contents to HttpClientRequest. And we upgrade from vert.x 3.9.4 to 4.0.3(also tried 4.1.0.RC1) the tests case fails randomly.  The updated code to write multiple files\r\nto HttpClientRequest is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  private void attachFile(String boundary, Iterator<Entry<String, Part>> uploadsIterator) {\r\n    if (!uploadsIterator.hasNext()) {\r\n      request.write(boundaryEndInfo(boundary));\r\n      request.end();\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n    Entry<String, Part> entry = uploadsIterator.next();\r\n    // do not use part.getName() to get parameter name\r\n    // because pojo consumer not easy to set name to part\r\n    String name = entry.getKey();\r\n    Part part = entry.getValue();\r\n    String filename = part.getSubmittedFileName();\r\n\r\n    LOGGER.info(\"Start attach file [{}:{}].\", name, filename);\r\n    request.write(fileBoundaryInfo(boundary, name, part)).compose(v ->\r\n        Future.fromCompletionStage(new PumpFromPart(context, part).toWriteStream(request, throwableHandler)))\r\n        .onComplete(r -> {\r\n          if (r.failed()) {\r\n            LOGGER.warn(\"Failed attach file [{}:{}].\", name, filename, r.cause());\r\n            asyncResp.consumerFail(r.cause());\r\n            return;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          LOGGER.info(\"Finish attach file [{}:{}].\", name, filename);\r\n          attachFile(boundary, uploadsIterator);\r\n        });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nsee details [here](https://github.com/apache/servicecomb-java-chassis/pull/2394/files#diff-eb2ba960b8188b577883b01315ac99bd4fd8531f5eb3d67a6e12a021498c1b30)\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n4.0.3 and above\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nAfter look code at PumpIml \r\n\r\n```\r\n  PumpImpl(ReadStream<T> rs, WriteStream<T> ws) {\r\n    this.readStream = rs;\r\n    this.writeStream = ws;\r\n    drainHandler = v-> readStream.resume();\r\n    dataHandler = data -> {\r\n      writeStream.write(data);\r\n      incPumped();\r\n      if (writeStream.writeQueueFull()) {\r\n        readStream.pause();\r\n        writeStream.drainHandler(drainHandler);\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess the problem happends because vert.x 4.x change \r\n\r\n```\r\nwriteStream.write(data);\r\n```\r\n\r\nto asynchronouse and not make sure if the data is actually written. And in our context, previously we check if a file successfully by ReadStream endHanlder, now the check can not make sure if the upload is successfully and cause the problem. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Do you

The issue is hopefully fixed in Netty (https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/11334) and will be released with Netty 4.1.66.Final.\r\nI created this issue to track the Netty issue, and upgrade Micronaut once 4.1.66.Final is released.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n```\r\nMultipartBody body = MultipartBody.builder()\r\n    .addPart(\"file\", \"image-1.jpeg\", MediaType.of(\"image/jpeg\"), image1Bytes)\r\n    .addPart(\"file\", \"image-2.jpeg\", MediaType.of(\"image/jpeg\"), image2Bytes)\r\n    .build();\r\nphotoClient.upload(\"/username/photos\", body).blockingGet()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I upload the same photos to the target service directly from my browser, the exception is not triggered. It's only when I send files from one Micronaut service to another. And only with some files. Most files/photos are working ok. sigh.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nSending files from one Micronaut service using MultipartBody should work without any exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behaviour\r\n\r\njava.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: index: 276, length: 1 (expected: range(0, 276))\\n\\tat io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.checkRangeBounds(AbstractByteBuf.java:1390)\\n\\tat io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.checkIndex0(AbstractByteBuf.java:1397)\\n\\tat io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.checkIndex(AbstractByteBuf.java:1384)\\n\\tat io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.checkIndex(AbstractByteBuf.java:1379)\\n\\tat io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.getByte(AbstractByteBuf.java:355)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostBodyUtil.findDelimiter(HttpPostBodyUtil.java:238)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.loadDataMultipartOptimized(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:1172)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.getFileUpload(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:926)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.decodeMultipart(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:572)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.findMultipartDisposition(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:797)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.decodeMultipart(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:511)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.findMultipartDelimiter(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:663)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.decodeMultipart(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:498)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.parseBodyMultipart(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:463)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.parseBody(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:432)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.offer(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:347)\\n\\tat io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart.HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.offer(HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder.java:54)\\n\\tat io.micronaut.http.server.netty.FormDataHttpContentProcessor.onData(FormDataHttpContentProcessor.java:119)\\n\\tat io.micronaut.http.server.netty.AbstractHttpContentProcessor.doOnNext(AbstractHttpContentProcessor.java:78)\\n\\tat io.micronaut.http.server.netty.AbstractHttpContentProcessor.doOnNext(AbstractHttpContentProcessor.java:36)\\n\\tat io.micronaut.core.async.subscriber.CompletionAwareSubscriber.onNext(CompletionAwareSubscriber.java:52)\\n\\tat io.micronaut.http.netty.reactive.HandlerPublisher.publishMessage(HandlerPublisher.java:378)\\n\\tat io.micronaut.http.netty.reactive.HandlerPublisher.channelRead(HandlerPublisher.java:334)\\n\\tat io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:379)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment Information\r\n\r\n- **Operating System**: CentOS 7\r\n- **Micronaut Version:** 2.5.8 (also tested with 2.5.7)\r\n- **JDK Version:** 11.0.11\r\n\r\n### Example Application\r\n\r\nIt's hard to create an example application because it only happens with some jpeg files, and only on CentOS. At least I haven't been able to reproduce it on MacOS.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues/5732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues/5732/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6956556473,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c842BQnnzwAAAAGepKC5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/6956556473","actor":{"login":"raidyue","id":2962896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI4OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2962896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue","html_url":"https://github.com/raidyue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"93c8a13dc708030beebd561121fc5ef77c9bc5b3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raidyue/netty/commits/93c8a13dc708030beebd561121fc5ef77c9bc5b3","created_at":"2022-07-08T01:58:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
