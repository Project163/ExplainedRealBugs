A simple fix is to just augment the key\r\nstrength to the minimum required about by FIPS.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nSet default key bit length to 2048 but also allow it to be dynamically set via a system property for future proofing to more stricter security compliance.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFixes #9018 \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Farid Zakaria <farid.m.zakaria@gmail.com>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2260554602,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI2MDU1NDYwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2260554602","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-08T18:08:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2260555815,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNjA1NTU4MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2260555815","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4373a1fba245b3db03cdf3321712d292e2de508b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/4373a1fba245b3db03cdf3321712d292e2de508b","created_at":"2019-04-08T18:09:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2260557070,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNjA1NTcwNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2260557070","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2935944426edc342ea137bf6766901c7fbc5bc41","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/2935944426edc342ea137bf6766901c7fbc5bc41","created_at":"2019-04-08T18:09:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
