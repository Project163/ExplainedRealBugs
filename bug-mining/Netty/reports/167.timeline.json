(Stangely enough, the build downloads GraalVM 20.2.0 on each run, aren't you aware of a way to make it cache the downloaded file? The download is pretty slow).\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not an expert in GraalVM (nor its Native Builder feature). Anyway, it seems strange that any field store could be possible because `NetUtil.LOCALHOST4` field is final. Also, the build of `netty-testsuite-native-image-client` does not trigger this problem, even if the field is referenced directly from the main class.\r\n\r\nWhen I checked out the current 4.1 branch of Netty (the substitutions are already there), added the 3 dummy setters, built the patched Netty version and changed `netty-common` version to the newly-built version, the error you demonstrate has gone, but the build still failed with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    [creator]     [/layers/paketo-buildpacks_spring-boot-native-image/native-image/com.example.springnative.Application:153]     analysis:  39,857.64 ms,  3.71 GB\r\n    [creator]     Error: Classes that should be initialized at run time got initialized during image building:\r\n    [creator]      io.netty.channel.socket.InternetProtocolFamily the class was requested to be initialized at run time (from feature org.springframework.graalvm.support.InitializationHandler.lambda$registerInitializationDescriptor$4). To see why io.netty.channel.socket.InternetProtocolFamily got initialized use -H:+TraceClassInitialization\r\n    [creator]     \r\n    [creator]     Error: Use -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces to print stacktrace of underlying exception\r\n    [creator]     Error: Image build request failed with exit status 1\r\n    [creator]     unable to invoke layer creator\r\n    [creator]     unable to contribute native-image layer\r\n    [creator]     error running build\r\n    [creator]     exit status 1\r\n    [creator]     ERROR: failed to build: exit status 1\r\n\r\n> Task :bootBuildImage FAILED\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, when I downgrade `netty-common` version to the previous release `4.1.53` (which does not contain the substitutions) with\r\n\r\n```\r\n    implementation 'io.netty:netty-common:4.1.53.Final'\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the build fails with the same message as it does with a patched `4.1.54`.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the suggested addition of setters could help fix the version with substitutions, but it would be great to get rid of all other build errors (like the highlighted problem with `InternetProtocolFamily`) because for now such a fix looks like a blind shot. I still don't understand why a setter should be needed for a final field.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/727560345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rpuch","id":3244433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQ0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3244433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch","html_url":"https://github.com/rpuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3997353910,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk5NzM1MzkxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/3997353910","actor":{"login":"ArjanSchouten","id":5930718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzA3MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5930718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten","html_url":"https://github.com/ArjanSchouten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-15T12:13:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3997353911,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5OTczNTM5MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/3997353911","actor":{"login":"ArjanSchouten","id":5930718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzA3MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5930718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten","html_url":"https://github.com/ArjanSchouten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArjanSchouten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-15T12:13:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/727560679","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/10797#issuecomment-727560679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10797","id":727560679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNzU2MDY3OQ==","user":{"login":"rpuch","id":3244433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQ0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3244433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch","html_url":"https://github.com/rpuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-15T12:15:54Z","updated_at":"2020-11-15T12:15:54Z","body":

at run-time\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nIn #10630, field substitutions were introduced for NetUtil.LOCALHOST4, NetUtil.LOCALHOST6 and NetUtil.LOCALHOST fields. They were required to allow a native image be built with most of Netty (including NetUtil) initialized at build time.\r\n\r\nThe substitutions created in #10630 only define getters, so the 3 fields can only be read in a native image.\r\n\r\nBut when NetUtil is initialized at run-time (this is what happens in #10797), its static initialization block is executed, and this block writes to all 3 fields. As the substitutions do not provide any setters, field stores are not valid, and such builds fail.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- Add netty-testsuite-native-image-client-runtime-init Maven module that builds a native image deferring NetUtil class initialization till run-time; this module is used to demonstrate the problem and verify the problem is gone with the fix\r\n- Add no-op setters to substitutions for NetUtil.LOCALHOST4, NetUtil.LOCALHOST6 and NetUtil.LOCALHOST\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nA native image initializing NetUtil at run-time builds successfully.\r\n\r\nFixes

This is embarassing, but with #10630 I broke Netty for the cases when NetUtil is initialized at run-time.\r\n\r\nFYI this change broke native Netty support in Spring Boot 2.4.0. I will adapt our support accordingly.\r\n\r\n> @ArjanSchouten could you please check Netty built from #10799 to see whether it fixes the problem for you?\r\n\r\n@rpuch Thanks for working on a fix, but looking at the changes in #10630, I understand the problem you are trying to solve but maybe we should take a step back on why those changes are needed.\r\n\r\n@normanmaurer Just to give more context, as you know GraalVM native started its life with build time initialization by default, but since is clearly moving towards runtime initialization by default to favor compatibility, avoid to have 2 distinct behaviors of Java to support in the ecosystem, and because build time init is really required in just a few places where it is critical for performances or footprint:\r\n - [GraalVM native 19.0.0](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/release-notes/19_0/#1900) switched to runtime init by default\r\n - [GraalVM native 20.2.0](https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/20_2/) moved most of the JDK to runtime init\r\n - I think GraalVM and Project Leyden teams are trying to limit the differences of behavior in order to avoid to have 2 different behaviors of Java, in order to avoid a maintainability nightmare well illustrated by those changes\r\n - I think @vjovanov from GraalVM team is about to provide a PR to restore by default runtime init by default in Netty.\r\n\r\nIn a nustshell, my proposal is to:\r\n - Rollback #10630 changes\r\n - Merge @vjovanov upcoming PR in order to restore defaults consistent with GraalVM one, with more consistency between JVM and native\r\n - Evolve Netty native support with a goal of limiting substitutions, favor consistency about JVM and native flavors, make Netty consistent with other libraries that are by default initialized at runtime in GraalVM native\r\n - Use build time init if needed on the few classes where there are needed to perform build time code removal or when critical for performances\r\n - Document with @rpuch and others interested how to use Netty with build time init and sync with them in order to allow them to adapt to those

Of course, all issues related to build-time initialization from GraalVM shall be redirected to those project or that repo.
