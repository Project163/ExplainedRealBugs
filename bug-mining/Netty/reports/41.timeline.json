environments with a security manager, the reflective access to get the reference to\r\nThrowable#addSuppressed can cause issues that result in Netty failing to load. The main\r\nmotivation in this pull request is to remove the use of reflection to prevent issues in\r\nthese environments.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nThrowableUtil no longer uses Class#getDeclaredMembers to get the Method that references\r\nThrowable#addSuppressed and instead guards the call to Throwable#addSuppressed with a\r\nJava version check.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a annotation was added that suppresses the animal sniffer java16 signature\r\ncheck on the given method. The benefit of the annotation is that it limits the exclusion\r\nof Throwable to just the ThrowableUtil class and has string text indicating the reason\r\nfor suppressing the java16 signature check.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nNetty no longer requires the use of Class#getDeclaredMethod for ThrowableUtil and will\r\nwork in environments restricted by a security manager without needing to grant reflection\r\npermissions.\r\n\r\nFixes
