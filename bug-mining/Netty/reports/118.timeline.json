The race condition is intrinsic to the protocol: there is no way for a peer to send a RST and ensure that there are not DATA (or other frames) already in flight. The docs at the origin of the exception [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder.java#L532) even describe the situation. \r\n\r\nI think the behavior we have now is about as good as we can hope for other than we shouldn't pollute logs with it, at least at info or higher levels. Sending a RST in response to these frames is probably smart to combat bad behavior of peers, though the spec does say the frames should be ignored.\r\n\r\nThere is one way we could do a little better, but it's slightly complex. We can hubristically tell if the frame is the start of a new stream by the fact that DATA frames will never initiate a stream and trailer HEADERS frames won't contain any pseudo headers. If we do that, we can presume any HEADERS that are not trailers are an out-of-order new stream and we can elevate the exception to a connection level PROTOCOL_ERROR as described in the [spec](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#rfc.section.5.1.1/). Trailer headers and DATA frames can then be presumed to belong to a stream that was RST, and ignored. The drawback is that this doesn't protect against peers that are sending orphan DATA of trailer HEADERS frames, but ignoring them is probably not much worse than sending a RST since this is kind of worst-case peer
