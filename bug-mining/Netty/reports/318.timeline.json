modularization of `netty-codec` lead to stripping `compression`/`protobuf`/`marshalling` from this module resulting in breaking backward compatibility from a build dependency perspective.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nSeveral changes are necessary to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nIntroduce `netty-codec-base` artifact which holds the code of `netty-codec` declaring the `io.netty.codec` module.\r\n\r\n`netty-codec-(compression|protobuf|marshalling)` artifacts depends on `netty-codec-base` instead of `netty-codec`.\r\n\r\n`netty-codec` artifact now ships an empty jar declaring the `io.netty.codec.unused` module (which should be avoided) and depends on `netty-codec-(base|compression|marshalling|protobuf)` artifact, in addition it redeclares the non optional dependencies of marshalling and protobuf as optional.\r\n\r\nCompleted the modular guide with an explanation to the developer.\r\n\r\nRequired revapi changes.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes
