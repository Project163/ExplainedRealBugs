there, and we believe to have found the root cause.\r\nIn our code, we have a piece of code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public ReactiveRegistrationClient registrationClient(ClientProperties clientProperties) {\r\n        final Builder webClient = getWebClient().mutate().clientConnector(new ReactorClientHttpConnector(HttpClient.create().protocol(HttpProtocol.H2).wiretap(true)));\r\n        webClient.filter(ExchangeFilterFunctions.basicAuthentication(Objects.requireNonNull(clientProperties.getUsername()), Objects.requireNonNull(clientProperties.getPassword())));\r\n        return new ReactiveRegistrationClient(webClient.build(), clientProperties.getReadTimeout());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe then removed the ```.protocol(HttpProtocol.H2)```\r\n```\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public ReactiveRegistrationClient registrationClient(ClientProperties clientProperties) {\r\n        final Builder webClient = getWebClient().mutate().clientConnector(new ReactorClientHttpConnector(HttpClient.create().wiretap(true)));\r\n        webClient.filter(ExchangeFilterFunctions.basicAuthentication(Objects.requireNonNull(clientProperties.getUsername()), Objects.requireNonNull(clientProperties.getPassword())));\r\n        return new ReactiveRegistrationClient(webClient.build(), clientProperties.getReadTimeout());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the blocking call disappeared!!!\r\n\r\nMy initial conclusion, is that ```.protocol(HttpProtocol.H2)``` is the root cause of the blocking call.\r\n\r\nHence, would it be possible ```.protocol(HttpProtocol.H2)``` is blocking in a reactive world please?\r\nOr please let me know what am I not doing correctly.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/1508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/1508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4318979689,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDMxODk3OTY4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/4318979689","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-11T10:03:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4318981348,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQzMTg5ODEzNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/4318981348","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6808d7582a06dfb5038ac1dd8fa58190ab359d19","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/6808d7582a06dfb5038ac1dd8fa58190ab359d19","created_at":"2021-02-11T10:03:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4318989215,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQzMTg5ODkyMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/4318989215","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b1ce20c08084703100c71fd51bb6b3e82033807a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/b1ce20c08084703100c71fd51bb6b3e82033807a","created_at":"2021-02-11T10:05:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4319570299,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQzMTk1NzAyOTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/4319570299","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norma
