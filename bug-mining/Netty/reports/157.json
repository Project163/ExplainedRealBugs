Expected behavior\r\nThe runnable passed to scheduleAtFixedRate() should run multiple times, not just once.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nusing UnorderedThreadPoolEventExecutor the runnable is executed just once, using directly the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor or DefaultEventExecutorGroup the task is executed at fixed rate as expected\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code \r\n```java\r\npublic static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n  final UnorderedThreadPoolEventExecutor executor = new UnorderedThreadPoolEventExecutor(2);\r\n  //final ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(2); // THIS WORKS\r\n  //final DefaultEventExecutorGroup executor = new DefaultEventExecutorGroup(2); // THIS WORKS\r\n
