Client side looks more complicated API-wise, because we don't know whether we'll be speaking HTTP/1 or HTTP/2. The current upgrade API is call-back based, where you provide a Handler that will be used when appropriate.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit hard for me to see how this all works, because the current example relies on using HTTP/2 API and then using HttpToHttp2ConnectionHandler or Http2ConnectionHandler depending on the upgrade result. Although, maybe that's what we need here, use a HTTP/2 handler with HTTP/1 conversion logic and if the upgrade is successful the handler would be \"migrated\" to a child channel (although add/removal from the pipeline may be confusing).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, maybe the handler could be a HTTP/1 handler that continues receiving HTTP/1 frames (converted from HTTP/2) until the end of the response, and it just ignores any HTTP/2 frames flowing past. In that solution, there _wouldn't_ be a childchan for the upgraded stream. (Note: the handler could actually speak HTTP/2, but there would need to be another HTTP/1 to HTTP/2 conversion; yes, that means we would convert HTTP/2 to HTTP/1 to HTTP/2 for the upgraded stream.)\r\n\r\nYeah. This would take some time to figure out.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/389663702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/389668898","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7947#issuecomment-389668898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/7947","id":389668898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTY2ODg5OA==","user":{"login":"bryce-anderson","id":2948506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2948506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson","html_url":"https://github.com/bryce-anderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-16T21:18:03Z","updated_at":"2018-05-16T21:18:03Z","body":"Sorry for the confusion about using this client side.\r\n\r\nAn awkward part of the 'flow-past' solution is that you can't manage response backpressure for the upgraded stream in the normal Netty manner since if you turn off auto-read or you stall the whole h2 session.\r\n\r\nMy first inclination is to mange this via a richer event model where if the Http2MultiplexCodec gets installed due to a h2c upgrade, the tail of the pipeline gets an event that provides a handle for the child stream and it's the tail of the pipelines job to make the transition. The transition will be pretty complex, but h2c upgrades are anything but simple.\r\nFor Finagles current usage, since we're not doing the dispatch work in the pipeline, it's relatively easy for us to switch the underlying `Channel`, but this isn't exactly a normal pattern when using Netty directly.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to start putting together something along those lines if it sounds like a reasonable direction to try out.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/389668898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bryce-anderson","id":2948506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2948506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson","html_url":"https://github.com/bryce-anderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/389676043","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7947#issuecomment-389676043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/7947","id":389676043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTY3NjA0Mw==","user":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-16T21:45:39Z","updated_at":"2018-05-16T21:45:39Z","body":"Ah... flow control.
