I discovered this while working on a project for my employer, HubSpot. We are planning to use this field to convey some company-specific authentication information in our internal systems. This bug is somewhat blocking our ability to read these values inside HBase servers, which use Netty for TLS support.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nChange the one-line implementation of this method from `return unwrap().getSubjectAlternativeNames();` to `return unwrap().getIssuerAlternativeNames();`\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nGet the correct values from the certificate.\r\n\r\nFixes #13796. \r\n\r\nThis

my employer we plan on using a coprocessor to log information about some requests to HBase. For this to be useful to us, we need to know who each request is coming from. We use HBase's TLS support with mutual authentication to authenticate clients. I'd like a way to expose the client certificate used on a request to coprocessors. For setups using Kerberos authentication, RpcCall exposes the Kerberos principal shortname via `getRequestUser()`, so this would be the TLS equivalent to that. I've tested this patch applied to 2.5.x in my company's infrastructure.\r\n\r\nI found that in order for this patch to be useful to me, I also need netty to fix a related bug which I reported as https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13796.
