Expected behavior\r\nAll `Runnable` tasks submitted through `NonStickyEventExecutorGroup` should get executed.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nOccasionally the last task submitted is not getting executed.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nThe following unit-test has a non-zero chance of failure (about 1/2 of the time fail on my laptop).\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testRaceCondition() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        EventExecutorGroup group = new UnorderedThreadPoolEventExecutor(1);\r\n        NonStickyEventExecutorGroup nonStickyGroup = new

            final CountDownLatch firstCompleted = new CountDownLatch(1);\r\n                final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(2);\r\n                for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\r\n

                      latch.countDown();\r\n                        }\r\n                    });\r\n                    Assert.assertTrue(firstCompleted.await(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS));\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                Assert.assertTrue(latch.await(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS));\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        } finally {\r\n            nonStickyGroup.shutdownGracefully();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bug Description\r\nIn the `NonStickyOrderedEventExecutor` class inside the `NonStickyEventExecutorGroup` class, when the `execute(Runnable)` method (Line [314](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/concurrent/NonStickyEventExecutorGroup.java#L314)) is called, it enqueues the runnable, followed by checking the `state` to see if it needs to submit itself to the underlying `executor`. However, if at the same time the `run` thread already broke out of the polling loop, but before resetting the `state` to `NONE` Line [260](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/concurrent/NonStickyEventExecutorGroup.java#L260), then the runnable that just get enqueued will not be executed, due to the `compareAndSet` check return `false`,  until the next time `execute(Runnable)` is called again with a new runnable.\r\n\r\nThis bug manifest itself as occasionally a http client is not receiving any response from the server after request was sent if the server side is using `NonStickyEventExecutorGroup` as the event executor group for the child handler.\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1.30.Final-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n1.8.0_151\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nDarwin <host> 17.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 17.7.0: Thu Jun 21 22:53:14 PDT 2018; root:xnu-4570.71.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
