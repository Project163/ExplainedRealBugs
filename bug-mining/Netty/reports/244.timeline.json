this sound very hypothetical (because it makes use of a \"novel\" way to marry event loops and virtual threads), let's assume that:\r\n- a Netty event loop thread is used **as a single threaded carrier thread capable to run continuations/virtual threads**\r\n- The virtual threads \"confined\" to the Netty event loop are already correctly interacting with the existing allocator's `ThreadLocal`s (more on this at https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13191)\r\n\r\nWhat can happen now (after my, sigh :\"( changes to fix https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/12621) is:\r\n1. event loop 1 run all tasks, including virtual thread A\r\n2. A is now \"mounted\" on 1 and require to allocate a pooled buffer, hitting a specific arena's lock L\r\n3. another event loop 2 has been already able to acquire L and is holding it\r\n4. A is virtually parked and will end up in the wait queue of the reentrant lock of L\r\n5. event loop 1 can now execute other tasks, including I/O ones and try to allocate, hitting the same arena's lock L\r\n6. event loop 1 is parked as well, ending up in the same wait queue of L, but given that's a platform thread, is sleeping, awaiting event loop 2 to release the lock L\r\n7. event loop 2 can release the lock L, BUT (so unfortunate!!!) the lock pick A to be unparked\r\n8. unparking a v thread means submitting to its (carrier) executor a task, to resume it BUT event loop 1 is parked (for real) awaiting (forever), that A will resume and try acquire the lock L\r\n\r\nThe easier way to avoid this is to always consider parking dependencies as a platform operation i.e. without involving virtual parking, that CAN exploit the unexpected implicit dependency/order between the virtual thread A and its carrier event loop 1.\r\nThis can be done by reverting reentrant locks with
