#11480 and the use of `CompressionOptions` it appears the `HttpContentCompressor` doesn't handle optional encoders such as Brotli and Zstd properly when using `CompressionOptions`. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if brotli4j is missing at runtime, Http compression is actually  completely broken as the constructor always tries to create `BrotliOptions` even if not specified which result in an `IllegalStateException`.\r\n\r\nThen, if zstd-jni is missing at runtime, a request with `accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, zstd` will fail since `determineEncoding()` still returns zstd resulting in a `NoClassDefFoundError` when the `beginEncode()` method is invoked.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is actually quite different than what's implemented in `CompressorHttp2ConnectionEncoder` which only considers the encoders for which `CompressionOptions` have been specified.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using the `HttpContentCompressor` with `CompressionOptions` without brotly4j or zstd-jni at runtime, we expect the brotly and zstd encoding to be ignored, fallbacking to another encoding or to no encoding following `accept-encoding` HTTP header rules.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n`accept-encoding: gzip, br` should result in a response compressed in gzip\r\n`accept-encoding: br, zstd` should result in an uncompressed response\r\n\r\nIn general, the `HttpContentCompressor` should only consider the encodings corresponding to the `CompressionOptions` provided to the constructor.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the `HttpContentCompressor` is created with `GzipOptions` only, then only gzip encoding should be accepted and a response to a request with different accept encodings should be uncompressed. This behaviour is the same as for `CompressorHttp2ConnectionEncoder`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nUsing the `HttpContentCompressor` without the brotli4j results in a `IllegalStateException: \"Brotli is not available\"` thrown when it tries to create default `BrotliOptions` in the constructor.\r\n\r\nUsing the `HttpContentCompressor` without zstd-jni results in a `NoClassDefFoundError` thrown when it tries to encode a response in zstd encoding.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a `HttpContentCompressor` with a single `CompressionOptions` such as `GzipOptions`, the constructor actually sets default options for the other encodings and as a result, a response can be compressed using deflate, brotli or zstd encoders event if we didn't want it.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Define a `HttpContentCompressor` with `GzipOptions` in a HTTP server\r\n- Run the server without brotli or zstd-jni\r\n- query the server with various `accept-encoding` headers: `accept-encoding: gzip`, `accept-encoding: br`, `accept-encoding: deflate`...  \r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.66.Final\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n\r\nopenjdk version \"16\" 2021-03-16\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 16+36-2231)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 16+36-2231, mixed mode, sharing)\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\n\r\nLinux 4.19.0-17-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.194-1 (2021-06-10) x86_64 GNU/Linux","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
