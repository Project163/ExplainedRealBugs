of today, Brotli4j does not support macOS aarch64. Currently, in `BrotliEncoderTest`, we use the static block to load the Brotli4j library. However, this could lead to failure when performing this action on macOS aarch64.\r\n\r\nThe `DisabledIf` loads the `BrotliEncoderTest` class to see if the platform is supported or not. Loading this class triggers the static block which eventually leads to `ExceptionInInitializerError`.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nUse `BeforeAll` instead of static block.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFixes
