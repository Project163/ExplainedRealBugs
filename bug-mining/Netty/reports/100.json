For example, given ioTime = 10us\r\n\r\nioRatio of 5 will yield timeout = 190us\r\nioRatio of 10 will yield timeout = 90us\r\nioRatio of 50 will yield timeout = 10us\r\nioRatio of 90 will yield timeout = 1.1111us\r\n\r\nAccording to the documents:\r\n_\"Returns the percentage of the desired amount of time spent for I/O in the event loop.\"_\r\n\r\nSo it all makes sense.\r\n\r\nHowever, when ioRatio is set to 100, I would expect no non-I/O tasks can be executed. However, the reverse is happening, the code disables the timeout altogether meaning non-I/O tasks can take as long as they like.\r\nAlso explained by @Scottmitch in https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6058#issuecomment-262619885\r\n\r\nShould the timeout only be removed when the ioRatio is set to 0, instead of 100?\r\n\r\nThis make more sense to me:\r\nioRatio of 0 should disable the timeout\r\nioRatio of 5 will yield timeout = 190us\r\nioRatio of 10 will yield timeout = 90us\r\nioRatio of 50 will yield timeout = 10us\r\nioRatio of 90 will yield timeout = 1.1111us\r\nioRatio of 100 will yield timeout = 0 and therefore should not allow non-IO tasks? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
