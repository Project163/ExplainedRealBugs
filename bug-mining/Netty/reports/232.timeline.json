default we allocate 2 arenas per core, and each arena that is put to use will allocate a chunk.\r\nIf we don't need a lot of memory, and certainly not compared to the number of cores on a system, then this will take up more memory than necessary, since each chunk is 16 MiB.\r\nBy reducing the chunk size to 4 MiB, we reduce the minimum memory usage by a good deal, in these cases where not much is needed.\r\nThe drawback is that we risk allocating more huge buffers, but this is a fair trade-off since Netty's use cases mostly involve very small buffers.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nReduce the default max order from 11 to 9.\r\nAlso make similar configuration changes in PooledByteBufAllocatorTest, to reduce the memory usage during testing.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nNetty now uses less memory when less

is a back port of #8991\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nWe currently use a thread local cache for all threads which often is suprising to users as it may result in a lot of memory usage if they allocate buffers from outside the EventLoop in different threads. We should better not do this by default to keep suprises to a minimum. Users that need the performance and know what they are doing can still change this.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nChange io.netty.allocator.useCacheForAllThreads to false by
