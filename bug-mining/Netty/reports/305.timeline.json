If each type of DNSCache implementation has its own global cache, it should be able to resolve the issue mentioned above, and the cost of fixing it would be relatively low. In the ResolveWithDotSearchDomain scenario, I have made some small modifications by iterating through all searchDomains and matching 'hostname+ '.' +searchDomain' to search for results in the DNSCache.
