there is a problem with charset resolution from `ContentType` header for SOAP 1.2 using `io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpUtils` class. SOAP 1.2 could have action parameter in `ContentType` header and method `getCharsetAsSequence(CharSequence contentTypeValue)` from `io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpUtils` class just finds charset word and take whole string from this word end to the end.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nResolve charset from `ContentType` header with value `text/xml; charset=utf-8; action=\"someaction\"` as UTF-8\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nResolve charset substring from `ContentType` header with value `text/xml; charset=utf-8; action=\"someaction\"` as `utf-8; action=\"someaction\"`. And then you will get an exception `java.nio.charset.IllegalCharsetNameException`\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nResolve charset from any request which contains action parameter in `ContentType` header value\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.19\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n\r\njava version \"1.8.0_181\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\n\r\nLinux 4.15.0-33-generic Ubuntu 18 ","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
