Here is a short description of why this happens:\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, `Slf4JLoggerFactory.INSTANCE` should not care whether the slf4j implementation is a `NOPLoggerFactory`. The package-private `INSTANCE_WITH_NOP_CHECK` has that additional check, but `INSTANCE` does not. However, because the `INSTANCE_WITH_NOP_CHECK` is a static field, the nop check failing leads to the entire `Slf4JLoggerFactory` class failing to initialize, leading to the error below.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to either revert the change that made the nop check instance a singleton (#11253), or (probably preferred) to move the singleton to a nested class so that the failure does not affect the outer class.\r\n\r\nI can make a PR to fix this issue, however I will have to get new CLA approval since I changed employment since I last signed the CLA, which may take a few days.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```java\r\nInternalLoggerFactory.setDefaultFactory(Slf4JLoggerFactory.INSTANCE);\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould always succeed.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen slf4j uses the noop logger, the code throws an exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: NOPLoggerFactory not supported\r\n\tat io.netty.util.internal.logging.Slf4JLoggerFactory.<init>(Slf4JLoggerFactory.java:45)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.internal.logging.Slf4JLoggerFactory.<clinit>(Slf4JLoggerFactory.java:33)\r\n\tat Main.main(Main.java:6)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project with the `org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.32` and `io.netty:netty-all:4.1.71.Final` dependencies\r\n2. Add the reproducer code from below\r\n3. Run the main class\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport io.netty.util.internal.logging.InternalLoggerFactory;\r\nimport io.netty.util.internal.logging.Slf4JLoggerFactory;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        InternalLoggerFactory.setDefaultFactory(Slf4JLoggerFactory.INSTANCE);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.71.Final\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n\r\nAdopt OpenJDK 11.0.12\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\n\r\n`Linux yawkat-oracle 5.13.0-22-generic #22-Ubuntu SMP Fri Nov 5 13:21:36 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11920/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
