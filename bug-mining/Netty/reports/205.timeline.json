We have had requests to support publishing metrics to dogstatsd via unix domain sockets in micrometer-metrics/micrometer#792, and I was excited to see that reactor-netty has support for unix domain sockets built on top of the support in netty for it. However, the netty support is limited to stream domain sockets and dogstatsd is listening on a datagram domain socket. Since we are already using reactor-netty for publishing statsd metric lines, it would be advantageous to use a built-in netty feature to also support publishing on (datagram) unix domain sockets.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/844757945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shakuzen","id":8924140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjQxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8924140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen","html_url":"https://github.com/shakuzen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/844760092","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6737#issuecomment-844760092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6737","id":844760092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NDc2MDA5Mg==","user":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-20T06:48:06Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T06:48:06Z","body":"@shakuzen I am currently super busy but I would be happy to review a PR and provide feedback.

are use cases when Unix domain datagram sockets are needed for communication.\r\nThis PR adds such support for Epoll/KQueue.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\n- Expose Channel, Config and Packet interfaces/classes for Unix domain datagram sockets.\r\nAll interfaces/classes are in `transport-native-unix-common` module in order to be available\r\nfor KQueue and Epoll implementations\r\n- Add
