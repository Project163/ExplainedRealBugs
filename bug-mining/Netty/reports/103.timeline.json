such as API reference guides used\t\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/blob/master/google-cloud-clients/google-cloud-dataproc/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataproc/v1beta2/ClusterControllerClient.java#L52\r\n\r\n#### Any additional information below\t\r\n\r\nAfter migration to SDK v.0.99.0-alpha from v.0.79.0-alpha we are observing an intermittent bug. After some time, from a few hours to a few days, `io.grpc.netty.shaded.io.netty.channel.ChannelException: eventfd_write() failed: Bad file descriptor` exception happening and all subsequent requests fail with `java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException: event executor terminated` making the whole application instance effectively useless. The stack traces are repetitive (probably due to internal retry logic). We also took a thread dump from one of unhealthy instances: https://pastebin.com/ugx5GiXP\r\nWe didn't see anything similar in case of v.0.79.0-alpha for about half a year it was used.\r\n\r\nWe do not use any tricky configuration for client instantiation. The code snippets above is literally how we do it in our application. The pattern is actually borrowed from [this javadoc](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/blob/master/google-cloud-clients/google-cloud-dataproc/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataproc/v1beta2/ClusterControllerClient.java#L52).\r\n\r\nAfter a talk with @ejona86, it seems like the source of the issue may be prematurely closed  `ScheduledExecutorService`, but this requires further investigation.\r\n\r\nP.S. a bit orthogonal question about best practices of using clients. According to [this comment](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/issues/1320#issuecomment-254251020) clients are thread safe. We didn't saw this reference during initial implementation and simply stick to example from javadocs. Now we spin up a new instance `ClusterControllerClient` on every request and dispose it right after (using try-with-resources). Is this approach justified in any way, or it is better to share client for different requests and reuse it as long as possible?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/googleapis/google-cloud-java/issues/5810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/googleapis/google-cloud-java/issues/5810/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2563748392,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1NjM3NDgzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2563748392","actor":{"login":"njhill","id":16958488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTU4NDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16958488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill","html_url":"https://github.com/njhill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"432b2a26b59390511a4973e62270307852537b55","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/njhill/netty/commits/432b2a26b59390511a4973e62270307852537b55","created_at":"2019-08-17T03:05:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"njhill","id":16958488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTU4NDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16958488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill","html_url":"https://github.com/njhill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-17T03:11:07Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T03:11:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9476","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9476/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9476/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9476/events","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9476","id":481840931,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzA4MjYyMTA3","number":9476,"title":"Use

discovered a non-hypothetical race condition during `EpollEventLoop` shutdown where wakeup writes can complete after the eventfd has been closed and subsequently reassigned by the kernel.\r\n\r\nThis fix is an alternative to #9388, using `eventfd_read` to hopefully close the gap completely, and without involving an additional CAS during wakeup.\r\n\r\nModification\r\n\r\nAfter waking from `epollWait`, CAS the `wakenUp` atomic from 0 to 1. The times that a value of 1 is encountered here (CAS fail) correspond 1-1 with prior CAS wins by other threads in the `wakeup(...)` method, which correspond 1-1 with `eventfd_write(1)` calls (even if the most recent write is yet to happen).\r\n\r\nThus we can locally maintain a precise total count of those writes (`eventFdWriteCount`) which will be constant while the EL is awake - no further writes can happen until we reset `wakenUp` back to 0.\r\n\r\nSince eventfd is a counter, when shutting down we just need to read from it until the sum of read values equals the known total write count. At this point all the writes must have completed and no more can happen.\r\n\r\nResult\r\n\r\nRace condition eliminated.

is another iteration of #9476.\r\n\r\nModifications\r\n\r\nInstead of maintaining a count of all writes performed and then using reads during shutdown to ensure all are accounted for, just set a flag after each write and don't reset it until the corresponding event has been returned from `epoll_wait`.\r\n\r\nThis requires that while a write is still pending we don't reset `wakenUp`, i.e. continue to block writes from the `wakeup()` method.\r\n\r\nResult\r\n\r\nRace condition eliminated.

is another iteration of #9476.\r\n\r\nModifications\r\n\r\nInstead of maintaining a count of all writes performed and then using\r\nreads during shutdown to ensure all are accounted for, just set a flag\r\nafter each write and don't reset it until the corresponding event has\r\nbeen returned from epoll_wait.\r\n\r\nThis requires that while a write is still pending we don't reset\r\nwakenUp, i.e. continue to block writes from the wakeup() method.\r\n\r\nResult\r\n\r\nRace condition eliminated.
