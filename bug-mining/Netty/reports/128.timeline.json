the PR #9003, the issue #8998 was supposedly solved. But actually the fix only made it so the TrustManager can use the specified keystore type instead of also supporting it in the KeyManagerFactory.\r\n\r\nIn my environment, we are using PKCS#11 Keys which are then rejected by the PKCS#12 keystore. A PKCS#12 keystore is created since the keystoreType was set to null by the code from the mentioned PR.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nDo not ignore the keystoreType parameter during the creation of the JdkSslClientContext KeyManagerFactory.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #8998.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9965/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/577773757","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8998#issuecomment-577773757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8998","id":577773757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Nzc3Mzc1Nw==","user":{"login":"bergerst","id":24389548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mzg5NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24389548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst","html_url":"https://github.com/bergerst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bergerst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T17:01:02Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T17:01:02Z","body":"@normanmaurer
