auto-scaling mechanism's internal state, such as thread utilization and active thread count, is not exposed. This makes it difficult for users to monitor and debug the auto-scaler's behavior in production environments.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- Defined a new `EventExecutorChooserFactory.ObservableEventExecutorChooser` interface for choosers that can expose metrics.\r\n- Implemented the `ObservableEventExecutorChooser` interface in the internal `AutoScalingEventExecutorChooser` class.\r\n- Added `activeExecutorCount()` and `executorUtilizations()` methods to MultithreadEventExecutorGroup to expose the metrics to the user.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nUsers can now programmatically access the active thread count and per-thread utilization, enabling integration with monitoring and observability systems.\r\n\r\nFixes

of all — thanks for adding the **active thread count metric** in [#15617](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15617)\nIt’s been very helpful for tracking how auto-scaling behaves in production \n\nWhile testing it, we noticed one edge case:\nWhen the server starts but no requests have come in yet, some `SingleThreadEventExecutor`s stay in `ST_NOT_STARTED`, and the scaling logic doesn’t kick in.\nBasically, `activeExecutorCount` never updates until the first task runs.\n\nHere’s what seems to be happening inside `trySuspend()`:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic boolean trySuspend() {\n    if (supportSuspension) {\n        if (STATE_UPDATER.compareAndSet(this, ST_STARTED, ST_SUSPENDING)) {\n            wakeup(inEventLoop());\n            return true;\n        }\n        int currentState = state;\n        return currentState == ST_SUSPENDED || currentState == ST_SUSPENDING;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nSince the CAS only works from `ST_STARTED → ST_SUSPENDING`, it fails when the executor is still `ST_NOT_STARTED`.\n\nIdeally, executors in ST_NOT_STARTED should not be counted as active in the active executor count,\nso that the scaling logic can accurately reflect how many threads are actually running.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15758/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"leonchen83","id":5235764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzU3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5235764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83","html_url":"https://github.com/leonchen83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonchen83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-17T04:13:31Z","updated_at":"2025-10-17T04:13:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15766","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15766/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15766/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15766/events","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15766","id":3524427436,"node_id":"PR_kwDOABA-c86uONHE","number":15766,"title":"Fix

the addition of the active executor count metric in [#15617](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15617),\r\nwe noticed that the metric and scaling logic behave incorrectly when some `SingleThreadEventExecutor` remain in the `ST_NOT_STARTED` state.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the executors are counted as active even though they have never started.\r\nAs a result, auto-scaling may not behave correctly (e.g., scaling down logic not triggered).\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nUpdated `SingleThreadEventExecutor.trySuspend()` to handle the `ST_NOT_STARTED` case:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic boolean trySuspend() {\r\n    if (supportSuspension) {\r\n        if (STATE_UPDATER.compareAndSet(this, ST_STARTED, ST_SUSPENDING)) {\r\n            wakeup(inEventLoop());\r\n            return true;\r\n        } else if (STATE_UPDATER.compareAndSet(this, ST_NOT_STARTED, ST_SUSPENDED)) {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n        int currentState = state;\r\n        return currentState == ST_SUSPENDED || currentState == ST_SUSPENDING;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ensures that not-started executors can be properly transitioned into a suspended state\r\nwithout requiring them to start first.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #15758.
