https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/11792 and avoid potential corruption issues caused by writable shared buffers.\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\n\r\n`HttpObjectEncoder` sends a duplicate of its static final `ByteBuf` field to encode HTTP chunks, such as `0\\r\\n\\r\\n`. This reused buffer is neither read-only nor unexpandable, and thus anyone in the pipeline can modify or expand it. As a result, `SslHandler` can sometimes expand it and append stuff to it, causing unexpected data corruption.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nMost of the static final buffers in the project are made unreleasable and read-only by wrapping them in `Unpooled.unreleasableBuffer(...).asReadOnly()`. Buffers that were excluded:\r\n\r\n- Unpooled.EMPTY_BUFFER - EmptyByteBuf instances are not readable/writable/releasable. Wrapping this buffer in `Unpooled.unreleasableBuffer(...).asReadOnly()` would change the instance type, since it's a public API it could be a potential breaking change.\r\n- ReplayingDecoderByteBuf.EMPTY_BUFFER - since it uses Unpooled.EMPTY_BUFFER and not releasable too.\r\n\r\nExcluded buffers are marked with `SuppressWarnings` to skip check added in https://github.com/netty/netty-build/pull/12.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes
