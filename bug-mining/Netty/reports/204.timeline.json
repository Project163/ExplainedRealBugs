This was faster for me largely just due to my being less familiarity with Netty code, but also because as @NSProgrammer mentions the Java implementation was too slow and pulling the JNI implementation into Netty looked iffy.\r\n\r\nFWIW we have found that for larger payloads (over about 10kB), the payload size reduction from using Brotli or Zstandard instead of gzip outweighed the longer compression time in terms of improving client-perceived latency, especially over slower networks.\r\n\r\nOur benchmarking also made Brotli look slightly more performant than Zstandard without a dictionary for an equivalent compression ratio, but
