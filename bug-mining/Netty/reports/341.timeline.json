overrides `exceptionCaught` method. If an exception happens in the pipeline before `WebSocketServerProtocolHandler` it closes the channel, leaving the Handlers that follow it unable to handle the `Exception`.\nThis is the `WebSocketServerProtocolHandler's` `exceptionCaught` code:\n\n``` java\n@Override\n    public void exceptionCaught(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Throwable cause) throws Exception {\n        if (cause instanceof WebSocketHandshakeException) {\n            FullHttpResponse response = new DefaultFullHttpResponse(\n                    HTTP_1_1, HttpResponseStatus.BAD_REQUEST, Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(cause.getMessage().getBytes()));\n            ctx.channel().writeAndFlush(response).addListener(ChannelFutureListener.CLOSE);\n        } else {\n            ctx.close();\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThis is my scenario: after an successful handshake, the server has this pipeline:\n`Pipeline = [wsdecoder, wsencoder, WS403Responder, WebSocketServerProtocolHandler, domainHandler, DefaultChannelPipeline$TailContext#0]`\n\nMy server logic is in domainHandler. I set `maxFrameSize` in `WebSocketServerProtocolHandler` to be 1MB. If I send a file bigger than this wsdecoder (`WebSocket08FrameDecoder`) calls protocolViolation, which sends an `CloseWebSocketFrame` to the client and throws an `CorruptedFrameException`. This exception is then captured by `WebSocketServerProtocolHandler's` `exceptionCaught` that closes the channel and doesn't call the next handler's `exceptionCaught` (my domain handler) leaving me no chance to change the behavior.\n\nThis is the `WebSocket08FrameDecoder's` `protocolViolation` code:\n\n``` java\nprivate void protocolViolation(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, CorruptedFrameException ex) {\n        state = State.CORRUPT;\n        if (ctx.channel().isActive()) {\n            Object closeMessage;\n            if (receivedClosingHandshake) {\n                closeMessage = Unpooled.EMPTY_BUFFER;\n            } else {\n                closeMessage = new CloseWebSocketFrame(1002, null);\n            }\n            ctx.writeAndFlush(closeMessage).addListener(ChannelFutureListener.CLOSE);\n        }\n        throw ex;\n    }\n```\n\nThanks for this amazing framework, I'm learning a lot thanks to you :-)\n\nSaludos.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/3063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/3063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/298413773","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6663#issuecomment-298413773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6663","id":298413773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODQxMzc3Mw==","user":{"login":"mkw","id":451208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTIwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/451208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw","html_url":"https://github.com/mkw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-01T19:46:10Z","updated_at":"2017-05-01T19:46:10Z","body":"I'd like to fix this.  Options for fixing:\r\n\r\n1. (trivial) Throw an exception on incompressible data and kill the connection.  This is crude, but the connection already dies with a max frame size exception if it's at the boundary, anyway, so at minimum, this would make the failure happen on the sending side, which has more opportunity to prevent it.\r\n2. Making the WebSocket encoders reject frames that are too large; this is less severe than the first option, and again gets the error back to the sending side, but not a whole lot better.\r\n3. Add a max frame size parameter to `io.netty.handler.codec.http.websocketx.extensions.compression.WebSocketClientCompressionHandler` and `io.netty.handler.codec.http.websocketx.extensions.compression.WebSocketServerCompressionHandler` and thread it through to `io.netty.handler.codec.http.websocketx.extensions.compression.PerMessageDeflateClientExtensionHandshaker` and `io.netty.handler.codec.http.websocketx.extensions.compression.PerMessageDeflateServerExtensionHandshaker`, respectively.  (For per-frame encoding, just send uncompressed frames when they grow after compression.)  Use the max size to split frames when the compressed value exceeds the max size.  I need to check to see if already compressed frames can be split, but this might require splitting the message pre-compressing and re-compressing.  If compressed frames can be split, a really intelligent version of this might try to add the extra bytes to the next frame in the message when possible to prevent additional fragmentation.\r\n\r\nPlease

current `ZLibCodecFactory` provides `newZlibDecoder` methods without an option to specify a maximum memory limit for decompression. These methods are utilized in various parts of the project, such as the per-message WebSocket extension. As a result, a client could send a small, maliciously crafted compressed message that, upon decompression, would consume all available memory. This can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError` scenario, which can easily be reproduced as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"io-compute-15\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\n\tat

`maxAllocation` parameter to specify the maximum allowed memory during decompression.\r\n- The older methods have been deprecated in favor of the new ones.\r\n- Public APIs that invoke `newZlibDecoder` now require the `maxAllocation` parameter as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nThis change does not modify the public API behavior, but it encourages users to adopt the updated methods, which include the explicit `maxAllocation` argument, providing more control over memory usage during decompression.\r\n\r\nFixes #6663.

current `ZLibCodecFactory` provides `newZlibDecoder` methods without an option to specify a maximum memory limit for decompression. These methods are utilized in various parts of the project, such as the per-message WebSocket extension. As a result, a client could send a small, maliciously crafted compressed message that, upon decompression, would consume all available memory. This can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError` scenario, which can easily be reproduced as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"io-compute-15\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\n\tat

`maxAllocation` parameter to specify the maximum allowed memory during decompression.\r\n- The older methods have been deprecated in favor of the new ones.\r\n- Public APIs that invoke `newZlibDecoder` now require the `maxAllocation` parameter as well.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nThis change does not modify the public API behavior, but it encourages users to adopt the updated methods, which include the explicit `maxAllocation` argument, providing more control over memory usage during decompression.\r\n\r\nFixes
