in 4.1.49 this runs in seconds, whereas in 4.1.50 it takes minutes.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\nWe have [this](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/e991de19337591cde444fbede010cb8bdc7f118f/flink-runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/rest/FileUploadHandlerTest.java) test in Apache Flink that exhibits the problem.\r\nI can try to write a minimal reproducer if requested; may take some time to figure out how to correctly create the requests :/\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.50\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\n\r\nWindows 10, but we also saw it on ubuntu linux","closed_by":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
