currently does not support the `Partitioned` attribute for response cookies. \r\nhttps://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd/chips\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nSince adding new methods to the `Cookie` interface is backwards-incompatible, the attribute has been solely added to the `DefaultCookie` class. Moreover, the `Partitioned` attribute is not included in the current `RFC6265`. `ServerCookieEncoder` and `ClientCookieDecoder` have been updated accordingly to process this value.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nResponse cookies with the `Partitioned` attribute set can be read or written by Netty. \r\nFixes
