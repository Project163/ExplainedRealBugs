can not call `doDeregister` to cancel the key of the channel from the selector in the `io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel.AbstractUnsafe#shutdownOutput(io.netty.channel.ChannelPromise, java.lang.Throwable)` method。\r\n\r\n- because we should ensure the side which enbale `SO_LINGER` and call `showdownOutput` to start TCP half-closure in fin_wait2 state can still receive and process the data which is send by another side in the close_wait state。\r\n\r\n- and the shutdown function does not block regardless of the SO_LINGER setting on the socket,so we don't need to use GlobalEventExecutor to execute the shutdown\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nIn summary there is no need to call `prepareToClose()` in the `AbstractChannel.AbstractUnsafe#shutdownOutput` method\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes issue #11981 \r\n\r\nclient in the FIN_WAIT2 state can read and process these data which is sended by server in the CLOSE_WAIT state，when SO_LINGGER is used in the TCP half-closed scenario\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5874503934,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85BYaK6zwAAAAFeJdD-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/5874503934","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d60ea595bcd2399530d8becbced45df0b9b22aa5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/d60ea595bcd2399530d8becbced45df0b9b22aa5","created_at":"2022-01-11T15:56:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5874506420,"node_id":"MIE_lADOABA-c85BYaK6zwAAAAFeJdq0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/5874506420","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-11T15:56:27Z","milestone":{"title":"4.1.73.Final"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5874592349,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85BYaK6zwAAAAFeJypd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/5874592349","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"927d04c264b7d1712713946309bb920773af2757","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/927d04c264b7d1712713946309bb920773af2757","created_at":"2022-01-11T16:05:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5874594202,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA-c85BYaK6zwAAAAFeJzGa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/5874594202","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}"
