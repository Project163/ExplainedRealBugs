PcapWriteHandler expects a dedicated OutputStream, and cannot support multiple streams written to a single pcap file. These modifications are intended to support sharing the OutputStream between multiple concurrent PcapWriteHandler instances.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nAdded a \"shareOutputStream\" flag to PcapWriteHandler (and PcapWriter) to enable synchronization on the OutputStream in order to prevent interleaved writes. Also provide a method to write the pcap Global Header to the OutputStream.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nAllows multiple channels to write to the same pcap file.
