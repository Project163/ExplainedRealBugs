For now, it could be done only by parsing the exception's message.\r\nTo simplify such use cases I'd like to introduce the sub-class of the WebSocketHandshakeException and enrich it with actual Http status to avoid extra string parsing.\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nIn the case of the wrong Http Status during Handshake throw WrongStatusWebSocketHandshakeException (for example) with Http status as an exception field\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nActual Http status code could be only obtained by parsing exception's message of the WebSocketHandshakeException.\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nTry to establish a web-socket  connection with a server which returns not 101 HttpStatus code\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\nI can create a reproducible  sample, but it seems obvious from the code\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/websocketx/WebSocketClientHandshaker13.java#L274\r\n(same for other Handshaker implementations ).\r\n\r\nI omitted versions since they are not relevant in this case.","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
