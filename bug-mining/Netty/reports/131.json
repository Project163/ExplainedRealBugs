This happens [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder.java#L215).\r\n\r\nA work around is to add a listener to the `Http2Connection` that eagerly sends another copy of the `Http2GoAwayFrame` down the pipeline. This works because [connection listeners get called](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/DefaultHttp2Connection.java#L234) before the extra streams are culled, but that is also painful because the `DefaultHttp2GoAwayFrame` [constructor](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/DefaultHttp2GoAwayFrame.java#L80) that allows your to set the `lastStreamId` is package private.\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1.43.Final but also appears to affect 4.1","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9986/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
