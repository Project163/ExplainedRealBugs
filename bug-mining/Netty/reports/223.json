shown in the picture above。\r\n\r\n**when `SO_LINGGER` is used in the client side**, and client call `NioSocketChannel#shutdownOutput()` to **half close** the tcp connection。\r\n\r\nthen server side `OP_READ` is active，server begin to `shutdowninput` and `triger ChannelInputShutdownEvent`，next send some  data to client in the process handler of the ChannelInputShutdownEvent event。\r\n\r\n###
