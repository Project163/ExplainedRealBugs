The accounting is done in a bad place, where we might either miss out on activity happening at the cache layer, or we'll have the same memory activity accounted twice. I need to find a better place to do the accounting of the pinned memory.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1010119293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5875049760,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85BZ1QczwAAAAFeLiUg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/5875049760","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"224777f16c2794ea41d9a50bc6ca1821a73a8274","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisvest/netty/commits/224777f16c2794ea41d9a50bc6ca1821a73a8274","created_at":"2022-01-11T17:09:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5875095713,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85BZ1QczwAAAAFeLtih","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/5875095713","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ffcec3872dbde29695fb8d0e03b4ea8823a31cce","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisvest/netty/commits/ffcec3872dbde29695fb8d0e03b4ea8823a31cce","created_at":"2022-01-11T17:17:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-11T17:18:05Z","updated_at":"2022-01-11T17:18:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11
