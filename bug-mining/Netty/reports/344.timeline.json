now the default compression level inside the used Deflater is defined as \"-1\", which according to zlib manual also defaults to \"6\" which is used inside netty as the default. That said, we should also allow to provide Deflater.DEFAULT_COMPRESSION (-1) as an argument.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\nThe range check has been modified to allow for -1 and it now uses the constants instead of magic numbers. Small regression test added which just makes sure that no exception is thrown when provided.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFixes
