Warning\r\n\r\nWithout access to `sun.misc.Unsafe`, Netty is unable to eagerly free direct `ByteBuffer` instances, and instead has to rely on the garbage collector and reference processing.\r\n\r\nThis delays the freeing of unused memory, and can cause greatly increase the memory usage of busy systems.\r\n\r\nTo revert the Netty behavior and permit it to eagerly free memory, apply one of the following settings to your JVM command line:\r\n\r\n* `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=allow` (preferred)\r\n* `-Dio.netty.noUnsafe=false` (may or may not work for shaded libraries)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, upgrade to Netty 4.2 where we are able to apply a long-term work-around.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/netty/netty/wiki/Java-24-and-sun.misc.Unsafe for more information.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nJava 24 has started to print warnings when `sub.misc.Unsafe` is used to access memory. See JEP 498: https://openjdk.org/jeps/498\r\n\r\nPeople tend to be sensitive to new warnings and errors printed by the JVM, so we should avoid enabling `Unsafe` by default on Java 24 onwards.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nEffectively change the default value of the `io.netty.noUnsafe` system property for Java 24 onwards, but in a way where we can tell if it was explicitly set to a given value or if it follows the default.\r\n\r\nAny sort of explicit settings, be it `-Dio.netty.noUnsafe=false` or `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=allow`, will continue to work as before.\r\n\r\nManually verified that the changes work as intended on Java 24.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nNo more warnings printed to the console on Java 24+.\r\n\r\nFixes

24 has started to print warnings when `sub.misc.Unsafe` is used to access memory. See JEP 498: https://openjdk.org/jeps/498\r\n\r\nPeople tend to be sensitive to new warnings and errors printed by the JVM, so we should avoid enabling `Unsafe` by default on Java 24 onwards.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nEffectively change the default value of the `io.netty.noUnsafe` system property for Java 24 onwards, but in a way where we can tell if it was explicitly set to a given value or if it follows the default.\r\n\r\nAny sort of explicit settings, be it `-Dio.netty.noUnsafe=false` or `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=allow`, will continue to work as before.\r\n\r\nManually verified that the changes work as intended on Java 24.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nNo more warnings printed to the console on Java 24+.\r\n\r\nFixes

#14975, `EXPLICIT_NO_UNSAFE_CAUSE` has a dependency to `JAVA_VERSION`, which is initialized after it. When `explicitNoUnsafeCause0()` tries to set `io.netty.noUnsafe` to true by default on Java 24, it fails, because `javaVersion()` always returns 0 at that point.\r\n\r\nAlso, `isAndroid0()` is called twice, once in `javaVersion0()` and once to initialize `IS_ANDROID`. This is not a bug or a performance issue, but it does have a visible side-effect when debug logging is enabled.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nThe declaration of `EXPLICIT_NO_UNSAFE_CAUSE` is moved after `JAVA_VERSION`, ensuring `javaVersion()` returns the correct version when `explicitNoUnsafeCause0()` calls it.\r\n\r\n`IS_ANDROID` is also moved before `JAVA_VERSION`, such that the `isAndroid0()` method is called only once.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #14942 correctly\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15077/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
