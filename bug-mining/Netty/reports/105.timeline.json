When it is used this way, there is no guarantee that the thread that initialized the class is the same thread that is performing the `canEncode` check (and actually it's very unlikely).  I think that instead of using a single static encoder, the constructor should be calling `CharsetUtil.encoder(CharsetUtil.US_ASCII)` every time to ensure that it gets the correct thread-local encoder instance for its thread.

appears to be a thread-safety issue in the way that `SocksAuthRequest` is using its `CharsetEncoder` instance.  `CharsetUtil#encoder` returns a cached thread-local encoder instance, so it is not correct to store this instance in a static member variable and reuse it across multiple threads.  The result is an occasional `IllegalStateException` as in the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Current state = RESET, new state = FLUSHED\r\n\tat java.base/java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder.throwIllegalStateException(CharsetEncoder.java:989)\r\n\tat java.base/java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder.flush(CharsetEncoder.java:672)\r\n\tat java.base/java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder.encode(CharsetEncoder.java:801)\r\n\tat java.base/java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder.canEncode(CharsetEncoder.java:907)\r\n\tat java.base/java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder.canEncode(CharsetEncoder.java:982)\r\n\tat io.netty.handler.codec.socks.SocksAuthRequest.<init>(SocksAuthRequest.java:43)\r\n```\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nInstead of retrieving the thread-local encoder instance once and storing it as a static member instance, the encoder should be retrieved each time the constructor is invoked.  This change prevents any potential concurrency issues where multiple threads may end up using the same encoder instance.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #9556. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/529587637","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/9556#issuecomment-529587637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9556","id":529587637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTU4NzYzNw==","user":{"login":"jbaldassari","id":307312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/307312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari","html_url":"https://github.com/jbaldassari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaldassari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-09T17:37:21Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T17:37:21Z","body":"PR posted: https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9558\r\n\r\nI think this is my first netty PR, so please let me know if I'm missing something.
