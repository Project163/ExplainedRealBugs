behavior\r\nEncountering an exception \"Received fatal alert: handshake_failure\".\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nThe Netty example project for http2 client can be re-used for reproducing the by just changing the host to deckofcardsapi.com and port to 443 and url to \"/api/deck/new/shuffle/?deck_count=1\"\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to
