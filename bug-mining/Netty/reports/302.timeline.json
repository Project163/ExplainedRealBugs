This PR has been replaced by #22810\r\n\r\nFixes #22601 #21892 #19460\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn Pulsar, there are multiple reported issues where the transferred output gets corrupted and fails with exceptions around invalid reader and writer index. One source of these issues are the ones which occur only when TLS is enabled.\r\n\r\nI found these Netty issues that provide a lot of context:\r\n* https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6184\r\n* https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2761\r\n* https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1865\r\n  * https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/a74149e9848fef73d909dd56843e0fbab23f877d\r\n* https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1801\r\n  * https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1797\r\n  * https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/6f79291d5bf7c515549234ed93dc00b84ce008c9\r\n* https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1925\r\n\r\nIt seems that this is a long time issue in Netty  and it has been partially fixed. However, it's not fixed for many locations in the Netty code base and it's not safe to share ByteBuf instances in all cases. \r\n\r\nIn Pulsar, the sharing of ByteBuf instance happens in this case at least via the broker cache ([RangeEntryCacheManagerImpl](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/cache/RangeEntryCacheManagerImpl.java)) and the pending reads manager ([PendingReadsManager](org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.impl.cache.PendingReadsManager)).\r\n\r\nThe SslHandler related issue was originally reported in Pulsar in 2018 with #2401 . The fix that time was #2464.\r\nThe ByteBuf `.copy()` method was used to copy the ByteBuf. The problem with this change is that `.copy()` itself isn't thread safe and accesses the internalNioBuffer instance directly.\r\n\r\nThis happens at least when the ByteBuf instance contains a ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf wrapper. This can be seen in the code https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/243de91df2e9a9bf0ad938f54f76063c14ba6e3d/buffer/src/main/java/io/netty/buffer/ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf.java#L412-L433 . \r\n\r\nAs a result of this, exceptions such as these ones occur:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: newPosition > limit: (2094 > 88)\r\n    at java.base/java.nio.Buffer.createPositionException(Buffer.java:341)\r\n    at java.base/java.nio.Buffer.position(Buffer.java:316)\r\n    at java.base/java.nio.ByteBuffer.position(ByteBuffer.java:1516)\r\n    at java.base/java.nio.HeapByteBuffer.get(HeapByteBuffer.java:185)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.UnpooledHeapByteBuf.setBytes(UnpooledHeapByteBuf.java:268)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.writeBytes(AbstractByteBuf.java:1113)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf.copy(ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf.java:431)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.DuplicatedByteBuf.copy(DuplicatedByteBuf.java:210)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.copy(AbstractByteBuf.java:1194)\r\n    at org.apache.pulsar.common.protocol.ByteBufPair$CopyingEncoder.write(ByteBufPair.java:149)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeWrite0(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:893)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeWrite(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:875)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.write(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:984)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.write(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:868)\r\n    at org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.PulsarCommandSenderImpl.lambda$sendMessagesToConsumer$1(PulsarCommandSenderImpl.java:277)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.AbstractEventExecutor.runTask(AbstractEventExecutor.java:173)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.AbstractEventExecutor.safeExecute(AbstractEventExecutor.java:166)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.runAllTasks(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:470)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.epoll.EpollEventLoop.run(EpollEventLoop.java:413)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor$4.run(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:997)\r\n    at io.netty.util.internal.ThreadExecutorMap$2.run(ThreadExecutorMap.java:74)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.FastThreadLocalRunnable.run(FastThreadLocalRunnable.java:30)\r\n    at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:840)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.nio.BufferUnderflowException\r\n    at java.base/java.nio.HeapByteBuffer.get(HeapByteBuffer.java:183)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.UnpooledHeapByteBuf.setBytes(UnpooledHeapByteBuf.java:268)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.writeBytes(AbstractByteBuf.java:1113)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf.copy(ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf.java:431)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.DuplicatedByteBuf.copy(DuplicatedByteBuf.java:210)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.copy(AbstractByteBuf.java:1194)\r\n    at org.apache.pulsar.common.protocol.ByteBufPair$CopyingEncoder.write(ByteBufPair.java:149)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeWrite0(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:893)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeWrite(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:875)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.write(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:984)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.write(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:868)\r\n    at org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.PulsarCommandSenderImpl.lambda$sendMessagesToConsumer$1(PulsarCommandSenderImpl.java:277)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.AbstractEventExecutor.runTask(AbstractEventExecutor.java:173)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.AbstractEventExecutor.safeExecute(AbstractEventExecutor.java:166)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.runAllTasks(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:470)\r\n    at io.netty.channel.epoll.EpollEventLoop.run(EpollEventLoop.java:413)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor$4.run(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:997)\r\n    at io.netty.util.internal.ThreadExecutorMap$2.run(ThreadExecutorMap.java:74)\r\n    at io.netty.util.concurrent.FastThreadLocalRunnable.run(FastThreadLocalRunnable.java:30)\r\n    at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:840)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is likely that `Failed to peek sticky key from the message metadata java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid unknonwn tag type: 4` exceptions are also caused by the same root cause.\r\n`java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: readerIndex: 31215, writerIndex: 21324 (expected: 0 <= readerIndex <= writerIndex <= capacity(65536))` type of exceptions on the broker side are possibly caused by the same root cause as well.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of such exceptions could also be different. A shared Netty ByteBuf must have at least have an independent view created with `duplicate`, `slice` or `retainedDuplicate` if the readerIndex is mutated.\r\nThe ByteBuf instance must also be properly shared in a thread safe way. Failing to do that could result in similar symptoms and this PR doesn't fix that.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Remove the ByteBufPair.CopyingEncoder and make the ByteBufPair.Encoder suitable for both use cases\r\n  - A read-only ByteBuf needs to be passed to SslHandler so that it doesn't get mutated. A deep copy isn't required. This solution is also more performant since there will be less memory copies.\r\n- Workaround an IntelliJ issue where it shows a red mark in PulsarChannelInitializer classes (casting to ChannelHandler fixes the issue).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to share the reference count ownership to the read-only wrapper returned by `.asReadOnly()` in a similar way as `.duplicate()` behaves.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is well explained in a comment in AbstractPooledDerivedByteBuf:\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/5085cef149134951c94a02a743ed70025c8cdad4/buffer/src/main/java/io/netty/buffer/AbstractPooledDerivedByteBuf.java#L32-L37\r\n\r\nWithout this support, it makes `.asReadOnly()` buffers unsuitable for use in writing to a channel pipeline where the reference count is decreased after the write completes. This would be needed for the use case explained in #14069 where it would be desired to write a shared ByteBuf instance to multiple clients that use TLS connections. One of the solution proposals would be to make the ByteBuf a read-only buffer so that SslHandler knows to avoid mutating the buffer.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe read-only wrapper doesn't call parent.release on deallocation. This makes it unsuitable for ctx.write calls where the reference count is decremented after the writing completes and this propagates to the parent buffer.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.108\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14075/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/2128706195","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/14069#issuecomment-2128706195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14069","id":2128706195,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c85-4XqT","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-24T06:48:52Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T06:48:52Z","body":"@normanmaurer there's another obstacle in supporting this use case where where a cached ByteBuf is sent to multiple clients use SslHandler. I believe that this is a very common and generic use case and it exists in Apache Pulsar. \r\nThe solution idea was to first call `.asReadOnly()` for the original source ByteBuf before adding it to the cache.\r\nHowever, this won't work since the read-only buffer doesn't support reference counting in the same way as a `.duplicate()` buffer. I've created another issue #14075 about this.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/2128706195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12919897707,"node_id":"MEE_lADOABA-c86Jt6QkzwAAAAMCFf5r","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/12919897707","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-24T06:48:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12919897716,"node_id":"SE_lADOABA-c86Jt6QkzwAAAAMCFf50","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/12919897716","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-24T06:48:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/2129279047","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/14069#issuecomment-2129279047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14069","id":2129279047,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c85-6jhH","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:15:55Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:15:55Z","body":"@chrisvest
