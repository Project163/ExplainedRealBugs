`HttpObjectAggregator`, when it encounters a too-large-message, [does the following](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectAggregator.java#L281) when handling a too large response:\r\n```java\r\nctx.close();\r\nthrow new TooLongFrameException(\"Response entity too large: \" + oversized);\r\n```\r\nThe tail of the pipeline gets an `exceptionCaught` event before receiving a `channelInactive` event because channel deregistration is always done '[later](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/transport/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/AbstractChannel.java#L813)'. This is not the case in the `Http2ChannelUnsafe` which triggers shutdown events [immediately](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/Http2MultiplexCodec.java#L925). That means when using the `HttpObjectAggregator` in a stream channel, we will receive  the`channelInactive` event before the `exceptionCaught` event, making it difficult to handle gracefully.\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.26-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_162\"\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nDarwin","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
