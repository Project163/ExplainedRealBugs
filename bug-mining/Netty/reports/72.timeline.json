on shutdown\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nThere is a racy UnsupportedOperationException instead because the task removal is delegated to MpscChunkedArrayQueue that does not support removal. This happens with SingleThreadEventExecutor that overrides the newTaskQueue to return an MPSC queue instead of the LinkedBlockingQueue returned by the base class such as NioEventLoop, EpollEventLoop and KQueueEventLoop.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- Catch the UnsupportedOperationException\r\n- Add unit test.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFix

current implementation of isolation groups [1] requires the\r\ninstantiation of a new IsolatingClassLoader, which contains all JARs\r\nfrom the class path of the SystemClassLoader. Before Java 9, this was\r\nsolved by casting the SystemClassLoader to an URLClassLoader to extract\r\nJARs on the class path of the SystemClassLoader.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact, that the SystemClassLoader is not longer an\r\nURLClassLoader in Java 9, this approach will not longer work.\r\n\r\nThis patch implements a way to extract the class path of the\r\nSystemClassLoader which does not require the SystemClassLoader to be an\r\ninstance of URLClassLoader.\r\n\r\nWARNING: This approach will not work for modules, which were introduces\r\nin Java 9, because modules are living in the \"runtime image\" [2]. Due to\r\nthis, it is not possible to pass the module classes into the current\r\nimplementation of IsolatingClassLoader.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]
