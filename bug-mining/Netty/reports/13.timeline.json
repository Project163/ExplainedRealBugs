is an internal detail of HTTP/2 and if possible it would be nice to avoid exposing this in the public interface of the codec-http2. Recently PR https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6589 exposed `HpackDecoder` for extensibility reasons. In this particular case the extensibility point seemed to be focused on creating a different type of `Http2Headers` object than `DefaultHttp2Headers`. I would like to propose an alternative approach to exposing `HpackDecoder` and instead make `DefaultHttp2HeadersDecoder`'s creation of the `Http2Header` object overridable. In this particular case [GrpcHttp2HeadersDecoder](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/netty/src/main/java/io/grpc/netty/GrpcHttp2HeadersDecoder.java) is duplicating logic which also exists in `DefaultHttp2HeadersDecoder` and IMO would be nice to remove this duplication and consolidate the logic in `DefaultHttp2HeadersDecoder`.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6579\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6589","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6591/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"vietj","id":225674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj","html_url":"https://github.com/vietj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-01T19:18:07Z","updated_at":"2017-04-01T19:18:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/1872","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/1872/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/1872/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/1872/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/1872","id":213519575,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTM1MTk1NzU=","number":1872,"title":"Vert.x
