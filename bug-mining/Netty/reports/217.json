When running load tests with compression enabled I expected very little GC activity.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen running load tests with compression enabled I see a lot of GC activity.  This is due to byte arrays allocated on the heap to provide input to zlib Deflater.  When the incoming ByteBuf is direct, we allocate a byte array on the heap and copy the contents into it.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a Netty client that uses a ZlibEncoder\r\n- Write direct ByteBufs to the Channel in a loop\r\n- Observe the increase in memory consumption (using system tools or a profiler)\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n```\r\n4.1.70.Final\r\n```\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_292\"\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_292-8u292-b10-0ubuntu1~20.04-b10)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.292-b10, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\n```Linux peso 5.10.0-1051-oem #53-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 28 08:11:53 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
