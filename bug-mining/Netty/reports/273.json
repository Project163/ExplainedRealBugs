I didn't find a similar information for Socks4 proxy implementations but I would think the requirement is the same (and it seems that OpenJDK socks implementation follow that convention as well: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/5cd8af7622a93afb32f5f3fccdc453096992453c/test/jdk/java/net/Socks/SocksServer.java#L200)\r\n\r\nNetty implementation should also obey the requirement, independently of the buffer internal order\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen an application uses byte buffers with little endian order, Netty socks encoder/decoder do not write the port information correctly, resulting in refused connection for example.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n0/ Setup a socks proxy (using `ssh -D` or `mitmproxy`)\r\n1/ Write a small pipeline to connect to a remote system with a socks proxy handler\r\n2/ Configure the pipeline to use an allocator to generate LE byte buffers\r\n3/ Try and attempt to connect to the remote system \r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1.89\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n```\r\nopenjdk version \"11.0.18\" 2023-01-17\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.18+10 (build 11.0.18+10)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-11.0.18+10 (build 11.0.18+10, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nDarwin  xxx.local 22.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 22.5.0: Mon Apr 24 20:53:19 PDT 2023; root:xnu-8796.121.2~5/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020 arm64","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
