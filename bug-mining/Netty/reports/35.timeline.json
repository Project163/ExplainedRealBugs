the request is fully received (half closed) and so doesn't need any flow control. The response follows flow control like normal.\r\n\r\nThis problem would happen reliably with PUT/POST, but wouldn't be triggered by the GET/OPTIONS that we typically see.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a problem with the `InboundHttpToHttp2Adapter` utility: it doesn't work with consumeBytes, but it does correctly [throw away the onDataRead return value](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/74f24a5/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/InboundHttpToHttp2Adapter.java?utf8=%E2%9C%93#L67) which is the simpler form of flow control. Worst-case, I guess we could hack `Http2FrameCodec.consumeBytes` to do nothing when it's the upgrade stream, say, with logic like `streamId == 1 && stream.getProperty(upgradeKey)` (we'd create upgradeKey; it doesn't exist now). Doing it \"right\" looks pretty ugly; if we leave `InboundHttpToHttp2Adapter` as-is it deserves a warning.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/334593812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/334780144","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7280#issuecomment-334780144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/7280","id":334780144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDc4MDE0NA==","user":{"login":"mosesn","id":156562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn","html_url":"https://github.com/mosesn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-06T14:59:48Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T14:59:48Z","body":"Cool, what do you think the next step should be?
