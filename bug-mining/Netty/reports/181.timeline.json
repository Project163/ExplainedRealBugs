handling was broken, and basically turned into a fixed offset into each allocation address regardless of its initial value, instead of ensuring that the allocated address is either aligned or bumped to the nearest alignment offset.\r\nThe brokenness of the alignment handling extended so far, that overlapping ByteBuf instances could even be created, as was seen in #11101.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nInstead of fixing the per-allocation pointer bump, we now ensure that 1) the minimum page size is a whole multiple of the alignment, and 2) the reference memory for each chunk is bumped to the nearest aligned address, and finally 3) ensured that the reservations are whole multiples of the alignment, thus ensuring that the next allocation automatically occurs from an aligned address.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, (3) above comes for free because the reservations are in whole pages, and in (1) we ensured that pages are sized in whole multiples of the alignment.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that the memory for a chunk is aligned, we introduce some new PlatformDependent infrastructure.\r\nThe PlatformDependent.alignDirectBuffer will produce a slice of the given buffer, and the slice will have an address that is aligned.\r\nThis method is plainly available on ByteBuffer in Java 9 onwards, but for pre-9 we have to use Unsafe, which means it can fail and might not be available on all platforms.\r\nAttempts to create a PooledByteBufAllocator that uses alignment, when this is not supported, will throw an exception.\r\nLuckily, I think use of aligned allocations are rare.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nAligned pooled byte bufs now work correctly, and never have any overlap.\r\n\r\nFixes #11101\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4491352737,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ0OTEzNTI3Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/4491352737","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"836a299b8b41a275bbb9ee5f59e49ac0357b91ba","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisvest/netty/commits/836a299b8b41a275bbb9ee5f59e49ac0357b91ba","created_at":"2021-03-22T16:48:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4491420531,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ0OTE0MjA1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/4491420531","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"809b1da5b29353eeafd3dce007811c5a12bb408a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisvest/netty/commits/809b1da5b29353eeafd3dce007811c5a12bb408a","created_at":"2021-03-22T17:01:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4491445218,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ0OTE0NDUyMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/4491445218","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2ff5b900d4343e816c0fb5621cacb273da4948f7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisvest/netty/commits/2ff5b900d4343e816c0fb5621cacb273da4948f7","created_at":"2021-03-22T17:05:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4497129743,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQ5NzEyOTc0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/4497129743","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.githu
