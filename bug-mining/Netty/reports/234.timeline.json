off, thanks for making and maintaining Netty. Don't take it as a complaint but as a heads up.\r\n\r\nThis is a braking change. It regresses expected behaviour of the LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder.\r\n\r\nThe `protected long getUnadjustedFrameLength(ByteBuf buf, int offset, int length, ByteOrder order)` is marked `protected` it is deemed a point of extension and therefore is a part of the public API. Nothing in the documentation of the method states what behaviour should be expected by the implementors i.e. whether it  is expected to be called once or multiple times. However, prior to the change it was invoked multiple time. As such it is now (was) part of the expected, albeit undocumented, behaviour. \r\n\r\nI have an ASN1 frame decoder, that broker after a recent upgrade that I traced to this change.  ASN1 allows frames of be variable length, the length field itself is variable width. Prior to the change, if the buffer contained partial frame that truncated the length filed, it was possible to first return a frame length that would ensure enough bytes were read to decode the length header. With a subsequent call to the `getUnadjustedFrameLength` decoding a full frame length. I.e. it was possible to progressively decode the length of the frame. After the change this is no-longer possible.\r\n\r\nNot a show stopper, but I can no-longer use provided LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1204704814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bigT","id":387242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzI0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/387242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT","html_url":"https://github.com/bigT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1204720911","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/12171#issuecomment-1204720911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12171","id":1204720911,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c85HzpUP","user":{"login":"AbcCreatorDeep","id":25899093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODk5MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25899093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep","html_url":"https://github.com/AbcCreatorDeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbcCreatorDeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-04T03:42:56Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T03:43:59Z","body":">
