correctly when using JVM instead Native Image.  \n\n#### **Steps to Reproduce**  \n1. Compile a native image using `GraalVM 23.0.1` with a project that includes `netty-incubator-transport-native-io_uring`.  \n2. Run the compiled binary.  \n3. Observe the `UnsatisfiedLinkError`.\n\n#### **Expected Behavior**  \nThe application should run without any `UnsatisfiedLinkError`, similar to when using a JVM ->\n```sh\njava  -jar ../build/libs/demo-0.1.0-all.jar\n```\n\n#### **Environment**  \n- **OS**: _Void Linux_  \n- **Kernel Version**: _6.12.16_1_  \n- **GraalVM Version**: _23.0.1_\n- **Build Command**: \n```sh\n~/.jdks/graalvm-jdk-23.0.1/bin/native-image -cp ../build/libs/demo-*-all.jar org.rybar.elis.demo.ElisBootstrap \\\n  -H:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions \\\n  -O3 \\\n  -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflection_config.json \\\n  -H:ResourceConfigurationFiles=resource_config.json\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty-incubator-transport-io_uring/issues/269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty-incubator-transport-io_uring/issues/269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/2708869157","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/14903#issuecomment-2708869157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14903","id":2708869157,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c86hdhAl","user":{"login":"xhyrom","id":56601352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjAxMzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56601352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom","html_url":"https://github.com/xhyrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhyrom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-09T13:56:06Z","updated_at":"2025-03-09T13:56:06Z","body":"This also happens in the io_uring old incubator -
