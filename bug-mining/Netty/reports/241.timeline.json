It's more expressive, extensible, and composable in many ways, and it's better able to run tests in parallel. But most importantly, it's able to directly run JUnit 4 tests.\r\nThis means we can update and start using JUnit 5 without touching any of our existing tests.\r\nI'm also introducing a dependency on assertj-core, which is like hamcrest, but arguably has a nicer and more discoverable API.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nAdd the JUnit 5 and assertj-core dependencies, without converting any tests at time time.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nAll our tests are now executed through the JUnit 5 Vintage Engine.\r\nAlso, the JUnit 5 test APIs are available, and any JUnit 5 tests that are added from now on will also be executed.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the JUnit 5 infrastructure (no existing tests are changed) that #10757 talks about.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10758/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3941719134,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM5NDE3MTkxMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/3941719134","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-30T15:13:34Z","label":{"name":"help

5 is the new hotness. It's more expressive, extensible, and composable in many ways, and it's better able to run tests in parallel. But most importantly, it's able to directly run JUnit 4 tests.\r\nThis means we can update and start using JUnit 5 without touching any of our existing tests.\r\nI'm also introducing a dependency on assertj-core, which is like hamcrest, but arguably has a nicer and more discoverable API.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nAdd the JUnit 5 and assertj-core dependencies, without converting any tests at time time.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nAll our tests are now executed through the JUnit 5 Vintage Engine.\r\nAlso, the JUnit 5 test APIs are available, and any JUnit 5 tests that are added from now on will also be executed.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the JUnit 5 infrastructure (no existing tests are changed) that #10757 talks about.\r\nThis PR replaces #10758 by moving the JUnit migration to 4.1 instead of 5.x.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10764/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/721618786","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/10757#issuecomment-721618786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10757","id":721618786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTYxODc4Ng==","user":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-04T09:30:12Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T09:30:12Z","body":"JUnit
