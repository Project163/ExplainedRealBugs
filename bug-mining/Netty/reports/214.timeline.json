a buffer ends with the last chunk for a part but containing\r\nonly a CR and no LF neither separator, it ends up with the CR\r\nincluded within the content of the part, which is wrong.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nRare case, but fixed by checking when not getting the delimiter,\r\nnot finding a LineBreak, we check if the last byte of the chunk is a CR\r\nand if the content could be added to the current part (current length +\r\ncurrent buffer length - 1) could lead to the end of the part.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nIf the CR is not part of the HttpData, then the CR can be safely ignored, \r\nwaiting for the future LF and separator, and the buffer minus this CR \r\ncan be added to the part content.\r\n\r\nIf not, the CR is part of the content and shall be included in the HttpData.\r\n\r\nAdd a non regression test.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes
