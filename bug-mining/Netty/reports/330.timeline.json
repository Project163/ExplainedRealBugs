scenarios with a large number of inactive connections, reduce memory usage and improve performance.\r\n\r\nsee https://lwn.net/Articles/815491/\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nImplement IoUringBufferRing and IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT flag for socket recv:\r\n\r\n- Enable the use of IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT in the socket recv when IoUringBufferRing is supported by the current Linux kernel version and IOUringSocketChannelConfig is configured to enable the feature\r\n- IoUringBufferRing elements are not populated immediately; only when submitting recv ops, if there is available space in the current BufferRing, the allocator will be used to allocate a buffer.\r\n- If the res in the recv CQE is -ERRNO_NO_BUFFER, mark the bufferRing as temporarily unavailable. The current and subsequent recv operations will fall back to the old recv path.\r\n- When a ByteBuf allocated from IoUringBufferRing is released by the user, it will be returned to the IoUringBufferRing, and the buffer will be marked as available for reuse.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #14614\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14690/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14690/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/2598166329","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/14614#issuecomment-2598166329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14614","id":2598166329,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c86a3N85","user":{"login":"dreamlike-ocean","id":56702218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzAyMjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56702218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean","html_url":"https://github.com/dreamlike-ocean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamlike-ocean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-17T11:33:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T11:33:25Z","body":"> [@dreamlike-ocean](https://github.com/dreamlike-ocean) please open a PR when you feel there is something ready to review\n\nI've completed the code.
