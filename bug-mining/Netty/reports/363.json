Those fields are package-private, however, so cannot be used by 3rd-party code that was already using `MqttPropertyType` and would like to move away from that. It would be useful if these new constant fields were public, so integrating code does not have to define its own copy of these constants.\n\nFor example instead of \n\n```java\n    // single byte properties\n    static final int PAYLOAD_FORMAT_INDICATOR = 0x01;\n    static final int REQUEST_PROBLEM_INFORMATION = 0x17;\n    ...\n```\n\nturn them public like\n\n```java\n    // single byte properties\n    public static final int PAYLOAD_FORMAT_INDICATOR = 0x01;\n    public static final int REQUEST_PROBLEM_INFORMATION = 0x17;\n    ...\n```\n\nHappy to open a PR if helpful!","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
