https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.2 is says \"any message containing connection-specific header fields MUST be treated as malformed\".\r\nWe already filter these out in our HTTP/1 to HTTP/2 translation code, but if the HTTP/2 frames are originally sent to us with these headers, then we must reject them as malformed.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nImprove the header validation code used by the DefaultHttp2HeadersDecoder to check for, and reject, any connection related headers.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFrames with illegal headers are now correctly rejected, though only when header validation is turned on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12755/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1244783332","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/12798#issuecomment-1244783332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12798","id":1244783332,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c85KMeLk","user":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-13T01:20:45Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T01:20:45Z","body":"Just

is a non-standard header that is not _explicitly_ called out as connection related, even though it can be argued that it is. Regardless, Chrome and Firefox do actually send this header in their HTTP/2 requests, so rejecting these is quite troublesome. Safari doesn't send this header.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nRemove the check for `upgrade-insecure-requests` in the header validation in HpackDecoder. Also update tests to match.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nHTTP/2 requests from Chrome and Firefox are no longer rejected by the header validation.\r\n\r\nFixes #12798","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7372932831,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA-c85Rsz3EzwAAAAG3dgbf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/7372932831","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-13T04:33:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7372934324,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85Rsz3EzwAAAAG3dgy0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/7372934324","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"570c5d75bd172fbb2f6f68685326d4acb3978482","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/570c5d75bd172fbb2f6f68685326d4acb3978482","created_at":"2022-09-13T04:33:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7378549919,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85Rsz3EzwAAAAG3y7yf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/7378549919","actor":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"733266c82513cd27fc7fed4842d19390485fdc27","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/733266c82513cd27fc7fed4842d19390485fdc27","created_at":"2022-09-13T17:04:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
