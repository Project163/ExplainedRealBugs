requires renaming binary components (.so, .dll; for tcnative,\r\nepoll, etc). But the rename then requires setting the\r\nio.netty.packagePrefix system property on the command line or runtime,\r\nwhich is either a burden or not feasible.\r\n\r\nIf you don't rename the binary components everything appears to\r\nwork, until a dependency on a second version of the binary component is\r\nadded. At that point, only one version of the binary will be loaded...\r\nwhich is what shading is supposed to prevent. So for valid shading, the\r\nbinaries must be renamed.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nAutomatically detect the package prefix by comparing the actual class\r\nname to the non-shaded expected class name. The expected class name must\r\nbe obfuscated to prevent shading utilities from changing it.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nWhen shading and using binary components, runtime configuration is no\r\nlonger necessary.\r\n\r\nPre-existing shading users that were not renaming the binary components\r\nwill break, because the packagePrefix previously defaulted to \"\". Since\r\nthese pre-existing users had broken configurations that only _appeared_\r\nto work, this breakage is considered a Good Thing. Users may workaround\r\nthis breakage temporarily by setting -Dio.netty.packagePrefix= to\r\nrestore packagePrefix to \"\".\r\n\r\nFixes #6963\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI have manually tested this with my in-progress shading in gRPC. The default was detected and behaved the same as specifying `io.netty.packagePrefix` before and after this change. Specifying `-Dio.netty.packagePrefix=` overrode the default. My shading config is still a bit broken, so I'm getting some cipher suite failures, but those were pre-existing and unrelated to defaulting the packagePrefix.\r\n\r\nI could have returned `\"\"` instead of throwing `UnsatisfiedLinkError` when the prefix is un-detected, but felt it was better to fail early instead of letting the binary component's linking to fail.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6995/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1171296835,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTE3MTI5NjgzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1171296835","actor":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjI4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"e5a31a4282072a792c4ab1edec5e8446a38b303a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/e5a31a4282072a792c4ab1edec5e8446a38b303a","created_at":"2017-07-20T01:38:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1171297091,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDExNzEyOTcwOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1171297091","actor":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjI4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a54c2a7ae69dc6e2a1c2859cd675ec1598156c38","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/a54c2a7ae69dc6e2a1c2859cd675ec1598156c38","created_at":"2017-07-20T01:38:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1242072821,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyNDIwNzI4MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1242072821","actor":{"login":"liuzhengyang","id":7070174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzAxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7070174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzhengyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhengyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"35f8f148c365f0267ac9e2a8c8a66a92115f8123","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuzhengyang/netty/commits/35f8f148c365f0267ac9e2a8c8a66a92115f8123","created_at":"2017-09-10T04:58:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1497829442,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0OTc4Mjk0NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/1497829442","actor":{"login":"kiril-me","id":1607432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDc0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1607432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiril-me","html_url":"https://github.com/kiril-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiril-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiril-me/following{/other_user}","g
