original case should be preserved whenever possible.\n\nI would agree that if netty and these data structures are strictly the final consumers of the data, then there probably would not be a real issue with violating the spec, but I do seem to recall there being something about a DNS cache in the netty source, and someone might want to use them as a jump-start for their own non-consumer DNS
