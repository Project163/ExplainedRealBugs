Because the wrapper performs an additional DN comparison, a user will see certificate validation fails even if he or she specified `InsecureTrustManagerFactory.INSTANCE`.\n\nTo fix this problem, `InsecureTrustManager` has to extend `X509ExtendedTrustManager` instead of `X509TrustManager`. It will need a little bit of refactoring if we want it to work on older JDK because `X509ExtendedTrustManager` is since Java 7:\n- Extract the current `InsecureTrustManager` implementation into a top level class.\n- Add `InsecureExtendedTrustManager` which extends `X509ExtendedTrustManager`\n- Modify `InsecureTrustManagerFactory` so that it chooses the right `TrustManager` implementation depending on current Java version.\n\nhttps://github.com/line/armeria/pull/303 shows the new `TrustManager` implementation that extends `X509ExtendedTrustManager`, which is pretty trivial to write.\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5910/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
