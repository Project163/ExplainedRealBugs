Expected behavior\r\nAbility to change the logger and level used by `DnsNameResolverBuilder#traceEnabled`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nWhen `DnsNameResolverBuilder#traceEnabled` is enabled, it uses always the logger and level below\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/46cb4015ff25ff2dd3d0dede5c3185ac498e56b0/resolver-dns/src/main/java/io/netty/resolver/dns/TraceDnsQueryLifeCycleObserverFactory.java#L26-L28\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if those can be configured.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n- `DnsNameResolverBuilder#traceEnabled` where one can specify logger and level\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n- `TraceDnsQueryLifeCycleObserverFactory` can be made public and also it can expose construction similar to what `LoggingHandler` provides i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public TraceDnsQueryLifeCycleObserverFactory(Class<?> clazz, LogLevel level) {\r\n        ObjectUtil.checkNotNull(clazz, \"clazz\");\r\n        ObjectUtil.checkNotNull(level, \"level\");\r\n        this.logger = InternalLoggerFactory.getInstance(clazz);\r\n        this.level = level.toInternalLevel();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this approach one will be able to add such observer with `DnsNameResolverBuilder#dnsQueryLifecycleObserverFactory`\r\n\r\nthis second approach will require a dependency to `netty-handler` module\r\n\r\nWdyt?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\ncurrent snapshot\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\njdk 8\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nMac OS
