Spefically, it seems to be the change to stop using a static instance of `CancellationException` in `DefaultPromise#cancel()` that's taking up extra CPU in our case.\r\n\r\nFor context, in the SDK we use a new `WriteTimeoutHandler` that is added to the channel pipeline before sending an HTTP request: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/79a22b071b381ecbce2b94ce7935ed879971f25f/http-clients/netty-nio-client/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/http/nio/netty/internal/NettyRequestExecutor.java#L187-L194. Since this handler `cancel`s the pending task on a successful write (which is pretty much 100% in our benchmark code), a lot of time gets taken up creating the exceptions.\r\n\r\nAdded an SS of the flame graph for a profiling capture I did.\r\n![netty-4-1-39-cancellationexception](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/261310/64210791-07d01780-ce59-11e9-9994-11384670c461.png)\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/527652408/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dagnir","id":261310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTMxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/261310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir","html_url":"https://github.com/dagnir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagnir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2605085884,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYwNTA4NTg4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2605085884","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-03T21:42:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2605085887,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MDUwODU4ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2605085887","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-03T21:42:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2605405172,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI2MDU0MDUxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2605405172","actor":{"login":"njhill","id":16958488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTU4NDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16958488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill","html_url":"https://github.com/njhill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"04b03906761bb405d7b46fd432033ed608d46ced","commit_url":"

reverted some static exception reuse optimizations due to the problem with `Throwable#addSuppressed()` raised in #9151. This introduced a performance issue when promises are cancelled at a high frequency due to the construction cost of `CancellationException` at the time that `DefaultPromise#cancel()` is called.\r\n\r\nModifications\r\n\r\n- Reinstate the prior static `CANCELLATION_CAUSE_HOLDER` but use it just as a sentinel to indicate cancellation, constructing a new `CancellationException` only if/when one needs to be explicitly returned/thrown\r\n- Subclass `CancellationException`, overriding `fillInStackTrace()` to minimize the construction cost in these cases\r\n\r\nResult\r\n\r\nPromises are much cheaper to cancel.
