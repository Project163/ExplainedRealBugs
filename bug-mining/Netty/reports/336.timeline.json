HashedWheelTimer. (#14959) (#14960)\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nIf the user sets a positive `maxPendingTimeouts` of `HashedWheelTimer,` this bug means that the maximum number of tasks can be potentially increased.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nWhen the worker thread expires the tasks of the current tick, `pendingTimeouts` decremented only when the status of `HashedWheelTimeout` is successfully changed from `ST_INIT` to `ST_EXPIRED.` For other cases, `pendingTimeouts` will be decremented in `processCancelledTasks()` when the next tick is reached.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #14959.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15000/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17268817891,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA-c86vilj6zwAAAAQFTT_j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/17268817891","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-15T12:54:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17268817917,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA-c86vilj6zwAAAAQFTT_9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/17268817917","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"37514ce5e8228547b69d6293cb6b7567d1d8d3b3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/37514ce5e8228547b69d6293cb6b7567d1d8d3b3","created_at":"2025-04-15T12:54:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17269199664,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c86vilj6zwAAAAQFUxMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/17269199664","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"37514ce5e8228547b69d6293cb6b7567d1d8d3b3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yawkat/netty/commits/37514ce5e8228547b69d6293cb6b7567d1d8d3b3","created_at":"2025-04-15T13:14:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
