Use the option --initialize-at-run-time=io.netty.handler.codec.compression.BrotliDecoder to explicitly request delayed initialization of this class.\r\n```\r\nUsage of `Brotli` is hidden behind this check (https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpContentDecompressor.java#L70):\r\n```\r\n        if (Brotli.isAvailable() && BR.contentEqualsIgnoreCase(contentEncoding)) {\r\n            return new EmbeddedChannel(ctx.channel().id(), ctx.channel().metadata().hasDisconnect(),\r\n              ctx.channel().config(), new BrotliDecoder());\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nHowever, while parsing the bytecode of this method, native-image will see a new instance of `BrotliDecoder` being created and, as `io.netty` is marked for build-time initialization, try to eagerly initialize it. If `Brotli` is not available, this can lead to a failure during class linking (in this particular case, because `com.aayushatharva.brotli4j.decoder.DecoderJNI` isn't on the classpath), resulting in a failed image build.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nThe easiest way to reproduce this is using `spring-native` samples:\r\n```\r\nexport JAVA_HOME=<path-to-graalvm-21.2-dev>\r\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\r\ngit clone https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native.git\r\ncd spring-native/samples/data-elasticsearch/\r\ngit checkout 49239a7fa24e09bbc91b943df579394fe74ef12c # Necessary because of an existing workaround on `main`\r\n./build.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1.65.Final\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\nReproducible on both GraalVM 21.2 nightlies and 21.3 dev, Java 11\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nReproducible on Linux-AMD64, running Ubuntu 20.04\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11427/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
