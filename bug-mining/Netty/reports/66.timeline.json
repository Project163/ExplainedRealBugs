Motivation\r\nApplications should not depend on internal packages with Java 9 and later. This cause a warning now, but will break in future versions of Java.\r\n\r\n### Modification\r\nThis change adds methods to `UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider` (following after #6844) that parse `/etc/resolv.conf` for `domain` and `search` entries. Then `DnsNameResolver` does not need to rely on `sun.net.dns.ResolverConfiguration` to do this.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\nFixes #8318. Furthermore, at least in my testing with Java 11, this also makes multiple `search` entries work properly (previously I was only getting the first entry).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8319/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mattayres","id":390141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDE0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/390141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres","html_url":"https://github.com/mattayres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattayres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-26T03:27:02Z","updated_at":"2018-09-26T03:27:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redisson/redisson/issues/1174","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redisson/redisson","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redisson/redisson/issues/1174/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redisson/redisson/issues/1174/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redisson/redisson/issues/1174/events","html_url":"https://github.com/redisson/redisson/issues/1174","id":278542894,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzg1NDI4OTQ=","number":1174,"title":"Java 9 warning - illegal reflective access","user":{"login":"giantninja","id":6809166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDkxNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6809166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja","html_url":"https://github.com/giantninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giantninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-12-01T17:43:22Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T05:38:31Z","closed_at":"2019-04-09T05:38:31Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":15823460,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTgyMzQ2MA==","name":"redisson","full_name":"redisson/redisson","private":false,"owner":{"login":"redisson","id":16851431,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE2ODUxNDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16851431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson","html_url":"https://github.com/redisson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redisson/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/redisson/redisson","description":"Redisson - Valkey & Redis Java client.

newer versions of Java beyond 11, illegal reflective access will be denied by default and eventually it will no longer be allowed at all. Currently, Quasar throws an illegal reflective access warning as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred\r\nWARNING: Illegal reflective access using Lookup on co.paralleluniverse.concurrent.util.ThreadAccess (file:/home/user/Desktop/project/lib/quasar-core-0.8.0.jar) to class java.lang.Thread\r\nWARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of co.paralleluniverse.concurrent.util.ThreadAccess\r\nWARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations\r\nWARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there anything that can be done to fix this? I know that for example, netty has fixed their illegal reflective access: https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8318 and pgjdbc has fixed their illegal reflective access as well: https://github.com/bolcom/pgjdbc/commit/586525744aa4c7973375f862a54043ea383d230d\r\n\r\nI think fixing this is important to ensure that Quasar will continue working in Java versions beyond 11. I did not see any other issues mentioning this so I decided to open my own issue for this.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/puniverse/quasar/issues/321/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/puniverse/quasar/issues/321/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"delta-bravo","id":11414592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDE0NTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11414592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo","html_url":"https://github.com/delta-bravo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delta-bravo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-14T14:40:55Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T14:40:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ktorio/ktor/issues/1190","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ktorio/ktor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ktorio/ktor/issues/1190/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ktorio/ktor/issues/1190/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ktorio/ktor/issues/1190/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ktorio/ktor/issues/1190","id":456284193,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTYyODQxOTM=","number":1190,"title":"Upgrade
