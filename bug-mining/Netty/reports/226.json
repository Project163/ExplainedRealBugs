In case of epoll:\r\n`Fragment-Host: io.netty.transport-classes-epoll`\r\nAltered this in my environment (Karaf with Artemis using Netty) and it immediately works then - class EPoll can the nsuccessfully load the native lib being shipped in the fragment bundle.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n4.1.73\r\n\r\n### JVM version\r\nopenjdk version \"17.0.1\" 2021-10-19 LTS\r\n\r\n### OS version\r\nUbuntu 21.10, 5.13.0-25-generic","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
