Expected behavior\r\nDeveloper can build on any platform using a Docker image without having to install additional native packages. Simply cloning the repo and following an one-liner build command should be enough.\r\n\r\nWe should provide a fully-configured Docker image, and also configure the TeamCity CI to use it (I hope it has support for Docker). That way, every build will be reproducible without the million variables that are involved today (OS, OS version, Linux distro, package version, Maven version, etc etc).\r\nFWIW, the Maven version dependency will be eliminated with this PR https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7578\r\n\r\nSample build command:\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it -v /path/to/local/repo:/home/netty/netty netty/netty-build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above command assumes that the default entrypoint to the Docker image is `mvn -f /home/netty/netty clean install`. Of course, the actual path and the build commands can vary, I just made these up.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nBuild is pretty much wild west. For building on Linux, additional native packages need to be installed. Haven't tried on Windows, but I couldn't get it working on a Mac using a Debian VM or Docker image as it kept running OOM. I don't accept having to install a bunch of additional packages on my system for various reasons, security being an obvious one.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nClone the repo and run `mvn clean install`.
