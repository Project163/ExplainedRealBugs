The split package is the single class `io.netty.handler.ssl.ocsp.OcspClientHandler` in this maven module and its only usage is the corresponding test `OcspTest`. This class is an `@Unstable` annotated helper class to perform verification of the OCSP response when using openssl.\r\n\r\nI recommend moving this class to the `netty-handler-ssl-ocsp` maven module or change its package as it could stay in `netty-handler`, since the class is marked as unstable, changing its package seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nBoth are related but are not doing the same thing\r\n\r\n- `netty-handler-ssl-ocsp` is actually a client to interact with an OCSP server\r\n- the class `io.netty.handler.ssl.ocsp.OcspClientHandler` gives an opportunity to validate an OCSP response when using OpenSSL\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
