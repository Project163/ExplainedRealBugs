(Finagle) using the N4 tooling around proxies and just discovered a bug in [`ProxyHandler`](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/handler-proxy/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/proxy/ProxyHandler.java). When auto-read is disabled (our default) a connection established with the proxy server goes into a stall state waiting for a first response and never receives that (fires a handshake timeout). This is a common problem and might be reproduced with both HTTP and SOCKS5.\n\nWhile debugging this we noticed that a response was actually sent by a server, but was never read from the pipeline by a `ProxyHandler` since [it doesn't issue a read-request explicitly](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/handler-proxy/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/proxy/ProxyHandler.java#L194-L211) and relies on auto-read (or previous handlers to issue the read).\n\nThe solution to this bug is pretty straightforward - we have to issue a read request (once for HTTP and twice for SOCKS5) if the auto-read is disabled.\n\nWe're working on the PR (with the fix) right now.\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5933/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
