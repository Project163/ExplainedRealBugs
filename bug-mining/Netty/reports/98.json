Now, it seems to be another issue.\r\nWith 4.1.37.Final I still see heap buffers usage. In logs I found this instances:\r\n\r\n`DefaultFullHttpResponse(decodeResult: success, version: HTTP/1.1, content: UnpooledByteBufAllocator$InstrumentedUnpooledUnsafeHeapByteBuf(ridx: 0, widx: 0, cap: 0))`\r\n\r\nLook like this is due to `DefaultFullHttpResponse` that uses inside `Unpooled.buffer(0)`. Search shows `Unpooled.buffer(0)` usage in 20 different places within current netty codebase (mostly in http and websockets package).\r\n\r\nMy question - is that expected? Shouldn't `DefaultFullHttpResponse` use `Unpooled.EMPTY_BUFFER` instead of `Unpooled.buffer(0)`?","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
