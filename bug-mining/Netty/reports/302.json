A ByteBuf instance might be cached and that's why it's shared. \r\n\r\nAn alternative is to document this limitation clearly in SslHandler javadoc.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nCurrently this will cause problems such as https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/2401 reported in Pulsar in 2018.\r\nThis was mitigated by calling `.copy()` on the input ByteBuf instances with https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2464 . However, this `.copy()` solution had another issue which is reported as #14068. That is mitigated in Pulsar with https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/22760 . \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to reproduce this issue by concurrently passing a ByteBuf instance to multiple channel pipelines that contain a SslHandler.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\nSystem level repro case for Pulsar is documented in https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/22601#issuecomment-2122642708 .
