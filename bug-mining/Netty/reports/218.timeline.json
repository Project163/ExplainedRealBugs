Describe the feature\r\n\r\nAs described in the old issue #2254 the hosts file is only read on start, [this is still true](https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/blob/5d7cc0cc7266ce2db9969821cf8fa3ed78acc0db/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/impl/resolver/DnsResolverProvider.java#L92) and should be fixed in my opinion.\r\n\r\n#### Use cases\r\n\r\nThere are several valid use cases that rely on the hosts file being properly interpreted, if a vertx process needs a restart on every change that is a big drawback.
