The can result in protocol violations that close the channel.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a WebSocket client and server with compression enabled.  Create a WebSocket frame equal to the max frame size that \"compresses\" to a size larger than the input and send it from the client.  Send the frame.  The server will close the connection with a protocol violation.\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL to code)\r\n\r\nPR fixing this, with tests, forthcoming.
