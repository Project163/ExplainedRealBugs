per the current implementation, `BrotliEncoder` compress a `ByteBuf` in a single operation. This approach is good when we have small data set to work with. However, In the case of stream, there are multiple `ByteBuf`, and compressing each `ByteBuf` using the Single-shot method is the wrong approach.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nUse streaming
