\r\n\r\nwhen `io.netty.channel.unix.Socket` is ipv6 and join a multicast group with ipv4 address will cause `io.netty.channel.ChannelException: setsockopt() failed: Invalid argument` (at least in `Linux centos.dev 4.18.0-240.10.1.el8_3.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Jan 18 17:05:51 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`)\r\n\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\ncheck if target group address is ipv6 before call  `io.netty.channel.epoll.LinuxSocket#joinGroup(java.net.InetAddress, java.net.NetworkInterface, java.net.InetAddress)` \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this modification is currect, but i checked source code of java NIO\r\n\r\n```\r\nJava_sun_nio_ch_Net_canJoin6WithIPv4Group0(JNIEnv* env, jclass cl)\r\n{\r\n#if defined(__APPLE__)\r\n    /* IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP can be used to join IPv4 multicast groups */\r\n
