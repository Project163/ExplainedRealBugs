If our server detects it's running out of physical memory, it will just respond with the client requests with something like `Service Unavailable`.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is: We cannot know the free memory of PooledByteBufAllocator efficiently. For example, we have allocated and cached 8GB chunks in a `PooledByteBufAllocator`, but there is no property to know: what exactly the free memory is, 1GB or 8GB?\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThe [PR](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5133/files) in 2016 is similar to what we want and it provides a new property `pooledBytes` to record the free memory of the arena but we want the free memory in the scope of each allocator instance.\r\n\r\nAnd `io.netty.maxDirectMemory` is similar but isn't what we want because it applies the limit to all buffers while we just want to know the free memory size of a PooledByteBufAllocator instance","closed_by":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11637/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
