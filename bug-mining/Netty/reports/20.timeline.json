really want to implement HTTP/0.9 from the era of before 1996, when almost no web browser worked correctly?\r\n\r\nFor example, Chrome removed HTTP/0.9 https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/09/chrome-54-deprecations#http09_deprecated\r\n\r\n> HTTP/0.9 is the predecessor to HTTP/1.x. It lacks many features of its successors. A particular concern for the modern web is its lack of response headers. Without them, there's no way to verify that an HTTP/0.9 response is really an HTTP/0.9 response. This can cause several problems. Examples include, among other problems:\r\n> - Clients that treat certain error responses as valid HTTP/0.9 responses.\r\n> - Servers that fail to close the request socket causing clients to treat responses as a hanging GET which either stays alive eternally or until a user navigates from a page that made the request.\r\n> - Servers that are unable to indicate to the browser that a request failed, which can cause problems with caching heuristics.\r\n\r\n> The only foolproof way to fix issues with HTTP/0.9 is to remove support altogether. Which is why support for HTTP/0.9 is removed in Chrome 54.\r\n\r\nPlease think twice before opening a can of worms.
