[allocateNormal(buf, reqCapacity, normCapacity) ](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/5986c229c463f064e7b787a4547c0689d2302a03/buffer/src/main/java/io/netty/buffer/PoolArena.java#L228), but **allocateNormal** always increase normal's counter at [code1](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/5986c229c463f064e7b787a4547c0689d2302a03/buffer/src/main/java/io/netty/buffer/PoolArena.java#L232) and [code2](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/5986c229c463f064e7b787a4547c0689d2302a03/buffer/src/main/java/io/netty/buffer/PoolArena.java#L239), these two increment action could be replaced by following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void updateAllocationCounter(final int normCapacity) {\r\n        if (isTiny(normCapacity)) {\r\n            allocationsTiny.increment();\r\n        } else if

increment code (tiny / small / normal ) again, thanks @normanmaurer
