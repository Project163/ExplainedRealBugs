`PlatformDependent.maxDirectMemory()` is powerful and general.\r\nIn other project, we want to read the `maxDirectMemory` too. \r\nBut we can't directly use `PlatformDependent.maxDirectMemory()` , because it will wrong if user set `io.netty.maxDirectMemory` greater than zero. \r\nInstead of copy and paste netty's code(Under Apache License), I want a UtilityClass to get `PlatformDependent.maxDirectMemory0` result.\r\n\r\nI am not very familiar with netty code,  I can work on this under guides.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
