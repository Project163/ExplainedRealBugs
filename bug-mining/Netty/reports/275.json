Or at least it returns always false. This may create issues in non-linux operating systems.\r\n\r\nTo give you more context, in my work, like you do, we try to not produce garbage by replacing `HashSet` with something similar to `SelectedSelectionKeySet`. Actually this trick is something we learned from netty.\r\n\r\nSo while investigating a recent bug, I realized lack of correct implementation of `contains()` method creates problems in macos (and very possibly windows as well). I tried to summarize my finding in here: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24267\r\n\r\nI do think this issue effects netty as well.","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
