Incorrect WebSockets closure affects our production system. \r\n- Enforced 'close socket on any protocol violation' prevents our custom termination sequence from execution.\r\n- Huge number of parameters is a nightmare both in usage and in support (decoders configuration).\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\n- Fix violations handling - send proper response codes.\r\n- Fix violations handling - send response into channel (originally it was sent into context).\r\n- Encapsulate decoder's configuration into a separate class.\r\n- Add new decoder's option - send close frame on protocol violation (enabled by default).\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #8295.

Incorrect WebSockets closure affects our production system. \r\n- Enforced 'close socket on any protocol violation' prevents our custom termination sequence from execution.\r\n- Huge number of parameters is a nightmare both in usage and in support (decoders configuration).\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\n- Fix violations handling - send proper response codes.\r\n- Fix for messages leak.\r\n- Introduce decoder's option to disable default behavior (send close frame) on protocol violations.\r\n- Encapsulate WebSocket response codes - `WebSocketCloseStatus`.\r\n- Encapsulate decoder's configuration into a separate class - `WebSocketDecoderConfig`.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #8295. \r\n\r\nNote: previous PR #8308 got stuck - I cannot get any response from reviewers...
