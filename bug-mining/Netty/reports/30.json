is obviously a known issue, but it's worth tracking. It may also be tricky to pull this off while compiling against JDK6; in particular, invoking `SSLEngine#setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector` requires passing a `BiFunction` implementation. I see a few ways of accomplishing this, assuming that calling this method turns out to be necessary:\r\n\r\n1. Take advantage of [JEP 238](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/238) (Multi-Release JAR Files) to compile and link a small amount of code directly against JDK9\r\n2. Use reflection to call `java.lang.invoke.MethodHandleProxies#asInterfaceInstance`\r\n3. Use a library like ASM to manually generate a `BiFunction` implementation at runtime","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6933/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/6933/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
