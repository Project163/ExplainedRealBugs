Usually IllegalArgumentException with message \"promise already done\" or IllegalReferenceCountException.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nThe change ensures that the values for the promise and bytebuf are nulled before calling finishWrap so that it will not be called again with the same arguments.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #9971 .

finishWrap(...) fails\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nWhen SslHandler.finishWrap throws an exception, ensure that the promise and buf is not reused to avoid throwing IllegalArgumentException or IllegalReferenceCountException which causes the original exception to be lost.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nThe change ensures that the values for the promise and bytebuf are nulled before calling finishWrap so that it will not be called again with the same arguments.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes #9971 .\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Norman Maurer
