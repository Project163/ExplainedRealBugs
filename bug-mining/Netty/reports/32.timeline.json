able to upgrade to TLS according to RFC 2817, within HTTP/1.x. \r\nSwitching the transport layer to TLS should be possible without removing `HttpClientCodec` from the pipeline, because HTTP/1.x layer of the protocol remains untouched by the switch. \r\n\r\nModification:\r\nDon't set `HttpObjectDecoder` into `UPGRADED` state if `SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS` response contains `HTTP/1.0` or `HTTP/1.1` in the protocol stack described by the `Upgrade` header.\r\n\r\nDescribe the modifications you've done.\r\nAdded a new method  `isSwitchingToNonHttp1Protocol` and called it from `resetNow`.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nShould fix #7293. \r\nThis is not fully tested yet - just asking if such a fix would be

over TLS\r\n\r\nThis change allows to upgrade a plain HTTP 1.x connection to TLS\r\naccording to RFC 2817. Switching the transport layer to TLS should be\r\npossible without removing HttpClientCodec from the pipeline,\r\nbecause HTTP/1.x layer of the protocol remains untouched by the switch\r\nand the HttpClientCodec state must be retained for proper\r\nhandling the remainder of the response message,\r\nper RFC 2817 requirement in point 3.3:\r\n\r\n  Once the TLS handshake completes successfully, the server MUST\r\n  continue with the response to the original request.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, the upgrade can be established by simply\r\ninserting an SslHandler at the front of the pipeline after receiving\r\n101 SWITCHING PROTOCOLS response, exactly as described in SslHander\r\ndocumentation.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- Don't set HttpObjectDecoder into UPGRADED state if\r\n  101 SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS response contains HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 in\r\n  the protocol stack described by the Upgrade header.\r\n- Skip pairing comparison for 101 SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS, similar\r\n  to 100 CONTINUE, since 101 is not the final response to the original\r\n  request and the final response is expected after TLS handshake.\r\n\r\nFixes
