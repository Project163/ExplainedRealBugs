uses the unguarded recycling which doesn't track it (!).\nWe can get rid of this limit - or let the unguarded recycling to become a full citizen/type instead which:\n1. doesn't need to store release/load acquire per pooled instance state\n2. doesn't need to allocate an additional indirection per pooled object\n\nThis one, plus the changes to be more \"local pooling first\" should be

`unguarded = true` one which shouldn't happen: the latter have less instructions (as expected), but seems to cost more cycles (in proportion). \nI need to go deeper in this, to understand what's going on.\n\nFor reference both the previous commits are double as costly as the local array q + mpsc q one, whilst `4.2` was 4 times worse in my machine.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/3245188022/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"franz1981","id":13125299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981","html_url":"https://github.com/franz1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19459670143,"node_id":"MEE_lADOABA-c87JIf9MzwAAAASH4wB_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/19459670143","actor":{"login":"georgebanasios","id":129333863,"node_id":"U_kgDOB7V6Zw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129333863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios","html_url":"https://github.com/georgebanasios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-02T12:48:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19459670293,"node_id":"SE_lADOABA-c87JIf9MzwAAAASH4wEV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/19459670293","actor":{"login":"georgebanasios","id":129333863,"node_id":"U_kgDOB7V6Zw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129333863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios","html_url":"https://github.com/georgebanasios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-02T12:48:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/3245663154","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15604#issuecomment-3245663154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15604","id":3245663154,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c87BdOOy","user":{"login":"georgebanasios","id":129333863,"node_id":"U_kgDOB7V6Zw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129333863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios","html_url":"https://github.com/georgebanasios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebanasios/received_e
