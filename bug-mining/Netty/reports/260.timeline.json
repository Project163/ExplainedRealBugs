original logic relies on a variable `remainingRounds` and in order to maintain it, all timeouts in the bucket have to be traversed in a tick.\r\nIn fact, the complete traversing of the linked list is not necessary.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nMy idea is to introduce a new variable `currRound` which represent the current round of the timer, and `execRound` for the execution round of each timeout. `currRound` is added by 1 when the tick starts a new round. Then for each timeout, we compare `currRound` and `execRound` to determine if the task should be executed, and break the loop once `currRound` < `execRound`.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nBy this means, we can reduce the number of traversed nodes, and the performance would be especially improved when the node number is large.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12888/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/1327869884","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13018#issuecomment-1327869884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13018","id":1327869884,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABA-c85PJa-8","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-25T20:32:09Z","updated_at":"2022-11-25T20:32:09Z","body":"@chrisvest I investigated the issue and didn't find a behavior change in HashedWheelTimer.
