`JdkZlibEncoder`, the javadoc specifies:\n\n```java\n     * @param compressionLevel\n     *        {@code 1} yields the fastest compression and {@code 9} yields the\n     *        best compression.  {@code 0} means no compression.  The default\n     *        compression level is {@code 6}.\n```\n\nNow this is true in case the overload with no compression level is used:\n\n```java\n    /**\n     * Creates a new zlib encoder with the default compression level ({@code 6})\n     * and the specified wrapper.\n     *\n     * @throws CompressionException if failed to initialize zlib\n     */\n    public JdkZlibEncoder(ZlibWrapper wrapper) {\n        this(wrapper, 6);\n    }\n```\n\nBut if you look into the `java.util.zip.Deflater` that gets created in the constructor, it actually specifies:\n\n```java\n    /**\n     * Default compression level.\n     */\n    public static final int DEFAULT_COMPRESSION = -1;\n```\n\nIs there any reason why the netty default compression level deviates from the underlying Deflater default compression level?","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
