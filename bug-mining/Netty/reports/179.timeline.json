There should probably be a check to disallow those operations if the buffer's ref count is > 1 (as it would be in your case), and I recall some discussion about that a very long time ago.\r\n\r\nDepending on your use case, you could just use `copy()` instead of `retainedSlice()`. Or if the data is very large and you want to avoid copying bytes you could do:\r\n```java\r\nsliced = composite.alloc().compositeBuffer().addFlattenedComponents(true, composite)\r\n```\r\nafter which you can call `discardReadBytes()` on `composite` without it affecting `sliced`'s content. However this only works if `composite` really is a `CompositeByteBuf`.
