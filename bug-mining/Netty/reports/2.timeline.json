Java 7, X509TrustManager implementation is wrapped by a JDK class\ncalled AbstractTrustManagerWrapper, which performs an additional\ncertificate validation for Socket or SSLEngine-backed connections.\n\nThis makes the TrustManager implementations provided by\nInsecureTrustManagerFactory and FingerprintTrustManagerFactory not\ninsecure enough, where their certificate validation fails even when it\nshould pass.\n\nModifications:\n- Add X509TrustManagerWrapper which adapts an X509TrustManager into an\n  X509ExtendedTrustManager\n- Make SimpleTrustManagerFactory wrap an X509TrustManager with\n  X509TrustManagerWrapper is the provided TrustManager does not extend\n  X509ExtendedTrustManager\n\nResult:\n- InsecureTrustManagerFactory and FingerprintTrustManagerFactory are now\n  insecure as expected.\n- Fixes #5910\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5912/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":820497122,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDgyMDQ5NzEyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/820497122","actor":{"login":"trustin","id":173918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzkxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin","html_url":"https://github.com/trustin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"471007ed5538d14f44df3a2758cae1be6facd68c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/471007ed5538d14f44df3a2758cae1be6facd68c","created_at":"2016-10-12T05:41:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":820635873,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDgyMDYzNTg3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/820635873","actor":{"login":"trustin","id":173918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzkxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin","html_url":"https://github.com/trustin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trustin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1888e6764fbaedfa91b1320fa74f4561b611251f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/1888e6764fbaedfa91b1320fa74f4561b611251f","created_at":"2016-10-12T08:27:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":820669987,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDgyMDY2OTk4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/820669987","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ad631a98eb5155b8a26bfe7bbe5f212eab28b324","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/ad631a98eb5155b8a26bfe7bbe5f212eab28b324","created_at":"2016-10-12T08:57:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":820853722,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODIwODUzNzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/820853722","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://
