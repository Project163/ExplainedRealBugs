says...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n10539f4dc738c48e8d63c46b72ca32906d7f40ec is the first bad commit\r\ncommit 10539f4dc738c48e8d63c46b72ca32906d7f40ec\r\nAuthor: Nick Hill <nickhill@us.ibm.com>\r\nDate:   Sat Nov 3 02:37:07 2018 -0700\r\n\r\n    Streamline CompositeByteBuf internals (#8437)\r\n    \r\n    Motivation:\r\n    \r\n    CompositeByteBuf is a powerful and versatile abstraction, allowing for\r\n    manipulation of large data without copying bytes. There is still a\r\n    non-negligible cost to reading/writing however relative to \"singular\"\r\n    ByteBufs, and this can be mostly eliminated with some rework of the\r\n    internals.\r\n    \r\n    My use case is message modification/transformation while zero-copy\r\n    proxying. For example replacing a string within a large message with one\r\n    of a different length\r\n    \r\n    Modifications:\r\n    \r\n    - No longer slice added buffers and unwrap added slices\r\n       - Components store target buf offset relative to position in\r\n    composite buf\r\n       - Less allocations, object footprint, pointer indirection, offset\r\n    arithmetic\r\n    - Use Component[] rather than ArrayList<Component>\r\n       - Avoid pointer indirection and duplicate bounds check, more\r\n    efficient backing array growth\r\n       - Facilitates optimization when doing bulk-inserts - inserting n\r\n    ByteBufs behind m is now O(m + n) instead of O(mn)\r\n    - Avoid unnecessary casting and method call indirection via superclass\r\n    - Eliminate some duplicate range/ref checks via non-checking versions of\r\n    toComponentIndex and findComponent\r\n    - Add simple fast-path for toComponentIndex(0); add racy cache of\r\n    last-accessed Component to findComponent(int)\r\n    - Override forEachByte0(...) and forEachByteDesc0(...) methods\r\n    - Make use of RecyclableArrayList in nioBuffers(int, int) (in line with\r\n    FasterCompositeByteBuf impl)\r\n    - Modify addComponents0(boolean,int,Iterable) to use the Iterable\r\n    directly rather than copy to an array first (and possibly to an\r\n    ArrayList before that)\r\n    - Optimize addComponents0(boolean,int,ByteBuf[],int) to not perform\r\n    repeated array insertions and avoid second loop for offset updates\r\n    - Simplify other logic in various places, in particular the general\r\n    pattern used where a sub-range is iterated over\r\n    - Add benchmarks to demonstrate some improvements\r\n    \r\n    While refactoring I also came across a couple of clear bugs. They are\r\n    fixed in these changes but I will open another PR with unit tests and\r\n    fixes to the current version.\r\n    \r\n    Result:\r\n    \r\n    Much faster creation, manipulation, and access; many fewer allocations\r\n    and smaller footprint. Benchmark results to follow.\r\n\r\n:040000 040000 1cb457424e3c5b6355c17161e9db1b98f38a524b bd4544c4c9901e5b2842afb0312606efa1c90dcb M\tbuffer\r\n:040000 040000

and similar methods produce sliced buffers with an independent refcount to the buffer that they wrap.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the optimizations in 10539f4dc738c48e8d63c46b72ca32906d7f40ec was to use a ref to the unwrapped buffer object for added slices, but this did not take into account the above special case when later releasing.\r\n\r\nThanks to @rkapsi for discovering this via #8495.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nSince a reference to the slice is still kept in the `Component` class, just changed `Component.freeIfNecessary()` to release the slice in preference to the unwrapped buf.\r\n\r\nAlso added a unit test which reproduces the bug.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes
