\"different behavior depending on the implementation\" sounds like a bug or a useless API. It seems especially bad with the methods being encouraged over `order()`. We had assumed \"maybe it is a bug with order()\", but if the API is \"a box of chocolates and you never know what you are going to get\" then that is a more severe issue.\r\n\r\nBut even if there is some variation in implementation, it seems particularly surprising that `writeShortLE` and `getShortLE` disagree with each other; I don't know how to interpret that other than there's a

`*LE` family of accessor methods are documented to always perform accesses in little-endian byte order, regardless of what `ByteBuf.order()` has been set on a buffer.\r\nThis was not always honoured by the `SwappedByteBuf`, and many methods were fixed in #10747, except the get and set methods were missed by that PR.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nFix the methods that were missed in #10747 and make the
