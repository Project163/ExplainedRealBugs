At [this line](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.2.7.Final/buffer/src/main/java/io/netty/buffer/Unpooled.java#L598), the exact length of the UTF-8 representation of the string is calculated via `ByteBufUtil#utf8Bytes`, and the buffer is allocated with the calculated size\n\n2. At [this line](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.2.7.Final/buffer/src/main/java/io/netty/buffer/ByteBufUtil.java#L845) within the subsequent call to `ByteBufUtil#writeUtf8`, the code ensures that the buffer can accomodate `utf8MaxBytes(seqLength)`. In most cases this is larger than the already allocated size, resulting in a re-allocation of a new backing array for the buffer, even though the original array would have been enough for the whole string","closed_by":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
