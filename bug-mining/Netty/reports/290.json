This means, that looking up k8s service names isn't possible without either enabling JNDI, which is not such a great option, or specifying DNS servers manually (oh my).\r\n\r\nNaively, one could instantiate `com.sun.jndi.dns.DnsContextFactory`, but nah - JPMS gets in the way there (which is fine IMO).\r\n\r\nOTOH `sun.net.dns.ResolverConfigurationImpl` doesn't do anything else than reading `/etc/resolv.conf` (at least on Linux + macOS).\r\n\r\nWDYT about adding a fallback to `DirContextUtils` that if the lookup of the DNS servers via JNDI fails, it reads `/etc/resolv.conf` directly? Doesn't feel to be a huge ton of work, can contribute a PR for that.\r\n\r\n/cc @geoand @cescoffier ","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13883/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/13883/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
