the _HttpObjectEncoder.encodeAndClose_ method encodes a response which content is _always empty_ (as described in [_HttpObjectEncoder. isContentAlwaysEmpty](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/main/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty5/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java#L240) ), then the empty last http content or the empty FullHttpResponse is not closed.\r\n\r\nAn http response content is always empty for example when status code is INFORMATIONAL, is a 204, 205, 304 ... [See for example here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/main/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty5/handler/codec/http/HttpResponseEncoder.java#L67)\r\n\r\nExample scenario: \r\n\r\n1) a _DefaultHttpResponse_ is first encoded with status 204, in this case, the _HttpObjectEncoder.encodeAndClose_ method will initialize its state to **ST_CONTENT_ALWAYS_EMPTY**, [see here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/main/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty5/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java#L96).\r\n\r\n2) next, an _EmptyLastHttpContent_ is encoded. So, the _HttpObjectEncoder.encodeAndClose_ state being in _ST_CONTENT_ALWAYS_EMPTY_, then the encodeAndClose method switch statement will proceed [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/main/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty5/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java#L149) directly, which is not closing the _EmptyLastHttpContent_\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nMove the code which was disposing the message [from here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/main/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty5/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java#L144) to the case on ST_CONTENT_ALWAYS_EMPTY [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/main/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty5/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java#L150).\r\nAlso added some test cases in _HttpResponseEncoderTest_.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nDisposing the message to the case on _ST_CONTENT_ALWAYS_EMPTY_ will continue to ensure that the message is closed when the state is _ST_CONTENT_NON_CHUNK_ and when content length is zero (because the case fall-through, [see here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/main/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty5/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java#L145)), and also ensures that any HttpContent is closed when state is _ST_CONTENT_ALWAYS_EMPTY_.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/12828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7681510143,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85P-FOjzwAAAAHJ2or_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/7681510143","actor":{"login":"franz1981","id":13125299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981","html_url":"https://github.com/franz1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aaad7652eb2818884d988edee5941b9b2bc3c4dc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/franz1981/vert.x/commits/aaad7652eb2818884d988edee5941b9b2bc3c4dc","created_at":"2022-10-27T11:48:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"franz1981","id":13125299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981","html_url":"https://github.com/franz1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-27T11:50:12Z","updated_at":"2022-10-27T11:50:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/4520","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/4520/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/4520/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/4520/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/4520","id":1425506404,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAB0q485BqNBY","number":4520,"title":"Save

help.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nChristoph","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatPerf/type-pollution-agent/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatPerf/type-pollution-agent/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7751198138,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85P-FOjzwAAAAHOAeW6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/7751198138","actor":{"login":"vietj","id":225674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj","html_url":"https://github.com/vietj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5ea7bc2fe2cf17ab78b57c5ac68386821bb841b5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/commits/5ea7bc2fe2cf17ab78b57c5ac68386821bb841b5","created_at":"2022-11-07T10:26:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8591340818,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85P-FOjzwAAAAIAFXUS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/8591340818","actor":{"login":"franz1981","id":13125299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981","html_url":"https://github.com/franz1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f09a21dea7bea8b3cc3eb15a7d405b21149209ac","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/franz1981/vert.x/commits/f09a21dea7bea8b3cc3eb15a7d405b21149209ac","created_at":"2023-02-23T12:52:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8624989172,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85P-FOjzwAAAAICFuP0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/8624989172","actor":{"login":"franz1981","id":13125299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981","html_url":"https://github.com/franz1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franz1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dff5858e1b484bb0127d9c7f5fb4d3aaddc14a41","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/franz1981/vert.x/commits/dff5858e1b484bb0127d9c7f5fb4d3aaddc14a41","created_at":"2023-02-28T10:07:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8635965131,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85P-FOjzwAAAAICvl7L","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/8635965131","actor":{"login":"vietj","id":225674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj","html_url":"https://github.com/vietj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vietj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api
