have trouble simulating the blocking call in the unit tests (`NettyBlockHoundIntegrationTest`).\r\n\r\nIn my WebFlux application test suite the blocking call appears when `SingleThreadEventExecutor` is shut down and [sets `terminationFuture`](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/363c4ecc7f2f2ec0d499ceae17c23ada5d0b0765/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/concurrent/SingleThreadEventExecutor.java#L1051). We end up in `GlobalEventExecutor#addTask`, where we make a blocking call on the queue lock. In the tests I tried to set up  `GlobalEventExecutor#addTask` passes without blocking – `tryAcquire` on the queue lock comes `true` and I don't end up in the blocking calls of `acquireQueued`.\r\n\r\nDo you have tips on how to trigger this problem in tests? Here's what I've tried to do:\r\n```\r\n    @Test(timeout = 5000L)\r\n    public void testGlobalEventExecutorAddTask() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(2);\r\n\r\n        SingleThreadEventExecutor executor =\r\n                new SingleThreadEventExecutor(null, new DefaultThreadFactory(\"test\"), true) {\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    protected void run() {\r\n                        while (!confirmShutdown()) {\r\n                            Runnable task = takeTask();\r\n                            if (task != null) {\r\n                                task.run();\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                };\r\n\r\n        executor.execute(() -> {\r\n            latch.countDown();\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        executor.terminationFuture().addListener((FutureListener) future -> latch.countDown());\r\n        executor.shutdownGracefully();\r\n\r\n        latch.await();\r\n    }\r\n```","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/625389431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pbetkier","id":1076252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzYyNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1076252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier","html_url":"https://github.com/pbetkier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbetkier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/625624273","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/10257#issuecomment-625624273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10257","id":625624273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTYyNDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"62mkv","id":5255127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTUxMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5255127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv","html_url":"https://github.com/62mkv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/62mkv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T04:32:10Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T04:32:10Z","body":"hi @pbetkier not sure if this counts as \"in tests\" (in the sense you're asking for), but for us it manifests as follows: \r\n\r\n```\r\n11:05:01.817 [SpringContextShutdownHook] DEBUG kn.internal.pcip.middleware.amqp.AbstractAmqpReceiver - Cancelling subscription for MyIopmFakeProcessor\r\n11:05:01.817 [SpringContextShutdownHook] INFO  reactor.rabbitmq.Receiver - Cancelling consumer amq.ctag-NCAPJpl-MlGRD35bxuuaZw consuming from fake-iopm-queue\r\n11:05:02.156 [SpringContextShutdownHook] ERROR kn.internal.pcip.middleware.config.RabbitmqConfiguration - Error when closing connection to RabbitMQ: connection is already closed due to connection error; cause: java.io.IOException: I/O thread: reached EOF\r\n11:05:02.157 [SpringContextShutdownHook] ERROR kn.internal.pcip.middleware.config.RabbitmqConfiguration - Error when closing connection to RabbitMQ: connection is already closed due to connection error; cause: java.io.IOException: I/O thread: reached EOF\r\n11:05:04.160 [reactor-http-epoll-4] ERROR io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.rejectedExecution - Failed to submit a listener notification task.
