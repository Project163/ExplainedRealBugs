This makes it difficult to integrate\nwith observability systems (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) and monitor how the\nauto-scaling actually behaves at runtime.\n\nProposal:\n- Provide a way to access these metrics programmatically, e.g. via getters on\n  AutoScalingEventExecutorChooser or AutoScalingState.\n- Alternatively, export these metrics via JMX so that monitoring systems\n  (such as Prometheus JMX exporter, Grafana) can easily consume them.\n\nUse case:\n- Export utilization and active thread counts to JMX\n- Visualize them in Grafana dashboards for capacity planning and debugging\n- Verify scaling thresholds and anti-flapping policies in production workloads","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15617/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
