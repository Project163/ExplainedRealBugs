user.\n\nMotivation\n\nI'm looking to harden our SSL impl. a little bit and add some guards agaist certain types of abuse. One can think of invalid hostname strings in the SNI extenstion or invalid SNI handshakes altogether. This will require measuring, velocity tracking and other things.\n\nModifications\n\nAdding a protected `lookup(ctx, hostname)` method that is called from SniHandler's `select(...)` method which users can override and implement custom behaviour. The default implementation will simply call the AsyncMapper.\n\nResult\n\nIt's possible to get a hold onto the ChannelHandlerContext. Users can override that method and do something with it right there or they can delegate it to something else. SniHandler is happy as long as a `Future<SslContext>` is being returned.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5786/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/247501429","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/5787#issuecomment-247501429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5787","id":247501429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzUwMTQyOQ==","user":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjI4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-16T01:59:19Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T01:59:19Z","body":"@rkapsi -

bit.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/247643010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rkapsi","id":191635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTYzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/191635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi","html_url":"https://github.com/rkapsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":792341392,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzkyMzQxMzky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/792341392","actor":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjI4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-16T16:17:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":792341393,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc5MjM0MTM5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/792341393","actor":{"login":"Scottmitch","id":7562868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjI4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7562868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch","html_url":"https://github.com/Scottmitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scottmitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-16T16:17:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":792358265,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc5MjM1ODI2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/792358265","actor":{"login":"rkapsi","id":191635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTYzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/191635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi","html_url":"https://github.com/rkapsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkapsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"88b7ab331935200a435d6ab24acb8d4e6c14be4e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Squarespace/netty/commits/88b7ab331935200a435d6ab24acb8d4e6c14be4e","created_at":"2016-09-16T16:31:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"rkapsi","id":1
