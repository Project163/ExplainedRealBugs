#5933.\n## Motivation:\n\nWhen auto-read is disabled and no reads are issued by a user, `ProxyHandler` will stall the connection on the proxy handshake phase waiting for the first response from a server (that was never read).\n## Modifications:\n\nRead if needed when very first handshake message is send by `ProxyHandler`.\n## Result:\n\nProxy handshake now succeeds no matter if auto-read disabled or enabled. Without the fix, the new test is failing on master.\n\nNotes (on testing):\n\nGiven that `ProxyHandlerTest` is essentially an integration test I decided to slightly extend it and handle its cases with randomized auto-read settings. Basically, we randomly assign an auto-read setting to the channel in the test just to make sure the original test works regardless of what the auto-read value is.\n\nI know, this adds some \"randomness\"  to the test suite, but I think we should be fine here because \n\n a) \"the integration tests\" implies some reasonable level of randomness and\n b) we fully cover the space of generated values (our test is total on the input)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5939/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":841101881,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODQxMTAxODgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/841101881","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"23f033ac08906b8db4dbb5695d6f0701ad14e4d3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/23f033ac08906b8db4dbb5695d6f0701ad14e4d3","created_at":"2016-10-30T07:27:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/257136564","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/5933#issuecomment-257136564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/5933","id":257136564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzEzNjU2NA==","user":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-30T07:28:52Z","updated_at":"2016-10-30T07:28:52Z","body":"Fixed
