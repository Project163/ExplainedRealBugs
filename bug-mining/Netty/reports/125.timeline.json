TLS SNI Extension in HTTP/2 Client request.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nSince \"Http2ClientInitializer\" creates a new SSLContext Handler without specifying Host, Netty does not add SNI Extension in TLS Client Hello request and the request fails if the server uses SNI to establish TLS Connection. \r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nSpecified Host while creating a new SSLContext Handler in \"Http2ClientInitializer\".\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nNetty adds SNI Extension of the Host Specified in new SSLContext Handler and sends it with TLS Client Hello request.\r\n\r\nFixes
