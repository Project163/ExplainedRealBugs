made in #14241 to address #14239 is a breaking change for libraries that depend on any classes from protobuf/marshalling/compression packages of `netty-codec`.\r\n\r\nAs an example, it broke the pipeline we use in ServiceTalk to validate compatibility with the latest Netty 4.2 snapshots: https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/actions/runs/11032862432/job/30646115309\r\n\r\nIf we proceed with this change, the 4.2 release will be much harder to adopt and require intervention (build/dependencies manipulation) from application owners because libraries won't be able to make themselves compatible with both 4.1 and 4.2 netty releases at the same time.\r\n\r\nImho, this change should wait for 5.0.","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/14371/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
