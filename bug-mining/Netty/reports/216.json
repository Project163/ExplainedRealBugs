This reused buffer is neither read-only nor unexpandable, and thus anyone in the pipeline can modify or expand it. As a result, `SslHandler` can sometimes expand it and append stuff to it, causing unexpected data corruption. It'd be nice if this issue is fixed soon and a new release is out given its severity.\r\n\r\nHere's the full analysis from my colleague @alexc-db:\r\n\r\n1. When `Channel.flush()` is called, `SslHandler` starts getting items from the `pendingUnencryptedWrites` queue [1] - it gets entries from the internal `bufAndListenerPairs` and accumulates them in the `toReturn` buffer [2].\r\n2. For the first entry, `toReturn` is `null` and thus `composeFirst` is called. That method by default just returns the reference to the first entry (it’s overridden in `SslHandlerCoalescingBufferQueue` to have special handling for `CompositeByteBuf`, but it’s not relevant to the issue here). The following calls are calling `compose` and pass `toReturn` there.\r\n3. Internally, `compose` calls `attemptCopyToCumulation` which checks if `toReturn` is writable and its capacity can be expanded to write new bytes from the following queued buffers - if it passes checks in [3], `attemptCopyToCumulation` copies bytes from the next entries to the original `toReturn` buffer (as we saw above it can be the first entry), if it does not pass the checks - `SslHandlerCoalescingBufferQueue` calls `copyAndCompose` which creates a new bigger `buf` and copies bytes from `toReturn` and next entry there, making it a new `toReturn`.\r\n4. Given the behavior above - if `flush` is called and `bufAndListenerPairs` has multiple buffers queued where the first entry is writable, had enough capacity for the bytes in the next entries, and shared across multiple threads - two threads will start copying bytes into the same memory addresses which will cause corruption. In our local reproducer that has more dependencies that just Netty, it was `ZERO_CRLF_CRLF_BUF` [4] (`duplicate()` call doesn’t make a copy, just wraps the original direct buffer).\r\nI was able to make tests pass by marking `ZERO_CRLF_CRLF_BUF read-only` [5].\r\n[1] https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.1.68.Final/handler/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslHandler.java#L817\r\n[2] https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.1.68.Final/transport/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/AbstractCoalescingBufferQueue.java#L175\r\n[3] https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.1.68.Final/handler/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslHandler.java#L2326-L2334\r\n[4] https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.1.68.Final/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java#L210\r\n[5]\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java b/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java\r\n--- a/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java (revision 7d34282f9d2ffdd64c91cb4780b09902d9779b92)\r\n+++ b/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpObjectEncoder.java (date 1635112426650)\r\n@@ -50,9 +50,9 @@\r\n     static final int CRLF_SHORT = (CR << 8) | LF;\r\n     private static final int ZERO_CRLF_MEDIUM = ('0' << 16) | CRLF_SHORT;\r\n     private static final byte[] ZERO_CRLF_CRLF = { '0', CR, LF, CR, LF };\r\n-    private static final ByteBuf CRLF_BUF = unreleasableBuffer(directBuffer(2).writeByte(CR).writeByte(LF));\r\n+    private static final ByteBuf CRLF_BUF = unreleasableBuffer(directBuffer(2).writeByte(CR).writeByte(LF).asReadOnly());\r\n     private static final ByteBuf ZERO_CRLF_CRLF_BUF = unreleasableBuffer(directBuffer(ZERO_CRLF_CRLF.length)\r\n-            .writeBytes(ZERO_CRLF_CRLF));\r\n+            .writeBytes(ZERO_CRLF_CRLF).asReadOnly());\r\n     private static final float HEADERS_WEIGHT_NEW = 1 / 5f;\r\n     private static final float HEADERS_WEIGHT_HISTORICAL = 1 - HEADERS_WEIGHT_NEW;\r\n     private static final float TRAILERS_WEIGHT_NEW = HEADERS_WEIGHT_NEW;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\n\r\n4.1.68.Final and 4.1.69.Final and of course possible in older versions.","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11792/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/11792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
