a dependency on the connection is normal and permitted; streams\r\nactually default to depending on the connection. Using a PRIORITY frame\r\nwith a dependency on the connection could reset a previous PRIORITY,\r\nchange the relative weight, or make all streams dependent on one stream.\r\n\r\nThe previous code was disallowing these usages as it considered\r\ndepending on the connection to be a validation failure.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nLoosen validation check to also allow depending on the connection. Fix\r\nerror message when the validation check fails.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nSetting a dependency on connection would be permitted. Fixes #10416\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nCC @mostroverkhov\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/10473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3644979447,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzY0NDk3OTQ0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/3644979447","actor":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-11T20:50:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3644980695,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM2NDQ5ODA2OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/3644980695","actor":{"login":"ejona86","id":2811396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTEzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2811396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86","html_url":"https://github.com/ejona86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejona86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"61b0fa97d7e5fee763e331b536345844640c092e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/61b0fa97d7e5fee763e331b536345844640c092e","created_at":"2020-08-11T20:51:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3645996744,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM2NDU5OTY3NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/3645996744","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"adcffb626021c925746bdb3bfde56974156c3319","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/adcffb626021c925746bdb3bfde56974156c3319","created_at":"2020-08-12T05:08:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
