don't know if it's worth pursuing but I came yesterday across a network appliance that seemed to perform malformed HTTP based health checks against our Netty application.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP requests looked like this `GET /\\r\\n` without the version and [HttpVersion line 63](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpVersion.java#L63) was throwing Exceptions.\r\n\r\nTurns out it's HTTP/0.9 as per [RFC 1945](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt) (see section 3.1)\r\n\r\n> If the protocol version is not specified, the recipient must assume that the message is in the simple HTTP/0.9 format.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n### Minimal yet complete reproducer code (or URL
