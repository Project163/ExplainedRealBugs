is an inconsistency between the order of events in the\r\nStreamChannel implementation in Http2MultiplexCodec and other Channel\r\nimplementations that extend AbstractChannel where channelInactive and\r\nchannelUnregistered events are not performed 'later'. This can cause an\r\nunexected order of events for ChannelHandler implementations that call\r\nChannel.close() in response to some event.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nThe Http2MultiplexCodec.DefaultHttp2StreamChannel.Http2ChannelUnsafe was\r\nmodified to bounce the deregistration and channelInactive events through\r\nthe parent channels EventLoop.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nStream events are now in the proper order.\r\n\r\nFixes
