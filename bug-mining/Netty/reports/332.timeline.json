in some other issue you posted results from the pooled allocator without assertion (I usually run benchmarks using JMH benchmark.jar and assertions are not enabled there) - and I noticed a great variance similar to what I found at #14757 ; can you post there the intermediate running results? 🙏

improved(+15% ~ +45%) after the PR, and its performance numbers become compatible with `adaptiveAllocator` after the PR.\n\nThere might be other jmh-tests need to be re-evaluated. \n\nThis is more like a gentle reminder/discussion rather than an issue, so feel free to close
