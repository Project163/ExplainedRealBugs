Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9564/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5926710038,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85AkI_FzwAAAAFhQmsW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/5926710038","actor":{"login":"10brothers","id":18365648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18365648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers","html_url":"https://github.com/10brothers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10brothers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7f057a865e6283aff1af0160d613d85cb9c6c37c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/10brothers/netty/commits/7f057a865e6283aff1af0160d613d85cb9c6c37c","created_at":"2022-01-20T17:13:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6956557774,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c85AkI_FzwAAAAGepKXO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/6956557774","actor":{"login":"raidyue","id":2962896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI4OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2962896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue","html_url":"https://github.com/raidyue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raidyue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0c82070e141efa8d9e6ef23c8c805c72f7ecdd0f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raidyue/netty/commits/0c82070e141efa8d9e6ef23c8c805c72f7ecdd0f","created_at":"2022-07-08T01:59:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
