Expected result\r\nAccording to the 2014 W3C Recommendation, semicolon is now illegal as a parameter separator in a http URI.\r\n`?foo=bar;baz` means the parameter `foo` will have the value `bar;baz`\r\n\r\nsee https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/forms.html#url-encoded-form-data\r\n(thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3481664/semicolon-as-url-query-separator)\r\n\r\n### Current result\r\nThe URI decoder now supports the obsolete 1999 W3C recommendation\r\n `?foo=bar;baz` is decoded as `?foo=bar & baz=`\r\n\r\n(see QueryStringDecoder.java, line 230 :  `case '&': case ';':` both characters are handled equally)\r\n\r\n### Netty version\r\ntested (through vert.x) on 1.4.19\r\n\r\n### JVM version (e.g. `java -version`)\r\n1.8.0_60\r\n\r\n### OS version (e.g. `uname -a`)\r\nWindows i686-pc Intel\r\n\r\n_Of course this issue is linked to  #3044 and #2896, but as the
