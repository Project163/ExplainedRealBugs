The executor chooser should pluck executors in round-robin, but at the 32-bit overflow boundary, the round-robin sequence was disrupted when the number of executors are not a power of 2.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\n Changed the index counter from a 32-bit to a 64-bit long. The overflow bug is still technically there, but it now takes so long to reach that it will never happen in practice. For example, 2^63 nanoseconds is almost 300 years.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n The round-robin behaviour for all EventExecutorChoosers is now preserved in practice.
