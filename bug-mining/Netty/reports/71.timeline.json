I agree that we shouldn't be sending RST_STREAM if the headers frame fails, I think \"first frame\" may be an over-simplification. At the very least, that would not be true for server-side. It took me hours to convince myself that https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8332 was \"correct.\" This feels like another time-sink.\r\n\r\nMy original plan for the new H2 API was that Netty internals would be intelligent, so it would end up throwing away the RST in cases like this. I'm not against doing that in the framer/connectionhandler/etc. Reasoning for this is that it is the sanest way to avoid sharing state and avoiding races. Technically, a h2childchan could write(Headers), write(RST), flush(). Any of the current \"HPACK failed\" behavior is based on HPACK encoding being synchronous, which is bizarre with Netty's async

right, for a server, a RST is still necessary if the first response headers fail to write.\r\n\r\nSo what is a way forward on this? The `HpackEncoder` throws a synchronous `StreamException` which feels like the right channel to deal with this. The problem is that we can't throw it out of the `FrameWriter.writeHeaders` method and thus it must go in the promise. The `DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder` already attempts to work around this [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/codec-http2/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder.java#L200). Maybe the best long term solution would be to allow the `FrameWriter` to throw `Http2Exception` so we can know if it was synchronous or not and act accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to swallow RST_STREAM messages I think it will be tricky and also prone to races but probably doable. In this case when the `Http2MultiplexCodec` writes its reset in the `close` method, the connection sees the `HttpStream` in a state of `isHeadersSent() == true` and `isHeadersReceived() == fase`so in this case the connection believes the headers have been sent. This can probably be changed by not opening the stream in the `HALF_CLOSED_LOCAL` state and instead transitioning it to that state after the headers have been successfully written. Unfortunately that would happen in that same section of `DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder` code that works around the lack of synchronous exceptions so I think the best would be that we do this in conjunction with the above and just require that we didn't get a synchronous exception. Alternatively, we would need to buffer writes until the flush of the HEADERS completed in order to manage the case of a `StreamChannel` sending an explicit RST_STREAM. Despite this strategies shortcomings, at that point we should swallow this RST_STREAM in the `ConnectionHandler.resetStream` method.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/comments/434770491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bryce-anderson","id":2948506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2948506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson","html_url":"https://github.com/bryce-anderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"bryce-anderson","id":2948506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2948506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson","html_url":"https://github.com/bryce-anderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryce-anderson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T17:50:40Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T17:50:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8471","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8471/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8471/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/8471/events","html_url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8471","id":377962622,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjI4NzgwMDYz","number":8471,"title":"Defer
