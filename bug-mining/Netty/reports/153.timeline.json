If many requests are in the request, many scokets will be occupied(socket). \r\n```shell\r\n[root@app ~]# ss -s\r\nTotal: 61569 (kernel 61731)\r\nTCP:   62328 (estab 49757, closed 9067, orphaned 3, synrecv 0, timewait 235/0), ports 411\r\n\r\nTransport Total     IP        IPv6\r\n*\t  61731     -         -        \r\nRAW\t  0         0         0        \r\nUDP\t  1         1         0        \r\nTCP\t  53261     6         53255    \r\nINET\t  53262     7         53255    \r\nFRAG\t  0         0         0    \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn each channel read implementation, netty creates a new receive buffer to read all inbound data when it enters the read event, in this case if OutOfMemoryError is supposed to release the pipeline read event. Otherwise,  it will be blocked for a certain period of time, causing the server to monitor the alarm. \r\n\r\nIf we find out where to use `RecvByteBufAllocator.java#Handle#allocate`,  and then catch in the catch to add out of the OutOfMemoryError judgment, and then call the release pipeline read event, will it solve the problem?\r\n\r\nI should probably test the 'EpollStreamChannel' KQueueStreamChannel environment to see if it will be the same, but I haven't tried to do it.
