MQTT Decoder fails for connect messages with a password > ~2000 bytes.\nThe decoder works fine in 4.2.1.Final, but fails with the following error when using 4.2.2.Final\n```\nInvalidMessage(CONNECT,io.netty.handler.codec.DecoderException: non-zero remaining payload bytes: -45 (CONNECT))\n```\n\nWhen the password is smaller, the issue does not present itself.\n\nI have debugged the code, and the problem lies in the way the decoder calculates `bytesRemainingInVariablePart`, when decoding the payload.\nIn 4.2.1, this function updates that internal variable at the end of successfully processing the buffer.\nIn 4.2.2, the variable is updated _during_ the processing, which it should not do, because the function fails halfway through, and is retried.\n\nDuring password processing, reading the password from the buffer fails here:\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/660edeaefad4a4cedbd61584e8f668ad2d89f0b8/codec-mqtt/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/mqtt/MqttDecoder.java#L547\n, causing it to return to the old position and retry:\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/660edeaefad4a4cedbd61584e8f668ad2d89f0b8/codec-base/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/ReplayingDecoder.java#L398\n\nThis in turn runs the decodePayload _again_, which _again_ substracts from the `bytesRemainingInVariablePart`, causing it to fail in the validation with the error mentioned above.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
