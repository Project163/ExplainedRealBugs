Client sends a request to an API e.g. http://host/someBasePath/myResource?transactionDetails=shopping;tesco&date=2013-01-01\r\n2. Notice the `;` within 'shopping;tesco'\r\n3. The API internally tries to fetch the query params from the `HttpServerRequest` i.e\r\n   `httpServerRequest.getParam(\"transactionDetails\")`\r\n   Expectation is this would return `shopping;tesco` however it is only returning `shopping` instead\r\n\r\nSemicolons since 2014 from W3C recommendations are now illegal parameter separators and only `&` is allowed.\r\nThere is a fix merged in netty -> https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8855 (see QueryStringDecoder class)\r\n\r\nHowever HttpServerRequest doesn't seem to allow a way to get query params with treating semicolons as normal.\r\n\r\nIt appears this is down to HttpUtils using a constructor of QueryStringDecoder which default to not treating semicolons as normal characters:\r\nhttps://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/blob/1807f72a01c70bb9c189ee232ce635d15be0d726/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/http/impl/HttpUtils.java#L498\r\n\r\nShould the above HttpUtils now use the new constructor of QueryStringDecoder and set semicolons to be treated as normal characters by default from vertx point of view?
