ultimately opens UDP ports for DNS resolution. Callers likely expect that [`RoundRobinDnsAddressResolverGroup#close()`](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/resolver/AddressResolverGroup.html#close--) will close those ports, but that is not currently true (see #9212).\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\nOverrode `RoundRobinInetAddressResolver#close()` to close the delegate name resolver, which in turn closes any UDP ports used for name resolution.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n`RoundRobinDnsAddressResolverGroup#close()` closes UDP ports as expected.

separately).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jchambers/pushy/issues/706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jchambers/pushy/issues/706/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"bsideup","id":1050762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTA3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1050762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup","html_url":"https://github.com/bsideup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T13:15:46Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T13:15:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/793","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-netty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/793/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/793/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/793/events","html_url":"https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/793","id":474043491,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzQwNDM0OTE=","number":793,"title":"UDP
