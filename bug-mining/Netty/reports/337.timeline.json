use currently `4.2.0.RC2` and cannot update to RC3 and RC4.\n\nRC3 has some cryptic error (NPE due to access to `null` parent). RC4 has another issue:\n\n```\nCaused by: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: writerIndex(0) + minWritableBytes(96) exceeds maxCapacity(0): AdaptivePoolingAllocator$AdaptiveByteBuf(ridx: 0, widx: 0, cap: 0/0)\n\tat io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.ensureWritable0(AbstractByteBuf.java:294)\n\tat io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.ensureWritable(AbstractByteBuf.java:280)\n\tat org.jetbrains.intellij.build.io.ZipIndexWriter.writeCentralFileHeader(ZipIndexWriter.kt:30)\n\tat org.jetbrains.intellij.build.io.ZipIndexWriter.writeCentralFileHeader$default(ZipIndexWriter.kt:19)\n\tat org.jetbrains.intellij.build.io.ZipArchiveOutputStream.writeRawEntry(ZipArchiveOutputStream.kt:190)\n\tat org.jetbrains.intellij.build.io.ZipFileWriter.file(ZipFileWriter.kt:164)\n\tat org.jetbra\n```\n\nThe code in https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/build/jvm-rules/zip/src/ZipArchiveOutputStream.kt was not changed for several years already — we allocate `buffer` as a part of class init, and reuse it multiple times, calling `.clear()`.\nupdate: the actual code is https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/build/jvm-rules/zip/src/ZipIndexWriter.kt (we allocate buffer and do not reuse it, call `write` multiple times and then in the end read from it).\n\nNetty is used both as a generic lib (thread is from a coroutine dispatcher) and as an HTTP lib (thread is some Netty's thread).\n\nDo you have any idea what might be causing the regression? I don’t see any incorrect API usage on my end.
