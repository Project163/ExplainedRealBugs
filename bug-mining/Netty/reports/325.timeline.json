BoundedInputStream was recently introduced to protect against attacks where a large file was placed on the server.  Unfortunately, this has an issue preventing it from reading the last bytes of a file where the buffer size would take the total bytes over the set bound, when reading just the remaining bytes in the file fits underneath the set bound.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n\r\nAdjusted the behaviour of BoundedInputStream to, where appropriate, read 1 more byte than the set bound, to see if the file terminates at this point, in which case there is no need to throw the exception\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nFixes
