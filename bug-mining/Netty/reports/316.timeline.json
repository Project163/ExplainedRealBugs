allocation patterns can cause the PooledByteBufAllocator to continuously allocate and deallocate chunks, leading to high memory churn.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nWhen the HeapArena destroys a chunk, it does so while keeping one chunk alive for later reuse. If a chunk is already stowed for reuse, then heap chunks get destroyed like before. When allocating a new chunk, we atomically grab any stowed chunks and set the cache field to null. We assert that the parameters are all the same, which should be the case since they're all derived from the SizeClass.\r\n\r\nWe only do this caching for the heap chunks, because the direct chunks have explicit lifetimes, and it would be too complicated to do this trick for them. This also respects the opposing desire to release native memory back to the OS with expediency, when it's no longer needed.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nWe add a single-chunk cache that acts as a damper for any chunk allocation/deallocation oscillations that might occur with certain allocation patterns.\r\n\r\nThis fixes
