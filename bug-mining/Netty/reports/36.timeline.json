is currently no way to enforce the position of a handler in a ChannelPipeline and assume you wanted to write something like a custom Channel type that acts as a proxy between two other Channels.\r\n\r\nProxyChannel(Channel client, Channel server) {\r\n  client calls write(msg) -> server.write(msg)\r\n  client calls flush() -> server.flush()\r\n  server calls fireChannelRead(msg) -> client.write(msg)\r\n  server calls fireChannelReadComplete() -> client.flush()\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn order to make it work reliably one needs to be able to scoop up the various events at the head and tail of the pipeline. The head side of the pipeline is covered by Unsafe and it's also relatively safe to count on the user to not use the addFirst() method to manipulate the pipeline. The tail side is always at a risk of getting broken because addLast() is the goto method to add handlers.\r\n\r\nModifications\r\n\r\nAdding a few extra methods to DefaultChannelPipeline that expose some of the events that reach the pipeline's TailContext.\r\n\r\nResult\r\n\r\nFixes

to #7484, I have a requirement to provide a Channel implementation for users to add their own handlers to, but I have my own handlers that need to retain their original positions in the overall data

the parent Channel when it reaches the head or tail of the SubChannel. In this way, users can add their handlers to the SubChannel in any way they choose (addLast, addFirst, etc), without the possibility of displacing my own handlers in the parent Channel.\r\n\r\nThis

Netty team,\r\n\r\nStarted to extend the `DefaultChannelPipeline` and found out that it is not possible due to: \r\n- `AbsractChannel` relies on `DefaultChannelPipeline` class rather than `ChannelPipeline` interface\r\n- `DefaultChannelPipeline` is 'effectively final' (all interface methods are implemented as `final`)\r\n\r\nI would suggest either one of the following options: \r\n1. Change `AbstractChannel` to depend on `ChannelPipeline` instead of `DefaultChannelPipeline` (the same as 'Idea 1' in #7484)\r\nI've found just 2 usages of `DefaultChannelPipeline` specific methods: `estimatorHandle()` and `invokeHandlerAddedIfNeeded()` which can be pulled-up to the interface (with maybe slight redesign)\r\n2. Relax `DefaultChannelPipeline` and remove final modifiers\r\n3. At least add pipeline modification callbacks (like handlerAdded/Removed) to the `DefaultChannelPipeline`\r\n\r\nBackground use case: https://github.com/libp2p/jvm-libp2p/issues/39\r\nClosely relates to #7484","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/9505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2700861382,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3MDA4NjEzODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/2700861382","actor":{"login":"maksimkim","id":3820545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA1NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3820545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim","html_url":"https://github.com/maksimkim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maksimkim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bea7d306ea4b1e6543f335c101672a005c2275af","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/maksimkim/DotNetty/commits/bea7d306ea4b1e6543f335c101672a005c2275af","created_at":"2019-10-09T23:57:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
