SOCKS5 protocol, as defined by RFC 1928, reserves authentication method codes from 0x80 to 0xFE for private or experimental use. The current Socks5ProxyHandler in Netty only supports the standard methods: No Authentication (0x00) and GSS-API / Username/Password (0x01/0x02). This limitation prevents users from implementing and utilizing custom authentication schemes with SOCKS5 proxy servers that require private authentication methods.\r\n\r\nThis change addresses this gap by adding support for these private authentication methods, as requested in issue #15460.\r\n\r\n\r\nModification:\r\nIntroduced a new constructor in Socks5ProxyHandler that accepts a byte for the private authentication method and a byte[] for the authentication token/payload.\r\nWhen this new constructor is used, the handler will offer the specified private method to the SOCKS5 proxy during the initial handshake.\r\nIf the proxy selects the private method, the handler proceeds with the private authentication sub-negotiation by sending the provided token.\r\nAdded corresponding tests in ProxyHandlerTest.java to validate the new functionality. This includes creating a test Socks5ProxyServer that supports a private authentication method and adding test cases for successful authentication, authentication failure (bad token), and connection rejection.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nFixes #15460.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement allows users to connect to SOCKS5 proxies that require custom, non-standard authentication, increasing the flexibility and completeness of Netty's proxy support.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/15470/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19128749557,"node_id":"CE_lADOABA-c86_wyIrzwAAAAR0KY31","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/19128749557","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-13T05:45:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19128749562,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABA-c86_wyIrzwAAAAR0KY36","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/issues/events/19128749562","actor":{"login":"normanmaurer","id":439362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer","html_url":"https://github.com/normanmaurer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normanmaurer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"817bab129d0330a4252e6705a13270c27cbf40ed","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netty/netty/commits/817bab129d0330a4252e6705a13270c27cbf40ed","created_at":"2025-08-13T05:45:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
