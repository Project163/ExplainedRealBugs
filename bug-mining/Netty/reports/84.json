Please add the [required substitutions](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos/blob/master/native-netty-plot/src/main/java/com/oracle/svm/nettyplot/NettySubstitutions.java) and [build options](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos/tree/master/native-netty-plot/src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/com.oracle.substratevm/netty-plot) right into Netty as described in the article.
