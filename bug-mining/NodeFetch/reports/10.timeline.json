Perhaps a complimentary module that can interrogate the error to give a more useful sub-type for the given error message?\n- Redirect headers, perhaps a `history` on the response, containing any response objects through a history chain the first entry being the first response then the redirect chain, until the final result.\n  - each entry in history is a response object\n  - entries in history do not have a `history` property, only the final response\n  - the final response is not included in `history`\n  - history will be `undefined` unless there are values (will never be a 0 array)\n    - this will allow a simpler `if (res.history)` kind of check instead of `if (res.history && res.history.length)` ... not really required, but an idea\n\nNote: neither of the above suggestions would require a 2.0 bump as they would be additive... for the history, once implemented, would put forward an issue to chromium/safari/ie/firefox to add the feature and to whatwg to extend the standard.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/comments/84081322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tracker1","id":444316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDMxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/444316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1","html_url":"https://github.com/tracker1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tracker1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/comments/84302064","html_url":"https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/8#issuecomment-84302064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/8","id":84302064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MzAyMDY0","user":{"login":"bitinn","id":1484279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODQyNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1484279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn","html_url":"https://github.com/bitinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-21T10:27:59Z","updated_at":"2015-03-21T10:27:59Z","body":"@tracker1

easier debugging and error handling.\n- `err.headers` for peeking into redirection headers when you are not following redirects.\n\nAs we don't see such needs ourselves (we don't write special case for different errors, so `err.message` is simply a hint for debugging), wonder what else ppl are interested in.\n\nNote: `Error` here refer to Network error, Redirection error or Parser error etc.,
