However, the Fetch Standard says that only a plain UTF-8 decode should be performed, regardless of the actual input encoding. As written in the referenced issue and confirmed by myself, the spec behavior is what's implemented by the browsers.\n> \n> A few options:\n> \n> Keep the current behavior\n> Remove conversion process\n> Use an option (e.g. res.text({ convert: true }))\n> Make a new method (e.g. res.textConverted())\n> I'm leaning towards 4. 1 makes this module incompatible with the browser (something I don't want to do), 2 makes transition to v2 more difficult for people already using this library, and I'm reluctant to modify the behaviors of a well-defined function such as .text().\n> \n>

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n- When i run the code bellow to get content of a japanese website. so the console log will print the text result with some broken character.\r\n\r\n- The problem happened when i call function text (res.text()).\r\n- After look at code of function `async text()`. i saw that the problem is toString function that will convert buffer to string with encoding is `UTF-8`. But the correct encoding in my case is `shift_jis`\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n* Decode response as text\r\n*\r\n* @return  Promise\r\n*/\r\nasync text() {\r\n  const buffer = await consumeBody(this);\r\n  return buffer.toString(); // <= toString function will convert buffer to string with encoding is UTF-8.
