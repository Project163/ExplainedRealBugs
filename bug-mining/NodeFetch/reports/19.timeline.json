In my case the server did a 20 second close. There might be multiple requests to the server over the connection but if 20 seconds have elapsed it closes the connection after the the last http response is sent.I have a default nodejs client configuration ( I haven't assigned it more threads or anything).\r\n\r\nWhen configuring the custom http agent on the client side, i supplied ``{keepAlive: true, maxSockets:50}``.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How often does it reproduce? Is there a required condition?\r\n\r\nWhen the there's a lot of requests being sent constantly things are fine, but if there is a slowdown(not many things do, hence lesser requests to go out) - the next request usually ends up getting an ECONNRESET. \r\n\r\nBased on my TCP dump I have, when there's a good load of requests over the connection pool when the server sends a \r\n[FIN, ACK], the client sends a [FIN,ACK] and the server sends an ACK  back and the connection closes successfully \r\n\r\nBut when there is a \"lull\" later and there's not enough requests over the pool, the server sends a [FIN,ACK] for an unused connection in the pool, the nodejs client responds [ACK] and the next request in the queue goes on this socket causing the server to respond with a RESET. (Rightly so - coz the server wanted to close the connection).\r\n\r\nNow I believe the reason for the next request to go on the socket that just got the FIN has probably has to do with connection choosing strategy. I think the default is both these frameworks is lifo, and the ACK (without the FIN) that gets sent makes the connection go to the top of the pool for the next request. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior? Why is that the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nA socket closed from the server side (FIN,ACK sent by server) must be removed from the connection pool instead of it being kept in there - Regardless of the fact that a FIN wasn't sent back. And no future requests should go on it.\r\n\r\n### What do you see instead?\r\n\r\nThe connection stays in the pool if the FIN wasn't sent back.  The next request goes on the connection. Sever forcibly closes connection with a RESET\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI tried a few other frameworks apart from node-fetch and axios (same issue, making me think it's a node core problem) - But I can't use them in my code so not mentioning them . \r\n\r\nWhen I reduced ``maxSockets`` from 50 to 20 the issue happened less frequently. Which is why i think it is related activity on those sockets.  I switch to the ``keepaliveagent`` package that has a SocketTTL feature - it helps, but doesn't solve the problem . Resets still happen (same issue). Seems like this issue was [reported there](https://github.com/node-modules/agentkeepalive/issues/57) and they tried to handle it there (still a problem though). I'm assuming [this issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/29600) has the same problem I'm facing - they were using ``keepaliveagent`` as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues/47130/reactions","total_count":37,"+1":33,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues/47130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9063135259,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAcd5ZM5j3I1FzwAAAAIcNHgb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/events/9063135259","actor":{"login":"dhedey","id":8008816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDg4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8008816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey","html_url":"https://github.com/dhedey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4098943669fbb3647b251774f1a24c93e903551f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dhedey/node-fetch/commits/4098943669fbb3647b251774f1a24c93e903551f","created_at":"2023-04-21T03:14:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9063176656,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAcd5ZM5j3I1FzwAAAAIcNRnQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/events/9063176656","actor":{"login":"dhedey","id":8008816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDg4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8008816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey","html_url":"https://github.com/dhedey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d49b494b3ebf3ca32109ca410934a04430122359","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dhedey/node-fetch/commits/d49b494b3ebf3ca32109ca410934a04430122359","created_at":"2023-04-21T03:23:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dhedey","id":8008816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDg4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8008816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey","html_url":"https://github.com/dhedey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-21T03:31:16Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T03:31:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1736","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1736/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1736/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1736/events","html_url":"https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/pull/1736","id":1677725845,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAcd5ZM5O0gll","number":1736,"title":"fix:

Purpose\r\nThis fixes #1735 and likely replaces #1473.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nRemoves the behaviour to add a `Connection: close` header. This was causing issues in Node.js 19+ (see #1735), but possibly subtle issues in earlier Node.js too. Note that we still expect some users to use `node-fetch` in Node.js 19+ because enabling fetch requires an `--experimental-fetch` command line parameter passed to Node.js and some users (such as people consuming my library which requires a `fetch` implementation) require it.\r\n\r\nInstead, we rely on the underlying http implementation in Node.js to handle this, as per the documentation at\r\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/http.html#new-agentoptions\r\n\r\nThe [original change introducing this](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/commit/af21ae6c1c964cd40e48e974af56ea2e1361304f) provided no clear motivation for providing the header, and [the implementation has since been changed to disable this header when an agent is provided](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/commit/7f68577de44c7d1efe7009b212f7c54a0b4a709b), so I think there is sufficient evidence that removing this header is the correct behaviour.  \r\n\r\nIf this change is accepted, I'm happy to back-port this into the 2.x branch, as I know some users of my library use 2.x because they can't use ESM.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\nSee  #1735 for background.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n- [X] I updated the readme\r\n(I didn't add unit tests because the behaviour now depends the presence of the header now depends on the default http agent behaviour, and therefore on the Node.js version being used and I didn't want to introduce that dependency into the tests)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n- fix #1735 \r\n- replaces #1473

Description:**\r\n\r\nI would like to raise a concern regarding the current state of the `@clickhouse/client` package. \r\n\r\nIt heavily relies on platform-specific dependencies, including `http`, `zlib`, and `stream`, which limits its usability in certain environments, particularly serverless edge setups. I believe it is crucial to address this issue and propose a solution that would make `@clickhouse/client` more versatile and compatible with a broader range of platforms.\r\n\r\n**Problem Statement:**\r\n\r\nThe presence of node-specific dependencies in `@clickhouse/client` prevents its usage in environments where these dependencies are either unavailable or incompatible. For instance, serverless edge environments require platform-agnostic libraries to ensure seamless execution across different platforms. Unfortunately, the current state of `@clickhouse/client` hinders its potential in such scenarios.\r\n\r\n**Desired Outcome:**\r\n\r\nI kindly request the development team to reconsider the dependencies in `@clickhouse/client` and strive for a solution that eliminates any platform-specific ties. By doing so, we can make the client package more adaptable, enabling it to be used in a wider array of environments, including serverless edge deployments. This change would empower developers to leverage the benefits of the ClickHouse client in scenarios where these platform-specific dependencies are not available or compatible.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nTo address this issue effectively, I propose refactoring `@clickhouse/client` to remove direct dependencies on node-specific packages like `http`, `zlib`, and `stream`. Instead, I recommend employing platform-agnostic alternatives or providing a pluggable interface that allows users to supply their own implementations for the underlying communication layer. Or, `fetch` API could just be used instead, that is supported everywhere nowadays.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n- Enhanced compatibility: Eliminating platform-specific dependencies will broaden the compatibility of `@clickhouse/client`, making it viable for a wider range of platforms and environments.\r\n- Serverless edge deployment: Making the client compatible with serverless edge environments empowers users to harness the advantages of ClickHouse for real-time analytics and data processing in these setups.\r\n- Flexibility: Introducing a pluggable interface for the underlying communication layer will allow users to customize and adapt the client to meet their specific requirements.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n\r\nServerless edge computing has gained significant popularity due to its scalability and reduced infrastructure management overhead. By enabling the usage of `@clickhouse/client` in these environments, we can provide developers with a powerful tool for processing and analyzing data close to the edge, ultimately improving performance and reducing latency.\r\n\r\nI sincerely appreciate your consideration of this proposal.

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nConsecutive HTTP requests cause socket hang up on node v20. This only happens with some servers, so far I could only reproduce this with Lighthouse. This issue causes the [sim tests to fail](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/actions/runs/5575358658/jobs/10185174387#step:8:94) and might cause other issues, e.g. when running Lodestar VC with a Lighthouse BN.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo socket hang up / requests failures\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRunning the following script will cause the first request to pass but the second one fails with socket hang up error\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { getClient } from \"@lodestar/api\";\r\nimport { config } from \"@lodestar/config/default\";\r\n\r\nconst lighthouse = \"http://localhost:5052\"\r\nconst api = getClient({ baseUrl: lighthouse }, { config });\r\n\r\nawait api.beacon.getBlockV2(\"head\");\r\nawait api.beacon.getBlockV2(\"head\");\r\n```\r\n```sh\r\n> node index.js \r\n\r\n/home/nico/projects/test/debug-getStatev2/node_modules/node-fetch/lib/index.js:1505\r\n                        reject(new FetchError(`request to ${request.url} failed, reason: ${err.message}`, 'system', err));\r\n                               ^\r\nFetchError: request to http://localhost:5052/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/head failed, reason: socket hang up\r\n    at ClientRequest.<anonymous> (/home/nico/projects/test/debug-getStatev2/node_modules/node-fetch/lib/index.js:1505:11)\r\n    at ClientRequest.emit (node:events:512:28)\r\n    at Socket.socketOnEnd (node:_http_client:519:9)\r\n    at Socket.emit (node:events:524:35)\r\n    at endReadableNT (node:internal/streams/readable:1378:12)\r\n    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:82:21) {\r\n  type: 'system',\r\n  errno: 'ECONNRESET',\r\n  code: 'ECONNRESET'\r\n}\r\n\r\nNode.js v20.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nYielding to macro queue in-between the two requests does not produce an error\r\n```ts\r\n// ...\r\nawait api.beacon.getBlockV2(\"head\");\r\nsetTimeout(async () => await api.beacon.getBlockV2(\"head\"), 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe issue is already reported upstream\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1735\r\n- https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/47130\r\n\r\nThere are also some [suggested workarounds](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1735) but those can't easily applied in our case since we are using cross-fetch and require browser compatiblity.\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### Lodestar version or commit hash\r\n\r\n6e014217f9df78c0916299d357588a5bbab05d88","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/5765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/5765/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/comments/1638374355","html_url":"https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1735#issuecomment-1638374355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1735","id":1638374355,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAcd5ZM5hp5vT","user":{"login":"damjanned","id":25449925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDQ5OTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25449925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned","html_url":"https://github.com/damjanned","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damjanned/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-17T15:25:48Z","updated_at":"2023-07-17T15:25:48Z","body":"This happens on the native node fetch too.

to make node-fetch sadly unusable in some situations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn other news - this has been merged and released in `3.3.2`, although will need backporting to 2.x as well (in #1765)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/comments/1653342353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dhedey","id":8008816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDg4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8008816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey","html_url":"https://github.com/dhedey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9934216553,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAcd5ZM5j3I1FzwAAAAJQIB1p","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/events/9934216553","actor":{"login":"dhedey","id":8008816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDg4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8008816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey","html_url":"https://github.com/dhedey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhedey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bbeb56fb0a72cd93cf463d8553598b68cb758933","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dhedey/node-fetch/commits/bbeb56fb0a72cd93cf463d8553598b68cb758933","created_at":"2023-07-27T10:37:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
