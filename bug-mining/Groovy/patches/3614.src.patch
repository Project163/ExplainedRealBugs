 However, if your program doesn't rely on dynamic features and that you come from the static world (in particular, from
 a Java mindset), not catching such "errors" at compile time can be surprising. As we have seen in the previous example,
 the compiler cannot be sure this is an error. To make it aware that it is, you have to explicitly instruct the compiler

 When type checking is activated, the compiler performs much more work:
