 It is possible to define static methods in a trait, but it comes with numerous limitations:
 
-* traits with static methods cannot be compiled statically or type checked. All static methods/properties/field are accessed dynamically (it's a limitation from the JVM).
-* the trait is interpreted as a _template_ for the implementing class, which means that each implementing class will get its own static methods/properties/methods. So a
-static member declared on a trait doesn't belong to the `Trait`, but to it's implementing class.

+(the behavior is similar to static methods in Java interfaces for this case).
 
 Let's start with a simple example:
