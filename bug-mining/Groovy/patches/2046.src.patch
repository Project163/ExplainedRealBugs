- * WARNING: This MetaClass uses a thread-bound ThreadLocal instance to store and retrieve properties.
- * In addition properties stored use soft references so they are both bound by the life of the Thread and by the soft
- * references. The implication here is you should NEVER use dynamic properties if you want their values to stick around
- * for long periods because as soon as the JVM is running low on memory or the thread dies they will be garbage collected.
