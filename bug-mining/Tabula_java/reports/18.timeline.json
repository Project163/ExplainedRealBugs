was trying to work on this one, but the problem seem to be in the logic rather than in the code and I don't know the codebase at all.\r\n\r\nLong story short, the issue is that compareTo implementations must be transitive (it should make sense, but see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo(T) if needed).\r\n\r\nThe current implementation, which can be paraphrased as\r\n\r\n> If the two boxes overlap by at least .4, order left-to-right,\r\n> otherwise order top-to-bottom.\r\n\r\nThis is transitive for the \"normal\" case:\r\n<img

into`TestRectangle`).\r\n\r\nI'd very gladly fix this thing myself, but I'm not sure what the ordering of rectangles should be... maybe different criteria will be needed in different situations?\r\n\r\nFor reference, the fact that `Rectangle` implements `Comparable` is used in:\r\n\r\n- `Cell.getText(boolean useLineReturns)`\r\n- `RectangleSpatialIndex.contains(Rectangle r)`\r\n- `RectangleSpatialIndex.intersects(Rectangle r)`\r\n- `SpreadsheetDetectionAlgorithm.detect(Page page)`\r\n- `SpreadsheetExtractionAlgorithm.findSpreadsheetsFromCells(List<? extends Rectangle>
