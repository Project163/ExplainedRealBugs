There are a few options discussed in https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java/issues/75: \n- the `drip` utility \n- the Ruby and R bindings \n- writing your own program that imports tabula-java.\n\nEventually, to answer your question more directly, we do want to create an HTTP API for extracting multiple tables with one Tabula process. (This already exists in the Tabula GUI app, but needs to be separated out.) \n\nI should add this question to our README, because I suspect you're not the only person wanting to know the answer...
