            <title>[PDFBOX-4604] Used type0 for cyrillic, losting font on android</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-4604</link>
                <project id="12310760" key="PDFBOX">PDFBox</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Debugging with &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.mirrors.quenda.co/apache/pdfbox/2.0.16/pdfbox-app-2.0.16.jar&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;pdfbox-app-2.0.16.jar&lt;/a&gt;&#160;created pdf with java api 2.0.12 after click on loaded .ttf as type0 return &lt;b&gt;unlimited&lt;/b&gt; looks like encoding exception, and interface lock&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-wrap&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12975491/12975491_image-2019-07-23-12-03-38-514.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px solid black&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method loading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PDType0Font.load(outPDDocument, readResource(FONT_FILENAME));&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this fonts lost on android device. To work around this error i created pdf with all symbol on google docs, and getting good font type0.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="16891225" author="tilman" created="Tue, 23 Jul 2019 17:21:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;What do you mean with &quot;type0 return unlimited&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;looks like encoding exception&quot; - no, this is an INFO message, no exception. It means that your font doesn&apos;t have proper unicode mappings. This is only important if you want text extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;interface lock&quot; - do you mean that the Android application became unresponsive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because of this fonts lost on android device.&quot; - what is &quot;lost&quot;? Does this mean the fonts are not displayed on Android? If yes, what application did you use to display the PDF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please clarify what role Android plays here. pdfbox-app-2.0.16.jar doesn&apos;t run on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second screenshot you shared is of PDFDebugger. What does it prove? All I can see that the font is not embedded. Which may bring problems if the software used for display isn&apos;t very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please share the file that was created with 2.0.12. (Can you create the PDF with 2.0.16, and what is the result?)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&#160;no, this is an INFO message&quot; - Info message sending infinitely in console, and interface hangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The second screenshot you shared is of PDFDebugger&quot; -&#160;This screenshot was wrong&#160;sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please clarify what role Android plays here&quot; - We generating pdf for all devices, include Android phone. But on Android pdf not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used viewer on Android:&lt;br/&gt;
Google PDF Viewer,&lt;br/&gt;
Driver PDF Viewer,&lt;br/&gt;
Adobe Acrobar&lt;br/&gt;
&#160;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However looking at the font itself with PDFDebugger will still be slow (but less than before).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause for the viewing troubles is that your font CourierNewPSMT (see at &lt;tt&gt;Root/Pages/Kids/&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;0&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;/Resources/Font/F3/DescendantFonts/&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;0&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; with PDFDebugger) is not embedded (I wonder how this is possible - PDFBox always embeds). PDFBox and the Android viewers then try some workarounds and all fail, maybe because the mobile devices doesn&apos;t have the Cyrillic glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adobe Reader for desktop is able to display the file, but text extraction fails for the table contents. Same for PDFBox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From looking at the content streams, I suspect that your PDF was written twice. First the table, then the contents of the table. The second step was incorrectly done. Maybe with another software, maybe it is a new bug, or maybe some person removed the embedded font with brute force.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
