PR introduces a breaking change.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nResolves #637.\r\nRemoves exposure of the `mime` crate in the public library.\r\nThis will allow users to handle the underlying `&str` instead and optionally parse `Content-Type` headers with their library of choice (if desired).\r\nThis also allows `axum` to remove the dependency on `mime` in the future without requiring another breaking change.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n`&str` has replaced `&mime::Mime` as [`axum::extract::multipart::Field::content_type`](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/extract/multipart/struct.Field.html#method.content_type)'s return type\r\n\r\nSearching docs for `mime` shows no results:\r\n```sh\r\n> cd axum/src/docs\r\n> rg mime\r\n> # (no results)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n- [ ] Does this PR need to be against a different branch other than `main` for the `0.5` release?\r\n- [ ] Should there be more tests? I couldn't find a good way to create parameterized tests without adding another dependency or creating a potentially-esoteric macro.\r\n- [ ] Should there be a doc test for `content_type()`? Seems like it'd either be excessive or incomplete.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/642/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5797793357,"node_id":"REFE_lADOFi7l3s5Ak13yzwAAAAFZk05N","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/events/5797793357","actor":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"25ff831a31bab04dfe868ebf1a71179dc8f2d349","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/commits/25ff831a31bab04dfe868ebf1a71179dc8f2d349","created_at":"2021-12-21T09:48:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/comments/998637487","html_url":"https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/issues/637#issuecomment-998637487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/637","id":998637487,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFi7l3s47hf-v","user":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-21T10:00:02Z","updated_at":"2021-12-21T10:00:02Z","body":"Fixed
