(all internal functions returns `Result<T, Error>`)\r\nSimplified `From<Error> for ApiError`\r\n```rust\r\nimpl From<Error> for ApiError {\r\n    fn from(err: Error) -> Self {\r\n        let status = match err {\r\n            ...\r\n            _ => StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,\r\n        };\r\n        let payload = json!({\"message\": err.to_string()});\r\n        (status, Json(payload))\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI'd like understand which header failed to be extracted in simple way like this:\r\n```rust\r\nError::AxumTypedHeaderError(e) => match e.name {\r\n  AUTHORIZATION => StatucCode::UNAUTHORIZED,\r\n  _ => StatucCode::BAD_REQUEST\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nmake fields `name` and `reason` public in struct `TypedHeaderRejection`\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n`extract::typed_header` module is private (but `Reason` enum should be exported)","closed_by":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/316/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
