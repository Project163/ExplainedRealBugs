`form` feature the following error happens:\r\n```\r\n/home/marcel/.cargo/bin/cargo build --color=always --message-format=json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi --package jitsi-openid --bin jitsi-openid\r\n

form::Form;\r\n    |         ^^^^ use of undeclared crate or module `form`\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to previous error\r\n\r\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0432`.\r\nerror: could not compile `axum` due to 2 previous errors\r\nProcess finished with exit code 101\r\n```\r\nThis error does not happen if you activate the `form` feature.\r\n\r\nMy uneducated guess is that the is missing a feature check for the `form` feature:\r\nhttps://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/blob/main/axum/src/lib.rs#L440","closed_by":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/1106/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/1106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
