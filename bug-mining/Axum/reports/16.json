Unfortunately, I found a case in which it still does not work correctly.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\naxum main branch, commit 16ee83a\r\n\r\n### Platform\r\n\r\nDebian Linux 12 (“bookworm”)\r\nLinux feynman 5.15.0-3-amd64 <span>#</span>1 SMP Debian 5.15.15-1 (2022-01-18) x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\nrustc 1.58.1 (db9d1b20b 2022-01-20)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe `content-length` header in the reply to a simple `HEAD` request is set to 0 if the corresponding `GET` request uses `transfer-encoding: chunked`.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun the example program (which uses tower-http v0.2.1):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse axum::{routing::get, Router};\r\nuse tower_http::compression::{predicate::SizeAbove, CompressionLayer};\r\n\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main() {\r\n    let app = Router::new()\r\n        .route(\"/\", get(|| async { \"Hello, World!\" }))\r\n        .layer(CompressionLayer::new().compress_when(SizeAbove::new(0)));\r\n    axum::Server::bind(&\"0.0.0.0:3000\".parse().unwrap())\r\n        .serve(app.into_make_service())\r\n        .await\r\n        .unwrap();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSend a HTTP/1.1 `HEAD` request for /. Set the `accept-encoding` request header to `gzip`. I used the the following command on the Linux command line:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nprintf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\\r\\naccept-encoding: gzip\\r\\n\\r\\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 3000\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Observed behavior\r\n\r\nThe output contains the line:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontent-length: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe output contains no `content-length` header.\r\n\r\nNote the response to the corresponding `GET` request uses chunked transfer encoding. Its headers look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\ncontent-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\r\ncontent-encoding: gzip\r\ntransfer-encoding: chunked\r\ndate: Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:03:44 GMT\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
