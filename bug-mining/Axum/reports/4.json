Rocket even has this as [`Redirect::to`](https://docs.rs/rocket/0.4.10/rocket/response/struct.Redirect.html#method.to) (the other constructors have the same names as the ones in axum).\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nAdd a constructor to `Redirect` for creating a 303 response. I don't care much about the name, `Redirect::to` like in Rocket or `Redirect::see_other` seem like viable options.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nProvide a constructor with a status code parameter. I don't think this is actually a good idea, and it was intentionally left out so far too.","closed_by":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
