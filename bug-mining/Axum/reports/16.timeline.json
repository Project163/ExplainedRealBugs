#747\r\n\r\nThe bug was that applying a middleware to a method router would cause the response to pass through a `RouteFuture` twice and we'd set the `content-length` and strip the response body twice. That happened because `Router::layer` wrapped things in a `Route` then called `MethodRoute::route` which also applied a `Route`.\r\n\r\nSolved it by having `RouteFuture::poll` set a response extension and not alter the response if that is present. Its a little unfortunate to add more overhead here but couldn't think of another solution since `Router` and `MethodRouter` need to be correct and make sense on their own, and needs to support general services that might not handle `HEAD` requests correctly.\r\n\r\nI also removed `RouterFuture` so `Router`'s response is now `RouteFuture<RequestBody, Infallible>`. The additional indirection of `RouterFuture` hasn't proven to be useful so I think its safe to remove.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/755/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6065589031,"node_id":"CE_lADOFi7l3s5DEdztzwAAAAFpiYsn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/events/6065589031","actor":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-14T09:56:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6065589132,"node_id":"REFE_lADOFi7l3s5DEdztzwAAAAFpiYuM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/events/6065589132","actor":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c135436cc97644bb46b6509cf50d85abe49234ac","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/commits/c135436cc97644bb46b6509cf50d85abe49234ac","created_at":"2022-02-14T09:56:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-20T11:49:11Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T11:49:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/1711","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/1711/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/1711/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/1711/events","html_url":"https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/pull/1711","id":1550723097,"node_id":"PR_kwDOFi7l3s5INPFI","number":1711,"title":"Change

changes `Router::nest` to \"flatten\" the routes. By flattening I mean just\r\nmoving the routes from one router to another by calling\r\n`.route(nest_path, nested_endpoint)`. That means there aren't any `Router`s\r\nnested inside each other and instead we just have one flattened `Router` which\r\nperforms better.\r\n\r\nThe main tricky part was fallback inheritance. The main reason we didn't flatten\r\nroutes in 0.6 previously was specifically because of fallback inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe solution I went for here was to make an internal `PathRouter` type. It has\r\nmost routing functions from `Router`, except fallbacks. A `Router` then\r\ncontains two `PathRouter`s: One for the actual routes and another for\r\nfallbacks. Then when you add a fallback to the root router that adds `/` and\r\n`/*` routes to the fallback `PathRouter`. Nesting is then pretty straight\r\nforward: We just nest the routes from each `PathRouter`.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/issues/1624\r\nFixes
