This is something a lot of services in environments I've worked needs.\r\n\r\nI could implement my own router (cue Bender quote), but I think this would be a common enough use case for production services that it would be valuable to have in the standard router.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create a minimal web server that does nothing of importance, but does it while serving up request logs and metrics in a particular format.\r\n\r\nMy sample server exposes two endpoints, `/api/hello/:name` and `/prometheus`. The first just returns `format!(\"Hello, {}!\", name)`, and the second returns application metrics.\r\n\r\nIn this service, I would use the pattern for my logs (currently emitting `tracing::info!` events, probably with the path parameters at separate keys) and in the request metrics (currently using `opentelemetry` and Prometheus)\r\n\r\nCurrently I log and split the metrics on the full path, but doing that with any sort of cardinality on the path parameters won't scale.\r\n\r\nI'm looking to create collapsed metrics like eg.\r\n```\r\nhttp_server_requests_seconds_count{method=\"GET\",status=\"200\",uri=\"/api/hello/:name\"} 4\r\n...\r\n```\r\ninstead of my current\r\n```\r\nhttp_server_requests_seconds_count{method=\"GET\",status=\"200\",uri=\"/api/hello/world\"} 1\r\nhttp_server_requests_seconds_count{method=\"GET\",status=\"200\",uri=\"/api/hello/foo\"} 1\r\nhttp_server_requests_seconds_count{method=\"GET\",status=\"200\",uri=\"/api/hello/bar\"} 1\r\nhttp_server_requests_seconds_count{method=\"GET\",status=\"200\",uri=\"/api/hello/fnord\"} 1\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition I would like the ability to separate a \"404\" that was due to no route matching and a \"404\" due to a particular resource identified by parameters, so I can have metrics (and corresponding logs) like so:\r\n```\r\nhttp_server_requests_seconds_count{method=\"GET\",status=\"404\",uri=\"\"} 1\r\nhttp_server_requests_seconds_count{method=\"GET\",status=\"404\",uri=\"/api/hello/:name\"} 1\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample server source code here: https://github.com/gsson/mini-web-rs/tree/axum-issue-386 (see `meter_layer.rs`)\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to use the matched route pattern as attributes in logs, request metrics and such. The absence of a matched pattern in the case of 404s is similarly useful to distinguish a missed route from a missing resource.\r\n\r\nI guess attaching a public extension to the request/response would do the trick, but I'm still an Axum noob.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tokio-rs/axum/issues/386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
