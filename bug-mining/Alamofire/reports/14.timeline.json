If I notice it again, I will post the stack trace. For this kind of impossible stack trace, could it be a bug with Xcode symbolicating the crash? Or there's some memory corruption going on? If there's some memory corruption and the app was already in an undefined state, then I guess this is not really the fault of Alamofire library.\nI don't see any other similar issue posted. So if you do a logic check and can't find anything, maybe it is some other issue.

The issue is that `mutableState.responseSerializerProcessingFinished` is only set to true once upon request completion and never set back to false, so it does not guard against the case where once a request finishes, client reuses it and appends more response serializers in quick succession. This can potentially trigger `processNextResponseSerializer` more than once at a time, which breaks its serial execution design, causing the 1st serializer to fire twice. Of course, this may not be the actual reason for the crashes at all, but it shows potential problems with `processNextResponseSerializer` usage.\n\n<img width=\"1303\" height=\"418\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de2b65c-faf3-4de5-b163-f09aa2b50018\" />\n\n<img width=\"1210\" height=\"546\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3322ae3-7ed5-499b-9ed1-9d361a051fe4\" />\n\nThe whole request retry logic is quite complex and I tried to wrap my head around it but didn't get very far. I am not sure if there could be any potential concurrency issue there. Of course, if the client implements the request retrier wrong and invokes completion multiple times, it will lead to quite a disaster since `responseSerializerDidComplete(completion:)` will be invoked multiple times. Maybe it could use a safety check too.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/comments/3382018311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LeoTheCatMeow","id":22405614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDA1NjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22405614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow","html_url":"https://github.com/LeoTheCatMeow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20166286166,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAVavk87MQMEgzwAAAASyARtW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/20166286166","actor":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-08T15:07:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20166286199,"node_id":"SE_lADOAVavk87MQMEgzwAAAASyARt3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/20166286199","actor":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-08T15:07:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/comments/3382052367","html_url":"https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3978#issuecomment-3382052367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3978","id":3382052367,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVavk87JlgYP","user":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-08T15:15:25Z","updated_at":"2025-10-08T15:16:30Z","body":"Yes, that behavior is intentional, to support exactly the use case you state: the user tried to append response serializers after processing had already completed. Rather than fail them, we process them immediately. \n\nThis particular crash is caused by the single response serializer of a `DataTask` being called more than once and attempting to resume the continuation both times. There appears to be some path that allows that to happen. I likely just need to tighten up the atomic behavior of the serializer processing, as there's probably some time outside the lock that allows a codepath to execute twice.\n\nA question for @LeoTheCatMeow and @FlickerSoul, are you using multiple response serializers at all, or just one `.serializing...` method that creates the `DataTask` that you can `await`?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/comments/3382052367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20166459282,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAVavk87MQMEgzwAAAASyA7-S","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/20166459282","actor":{"login":"FlickerSoul","id":13360148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzYwMTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13360148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul","html_url":"https://github.com/FlickerSoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-08T15:15:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20166459312,"node_id":"SE_lADOAVavk87MQMEgzwAAAASyA7-w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/20166459312","actor":{"login":"FlickerSoul","id":13360148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzYwMTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13360148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul","html_url":"https://github.com/FlickerSoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlickerSoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-08T15:15:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20166459358,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAVavk87MQMEgzwAAAASyA7_e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/20166459358","actor":{"login":"LeoTheCatMeow","id":22405614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDA1NjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22405614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow","html_url":"https://github.com/LeoTheCatMeow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoTheCatMeow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-08T15:15:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20166459383,"node_
