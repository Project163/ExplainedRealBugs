In other words, there might be cases where the query parameters should contain dictionary data like\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"key\": {\r\n    \"nestedKey\": \"value\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current implementation will always encode such a dictionary as `key[nestedKey]=value` (see [ParameterEncoding.swift, line 197](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Source/ParameterEncoding.swift#L197)), which might not be match the format the API wants it. For example, the API could like the query parameter to be `key.nestedKey=value`.\r\n\r\n## Feature Request\r\n\r\nAdd a possibility to control for the dictionary encoding approach, similar to `ArrayEncoding`. There would be at least options for the current solution (brackets) as well as the dot notation given in the example above.\r\n\r\n## Value to Alamofire\r\n\r\nAs Alamofire provides encoding options for arrays and boolean query values, it makes sense to provide similar support for the dictionary objects. While sending nested dictionary data in query parameters is not that common and the desired functionality can be achieved in one's own code, making Alamofire support multiple formatting options will make developer life easier with respect to these special cases.","closed_by":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3687/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
