[x] I've read, understood, and done my best to follow the [*CONTRIBUTING guidelines](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n## What did you do?\r\n\r\nI am using `URLEncodedFormEncoder` with the option `NilEncoding.dropValue` to encode an object that has optional string properties.\r\n\r\n## What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nAssuming the following struct : \r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct MyStruct: Encodable {\r\n    let p1: String\r\n    let p2: String?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I encode myStruct I expect to get the following query `p1=string&p2=`.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\ndo {\r\n    let myStruct = MyStruct(p1: \"string\", p2: nil)\r\n    let formEncoder = URLEncodedFormEncoder(nilEncoding: .dropValue)\r\n    let query: String = try formEncoder.encode(myStruct)\r\n    print(query) // prints \"p1=string\"\r\n} catch {\r\n    print(error)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What happened instead?\r\n\r\nGot `p1=string`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Alamofire Environment\r\n\r\n**Alamofire Version:** 5.7.1\r\n**Dependency Manager:** Cocoapods 1.12.1\r\n**Xcode Version:** Xcode 14.3.1\r\n**Swift Version:** 5.7\r\n**Platform(s) Running Alamofire:** iOS\r\n**macOS Version Running Xcode:** Ventura 13.3.1\r\n\r\n## Demo Project\r\n\r\nCode above is sufficient to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\nDigging into Alamofire I think the issue might by in `extension _URLEncodedFormEncoder.KeyedContainer: KeyedEncodingContainerProtocol {`.\r\n\r\nIn fact when the encoder found a nil value it seems to prefer using the `encodeIfPresent` method instead of `encodeNil`.\r\n\r\nUsing this rather naive implementation I managed to get my Struct encoded properly :\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nfunc encodeIfPresent(_ value: String?, forKey key: Key) throws {\r\n    if let value {\r\n        try encode(value, forKey: key)\r\n    } else {\r\n        guard let nilValue = nilEncoding.encodeNil() else { return }\r\n        try encode(nilValue, forKey: key)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3778/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
