This is critical for Swift concurrency safety and is required for code to be `@Sendable` in concurrent contexts.\r\n\r\nHere’s the current implementation in the code:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n/// `RequestAdapter` closure definition.\r\npublic typealias AdaptHandler = @Sendable (_ request: URLRequest,\r\n                                           _ session: Session,\r\n                                           _ completion: @escaping (Result<URLRequest, any Error>) -> Void) -> Void\r\n                                           \r\n/// `RequestRetrier` closure definition.\r\npublic typealias RetryHandler = @Sendable (_ request: Request,\r\n                                           _ session: Session,\r\n                                           _ error: any Error,\r\n                                           _ completion: @escaping (RetryResult) -> Void) -> Void\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n/// `RequestAdapter` closure definition.\r\npublic typealias AdaptHandler = @Sendable (_ request: URLRequest,\r\n                                           _ session: Session,\r\n                                           _ completion: @escaping @Sendable (Result<URLRequest, any Error>) -> Void) -> Void\r\n                                           \r\n/// `RequestRetrier` closure definition.\r\npublic typealias RetryHandler = @Sendable (_ request: Request,\r\n                                           _ session: Session,\r\n                                           _ error: any Error,\r\n                                           _ completion: @escaping @Sendable (RetryResult) -> Void) -> Void\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected @Sendable to be added to the completion closures for AdaptHandler and RetryHandler to ensure thread safety when these handlers are used in concurrent environments, like so:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What happened instead?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is missing `@Sendable` conformance in the completion closures, which could lead to potential issues in concurrent Swift code that leverages the concurrency model introduced in recent versions of Swift.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3905/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
