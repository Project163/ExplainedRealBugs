Steps to Reproduce\n\nI am using Alamofire inside a server-side Swift application (based on Vapor, running on Linux).\n\nIn my actor class, I configure Alamofire like this:\n\n```\nprivate let sessionConfiguration: URLSessionConfiguration\nprivate let delegateQueue: DispatchQueue\nprivate let alamofireManager: Alamofire.Session\n\ninit() {\n    sessionConfiguration = URLSessionConfiguration.default\n    sessionConfiguration.httpCookieStorage = cookieStorage\n    managerDelegate = SessionDelegate()\n    delegateQueue = DispatchQueue(label: “alamofire”, qos: .default)\n    alamofireManager = Alamofire.Session(\n        configuration: sessionConfiguration,\n        delegate: managerDelegate,\n        rootQueue: delegateQueue,\n        requestQueue: delegateQueue,\n        serializationQueue: delegateQueue\n        )\n}\n```\n\nI then use Alamofire for typical .request(…) calls in async functions inside Swift actors.\n\nAfter some time running in production under load, the server crashes with the following pattern in the logs:\n\n```\ndispatch_assert_queue_fail\nSessionDelegate.request(for:as:)\nSessionDelegate.urlSession(:task:needNewBodyStream:)\n```\n\nI have upgraded to Alamofire 5.10.2 and made sure to isolate queues and actors, but the crash persists.\n\n⸻\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe server runs stably under load without crashing, and Alamofire safely handles requests in a Linux environment with Swift concurrency.\n\n⸻\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter some runtime (sometimes a week, sometimes less), the server crashes with:\n\n**Illegal instruction at _dispatch_assert_queue_fail**\n\nwith the stack trace consistently pointing to:\n\n```\nSessionDelegate.request(for:as:)\nurlSession(_:task:needNewBodyStream:)\n```\n\n⸻\n\n### Environment\n• Alamofire version: 5.10.2\n• Swift version: 5.9.2 (swiftlang-5.9.2.1.1 clang-1500.1.0.2.5)\n• Vapor framework on Linux\n• Linux distribution: Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy)\n• Deployment: Production server under moderate load\n• Architecture: x86_64\n\n⸻\n\n### Additional Notes\n\nI suspect this may be related to Dispatch + SessionDelegate + async/await + non-sendable closures, as mentioned in closed issues #3919 and #3920, but it seems the problem persists beyond those fixes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/3956/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17782665431,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAVavk86fLxkNzwAAAAQj7fDX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/17782665431","actor":{"login":"prongbang","id":6635954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang","html_url":"https://github.com/prongbang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eec795d25da285defc747c04cde878d330e52a31","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prongbang/Alamofire/commits/eec795d25da285defc747c04cde878d330e52a31","created_at":"2025-05-23T03:48:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
