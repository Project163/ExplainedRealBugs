seen multiple issues here on Github on the 401 status code (when providing bad credentials for example) that are being closed as support questions or as \"works as intended\". While I agree that cancelling the request is somewhat defendable when authentication doesn't work, the fact that you cannot access the response body is inconvenient.\n\nThe HTTP spec suggests that the user agent should be able to use the response body (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-3.1):\n\n> If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user agent SHOULD present the enclosed representation to the user, since it usually contains relevant diagnostic information.\n\nCurrently Alamofire prevents developers from actually accessing this content unless they insert the `Authorization` header manually instead of using the `authenticate` method (at least, that's a workaround I've seen around here but haven't tested myself #1031). For example, a lot of API's return JSON-encoded error messages to present to the user.\n\nAny thoughts?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/comments/206419794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tieleman","id":28905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman","html_url":"https://github.com/tieleman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/comments/206457191","html_url":"https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/1159#issuecomment-206457191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/1159","id":206457191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjQ1NzE5MQ==","user":{"login":"grosch","id":315966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch","html_url":"https://github.com/grosch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grosch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T16:40:54Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T16:40:54Z","body":"I wholeheartedly agree with @tieleman.

think the main culprit and source of confusion here is the fact that the README lists two separate ways to do HTTP Basic Auth (https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire#http-basic-authentication), but it isn't made clear that they will trigger entirely different behaviour:\n- One using `authenticate`, which will cancel your request (and thus trigger a failure) without providing any clues as to why this happened and you cannot access the status code or response body.\n- One using a manual insertion of the `Authorization` header which will trigger a success (that you can turn into a failure using `validate` if you want) which _does_ give you access to the status code and the response body.\n\nNow, the `authenticate` method is obviously more elegant to use, but using it withholds important information from the developer (and `validate` doesn't work on this as you'd expect). This might just be caused by the fact that using `NSURLCredential` triggers this behaviour and Alamofire can do nothing to prevent that, but it should be made clear (and hence I guess this was labelled as a support question) that this difference in behaviour exists.\n\n@cnoon: If it's not a bug report or a feature request, than at least it's a request for better documentation of this (somewhat unexpected) behaviour.

everyone, apologies for closing this out prematurely. Moved through the issue too quickly. Reopening.\n\nAs you have all clearly pointed out, this is certainly worth investigating further to see if there's a better way we can bubble this back to the user. AFN has been working on a solution for when cert or public key pinning evaluation fails, but I'm still a bit weary of such a change. IMO, if we're going to give custom errors for cert or public key pinning failures, we should certainly do the same for other authorization challenge types.\n\nFor anyone that feels strongly, I'd encourage them to first ramp up on the efforts from AFN, just so that you have all the proper context. Then, let's discuss the possible options here in this issue.\n- [AFN Background](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/issues/3165)\n- [AFN Server Trust Error

for reopening. I have reviewed the two linked AFN issues, and while there are some similarities, I do believe that they cater to a different class of problems (cert or key pinning failures). These are typical examples of errors that occur early at the secure transport level, while the issue with 401's (and other HTTP status codes) resides at the application level after the server has attempted to process the request.\n\nThere's also a slight discrepancy between the described behaviour of Alamofire in the docs and what actually happens when you insert the `authenticate` method. The docs state:\n\n> By default, Alamofire treats any completed request to be successful, regardless of the content of the response. Calling validate before a response handler causes an error to be generated if the response had an unacceptable status code or MIME type.\n\nUsing `authenticate` breaks this default (without warning) and renders `validate` unusable. Therefore, it makes sense (to me) to have cert and key failures trigger a failure (because the request is denied before it is even processed on the application server), but have 401's and other faulty status codes trigger a success (as is the default per the docs) and the ability to force that into a failure with `validate`.\n\nIn other words: `authenticate` should simply insert credentials into the request but not change the default behaviour. Pinning certificates that fail validation should of course trigger a failure/cancellation.\n\nDoes that make sense in this context?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/comments/206763131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tieleman","id":28905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman","html_url":"https://github.com/tieleman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tieleman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":619151095,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDYxOTE1MTA5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/619151095","actor":{"login":"0xced","id":51363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced","html_url":"https://github.com/0xced","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b5b7339e169be432980940dab50cb4545fc3d701","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xced/Alamofire/commits/b5b7339e169be432980940dab50cb4545fc3d701","created_at":"2016-04-07T21:23:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"0xced","id":51363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced","html_url":"https://github.com/0xced","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xced/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T21:24:43Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T21:24:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/1164","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/1164/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/1164/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/1164/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/1164","id":146746059,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjU3MDIzMzA=","number":1164,"title":"Requests
