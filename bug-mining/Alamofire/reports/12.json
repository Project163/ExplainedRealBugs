What did you do?\r\n\r\nCall of an asynchronous session request in a Swift concurrency task with content type validation via `DataRequest.validate(contentType:)`.\r\n\r\nCode was compiled in Swift 6 language mode.\r\n(See demo code below)\r\n\r\n## What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nThat the call does not cause a crash and works both when compiled in Swift 6 mode and when compiled with Swift 5.\r\n\r\n## What happened instead?\r\n\r\n`DataRequest.validate(contentType:)` causes a `EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)` crash due to a Swift 6 concurrency assertion failure.\r\n\r\nThe stack trace is:\r\n```\r\nException Type:  EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)\r\nException Codes: 0x0000000000000001, 0x000000018017b0e8\r\nTermination Reason: SIGNAL 5 Trace/BPT trap: 5\r\n\r\nThread 3 Crashed::  Dispatch queue: org.alamofire.session.rootQueue\r\n#0\tin _dispatch_assert_queue_fail ()\r\n#1\tin dispatch_assert_queue ()\r\n#2\tin swift_task_isCurrentExecutorImpl ()\r\n#3\tin implicit closure #1 in closure #1 in ContentViewModel.makeRequest() ()\r\n#4\tin closure #1 in DataRequest.validate<[String]>(contentType:) at Alamofire/Source/Features/Validation.swift:175\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the exact same code compiled with the Swift 5 language mode does not cause a crash.\r\nThe underlying issue seems to be the use of non-sendable closures in the `DataRequest` implementations.\r\n\r\n## Alamofire Environment\r\n\r\n**Alamofire Version:** 5.10.1\r\n**Dependency Manager:** Swift Package Manager\r\n**Xcode Version:** 16.1 (16B40)\r\n**Swift Version:** 6.0.2 (swiftlang-6.0.2.1.2 clang-1600.0.26.4)\r\n**Platform(s) Running Alamofire:** iOS 18.1\r\n**macOS Version Running Xcode:** macOS Sequoia 15.1\r\n\r\n## Demo Project\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n@MainActor\r\nfunc makeRequest() {\r\n    Task {\r\n        let session = Session()\r\n\r\n        let urlRequest = URLRequest(\r\n            url: URL(string: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/refs/heads/master/Documentation/Usage.md\")!\r\n        )\r\n\r\n        do {\r\n            let result = try await session.request(urlRequest)\r\n                .validate(contentType: [\"application/json\"]) // <-- this line causes a crash, removing it resolves the issue\r\n
