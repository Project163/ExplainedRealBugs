put up #3689 to add this encoding to the `URLEncodedFormEncoder`. You can try it on the `feature/keypath-encoding` branch.\r\n\r\nI likely won't be adding this to the `ParameterEncoding` functionality, as `Encodable` types are the preferred way forward. Instead, I'll look into deprecating that functionality and adding an easy way to migrate to an `Encodable` type, likely with some sort of `AnyEncodable` type.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/comments/1432166146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8531419211,"node_id":"CE_lADOAVavk85eKNhFzwAAAAH8gyBL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/8531419211","actor":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-15T23:16:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8531419482,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAVavk85eKNhFzwAAAAH8gyFa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/8531419482","actor":{"login":"jshier","id":51020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier","html_url":"https://github.com/jshier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jshier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e68cfdf9c5aa4e69f675198a3cf8bef72c7cdede","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/commits/e68cfdf9c5aa4e69f675198a3cf8bef72c7cdede","created_at":"2023-02-15T23:16:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17782662808,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAVavk85eKNhFzwAAAAQj7eaY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/events/17782662808","actor":{"login":"prongbang","id":6635954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang","html_url":"https://github.com/prongbang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prongbang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6a19ba6bb43866550af21e11b41d0df0391ffef3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prongbang/Alamofire/commits/6a19ba6bb43866550af21e11b41d0df0391ffef3","cre
