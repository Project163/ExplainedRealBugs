Issue Link :link:\r\n#2682\r\n\r\n### Goals :soccer:\r\nThis PR ensures that all `Request`s finish with a specific error when the owning `Session` is `deinit`d or the underlying `URLSession` is invalidated.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Details :construction:\r\nPreviously, after the Alamofire 5 refactor, `Request`s were no longer properly being finished, due to the separation of the `URLSessionDelegate` implementation from the `Session` itself, which meant the `Session` would be `deinit`d by the time the `SessionStateProvider` could act on the invalidation.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an additional `SessionStateProvider` method, `cancelRequestsForSessionInvalidation(with error: Error?)` and a new `AFError` case, `invalidatedSession(error: Error?)` to properly support the new failure.\r\n\r\n### Testing Details :mag:\r\nA test was added for the invalidation after deinit case. I'm not sure the actual session invalidation case can be tested.
