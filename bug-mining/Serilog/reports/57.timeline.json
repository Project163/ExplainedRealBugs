Anyone have any ideas?\n\n.NET 4.6 introduced `AsyncLocal`, which does not suffer from this problem (it uses `ExecutionContext` rather than `LogicalCallContext` for the state). We already support `AsyncLocal<>` with a build flag; I'm going to create a PR now that adds .NET 4.6 as an explicit target so that it's used instead of this horrendous API.\n\nWhich .NET Framework

Am I correct in guessing that the application you're working on has made a call into another AppDomain at this point, either through remoting directly, or via SQL Server Management Objects?\n\nYes, we use remoting. Are you sure that the problem pops up only in remoting scenarios?\n\n> Using a subclass of ObjectHandle that returns a custom ILease from InitializeLifetimeService() should fix this, as you suggest...\n\nAh, one more thing: a custom wrapper class or ObjectHandle descendant will need Serilog assembly in the target AppDomain to be deserialized. What if Serilog is not deployed there?\n\n> figuring out how to keep the lease alive long enough without leaking the object entirely will need some thought. Anyone have any ideas?\n\nIf you're OK with custom wrapper class, then I'd suggest infinite lease time + explicit disconnection via RemotingServices.Disconnect, something like this:\n\n```\n// The original idea is by Nathan Evans, I believe\npublic class DisposableMarshalByRefObject : MarshalByRefObject, IDisposable\n{\n    public sealed override object InitializeLifetimeService()\n    {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    private bool Disposed { get; set; }\n\n    public void Dispose()\n    {\n        if (!Disposed)\n        {\n            Disposed = true;\n            RemotingServices.Disconnect(this);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo now it's a question of where and when the wrapper should be disposed of. Perhaps it's when the stack of enrichers goes empty?\n\n> Which .NET Framework version are you running\n\nI'm running .NET 4.6 so using AsyncLocal is not a problem. But I'm a bit confused about ExecutionContext...

Are you sure that the problem pops up only in remoting scenarios?\n\nI believe the problematic `ObjectHandle` lease only starts after a cross-appdomain call. All 2.0+ builds include this code, so the situations in which it becomes an issue must be fairly limited or we'd be flooded with reports by now (see more info further below).\n\n> Ah, one more thing: a custom wrapper class or ObjectHandle descendant will need Serilog assembly in the target AppDomain to be deserialized. What if Serilog is not deployed there?\n\nOnly if the target appdomain uses Serilog's `LogContex`, otherwise the `ObjectHandle` is never `Unwrap()`ped.\n\n> If you're OK with custom wrapper class, then I'd suggest infinite lease time + explicit disconnection via RemotingServices.Disconnect, something like this:\n\nThe copying behaviour of `LogicalCallContext` will make it hard for one single thread, that might be emptying the `LogContext`, to be sure that the `ObjectHandle` isn't still active on another logical thread. Or at least, I'd be cautious asserting anything about when the `ObjectHandle` can be disposed, because there are so many potential (mis-)usage patterns, and this API is a pain to work with.\n\n> I'm running .NET 4.6 so using AsyncLocal is not a problem. But I'm a bit confused about ExecutionContext... I believe it includes logical call context as a part of it, doesn't it?\n\n`ExecutionContext` is there in 4.5 but the members supporting `AsyncLocal` aren't (AFAICT).\n\nI'll merge the 4.6 fix now and

@yallie guys, I would appreciate if you describe me what happened, because I don't understand really. In my understanding, ObjectHandle can't be disposed in primary domain as it is stored in LCC. The exception looks like someone from _secondary_ domain attempted to use LogContext. I do remember  that in one of the versions I tried to give a random slot name, so no one from other domains than primary will be able to unwrap ObjectHandle because it won't work anyway, unfortunately I've decided that it is not necessary. I'm talking about this line:\n\n`static readonly string DataSlotName = typeof(LogContext).FullName;`\n\nTo summarize my understanding: the attempt to use LogContext was made from secondary AppDomain.
