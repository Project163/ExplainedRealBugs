it's nice, but most sinks aren't publicly exposed (`FileSink` and the rolling file are, but most others are hidden behind their configuration methods). Functionally I think it'd still suffer the same self-log-inception issue, since the sinks can write to `SelfLog` even in non-exceptional circumstances.\n\nUsing `TextWriter` also gets around the complexity of binding message templates, destructuring with _its_ various failure modes, etc. etc. etc. :-)\n\n@natiki I fear there's not much chance we can get it \"in the box\". You can plug a `TextWriter` into `SelfLog` today that writes its text payloads to UDP, which might be an interesting option to explore.
