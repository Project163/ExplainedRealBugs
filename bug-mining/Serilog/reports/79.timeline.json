What's new in 3.0.0?\r\n\r\n**Target framework changes** - Serilog no longer targets `netstandard1.x` or .NET Framework versions earlier than .NET 4.6.2. Users on affected frameworks should continue to target Serilog 2.12.x.\r\n\r\n**Removed obsolete APIs** - Many deprecated/obsolete types and functions have been removed. Notably, `JsonFormatter` can no longer be subclassed (either port to `JsonValueFormatter`, use _Serilog.Expressions_, or copy [the original `JsonFormatter` code](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/4d13be50c03e14b6072043799dc7e5dbe4139a19/src/Serilog/Formatting/Json/JsonFormatter.cs) into your project).\r\n\r\n**Added APIs** - `LevelAlias.Off` is now provided as an equivalent to _Microsoft.Extensions.Logging_'s `LogLevel.Off`; `Destructure.AsDictionary<T>()` can now be used to mark dictionary types.\r\n\r\n**Fewer allocations on many hot paths** - A lot of work has gone into avoiding heap allocations wherever possible.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Change exception message by @sungam3r in https://github.com/serilog/serilog/pull/1762\r\n* Avoided
