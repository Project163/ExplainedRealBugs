This occurs with 2.11.0.\r\n\r\n[PropertyEnricher.cs](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/697a23189e3068bfe0da1460a2676913239d2757/src/Serilog/Core/Enrichers/PropertyEnricher.cs#L15) had `#nullable enable` added to it, but `value` and `_value` were not changed from `object` to `object?`.\r\n\r\nThe documentation tells us that it is not an exception to pass `null` for `value`, only `name`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/697a23189e3068bfe0da1460a2676913239d2757/src/Serilog/Core/Enrichers/PropertyEnricher.cs#L40-L41\r\n\r\nUltimately `_value` is used with `propertyFactory.CreateProperty(_name, _value, _destructureObjects);` which seems to tolerate `null` values:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/e1cdad57d96dc1d5eb2c1077a2d918965e82488d/src/Serilog/Capturing/PropertyValueConverter.cs#L94\r\n\r\nUpgrading Serilog causes compile errors were there previously were none.","closed_by":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
