The following code looks suspicious:\n  public void Dispose()\n        {\n            lock (_syncRoot)\n            {\n                if (_currentFile == null) return;\n                CloseFile();\n                _isDisposed = true;\n            }\n        }\n\n```\n    void CloseFile()\n    {\n        _currentFile.Dispose();\n        _currentFile = null;\n        _nextCheckpoint = null;\n    }\n```\n\nDispose checks _currentFile for null, but Dispose is called from CloseFile through _currentFile, which may be null! And it is not theoretical possibility - I really see that happening from time to time, I just never had time to figure exact repro scenario. \n\nThe fix should be trivial though.\nKonstantin\n","closed_by":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
