wrote the JSON formatter for sinks like Mongo and Couch, but now that it can be used with regular files as well, we need to provide a way to delimit the JSON documents written to the file.\n\nNewlines work very well for this (JSON well-formedness is hard to achieve, and splitting on newlines is easy when processing events).\n\nMy first thought is to add this behaviour by default to the formatter, and allow it to be switched off by the \"pure JSON\" sinks. This would be a binary breaking change however.\n\nAlternatively we can provide a decorator for text formatters that does the delimiting, or a new encapsulation of the JSON sink that provides this feature.\n\nVia #105\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/39725404","html_url":"https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/105#issuecomment-39725404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/105","id":39725404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzI1NDA0","user":{"login":"christophdebaene","id":642207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/642207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene","html_url":"https://github.com/christophdebaene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-07T12:49:02Z","updated_at":"2014-04-07T12:49:02Z","body":"It may be interesting that next to `MessageTemplate` also the `Message` property is added with the placeholders filled in? \nThis way you don't have to implement anything yourself and you simply reuse the effort that is done in [Structured Data](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Structured-Data). \n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/39725404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"christophdebaene","id":642207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/642207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene","html_url":"https://github.com/christophdebaene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christophdebaene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
