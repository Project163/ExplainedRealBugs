sense.  The scenario is that I have a number of libraries that are fairly general purpose.  In all of these libraries (and most of my software) mutable global variables are strictly avoided to promote composability, race-free operation, etc.  Strictly speaking, all capabilities are passed down when needed including logging.\r\n\r\nSome of the consumers of these libraries are using logging.  If logging is in use, then there is some value in passing a logger to the libraries so they can log their actions (or even do Debug or Verbose/Trace logging).  However, if logging is not in use by the consumer it is onerous to have to pass a logger to the class.  Now the class can easily specify the capability as optional, however, in implementing the class I don't want this flexibility to either complicate the code or negatively impact performance.  The easiest way to prevent this is to ensure that the m_logger field is never-null (and usually readonly).  Now the reasoning about the existence of a logger is confined to the constructor.\r\n\r\nAssigning the m_logger to an immutable static implementation (effectively a compile-time constant) is nearly free in most runtime environments (and can be truly zero-cost in the presence of tracing JIT or Whole Program Optimization).  This makes the pattern suitable for both class and struct implementations without having any impact on the allocation profile.  E.g.\r\n\r\n````csharp\r\n   for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {\r\n      MyStruct s = new MyStruct(logger: null)\r\n      ...\r\n   }\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis loop silently, implicitly makes 10000 allocations.  If it is easy, I'd like to avoid this.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/366087614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"invino4","id":11217472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjE3NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11217472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4","html_url":"https://github.com/invino4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invino4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/366118249","html_url":"https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/1105#issuecomment-366118249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1105","id":366118249,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjExODI0OQ==","user":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-16T01:23:53Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T01:23:53Z","body":"> Assigning the m_logger to an immutable static implementation (effectively a compile-time constant) is nearly free in most runtime environments\r\n\r\nIt should be easy just to create your own `static readonly ILogger NoLogger = new SilentLogger()` to get going, but having a `Logger.None` on the Serilog side does also sound nice.

issue does this PR address?**\r\nAdds a static `Log.None` property as per the discussion in #1105 \r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\r\n- [X] The commit follows our [guidelines](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [X] Unit Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n**Other information**:\r\nBasic change to stash a `SilentLogger` instance in a private static variable on the `Log` class. That instance is used as the initial value of the `Logger` property.  The same instance is then exposed via the `None` property. `CloseAndFlush()` was modified to reset back to this instance rather than creating yet another `SilentLogger` instance.\r\n\r\nComments were updated where appropriate and code style was preserved.\r\n\r\nI've added tests to ensure that the `None` property is initialised properly.  I've also ensured via a test that initialisation of the `Logger` property doesn't affect the `None` property. \r\nFinally I've ensured that `CloseAndFlush` doesn't corrupt the logger stored and accessible via the `None` property by checking that it remains a `SilentLogger` instance and that we can invoke it without raising an exception.\r\n\r\nI think there are lines of words here than lines of code changed in the PR.  All tests (on my machine) seem to pass in the various framework versions.\r\n\r\nThanks 💯

issue does this PR address?**\r\nAddresses issue #1105.  Replaces PR #1108 \r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\r\n- [X] The commit follows our [guidelines](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [X] Unit Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n**Other information**:\r\nSorry for the new PR.  Given the changes in the old PR were in the completely wrong file, it seemed easier to just close that PR and open a new one.\r\n\r\nIssue #1105 asked for an easy way to get at a constant instance of a `SilentLogger`. The original PR added this on the `Log` class and slightly adjusted that class' internals to make use of this instance.\r\nThis new PR instead modifies the `Logger` class to add a static `Logger.None` property that returns the same `SilentLogger`.\r\n\r\nOne new allocation overall.  I suspect we can live with that (?).  Former PR didn't have that issue.  A lazy init sounds like overkill for this but I'm happy to be told I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nOnly one new unit test - verifying that the property is a silent logger.  There's not a lot of machinery or moving parts to verify anymore compared with the earlier PR.\r\n\r\nFeedback most welcome.

relates to the Serilog core, this repository\r\n\r\n**Does this issue relate to a new *feature* or an existing *bug*?**\r\nIt is debatable if this is a new feature or an existing bug. It is also framework independent.\r\n\r\n**What version of Serilog is affected?  Please list the related NuGet package.**\r\nVersions from Fixes #1105 up until the current dev as of now https://github.com/serilog/serilog/commit/fcd0c8bb128a853b48869dd7821b3e8661963319\r\n\r\n**Please describe the current behavior?**\r\nThe SilentLogger instance of Log.Logger is not the same reference as Logger.None, thus it is impossible to determine if Log.Logger has been initialized or not.\r\n\r\n**Please describe the expected behavior?**\r\nIf Log.Logger has not been initialized, it should be set to the same instance as Logger.None, so Object.ReferenceEquals(Log.Logger, Logger.None) returns a boolean that identifies, whether Log.Logger is uninitialized or closed.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce the issue and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**\r\nTo reproduce, test whether at program start Object.ReferenceEquals(Log.Logger, Logger.None) returns true or false. It should return true until Log.Logger has been assigned a newly created logger. It should also return true when Log.CloseAndFlush() has been called.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround for this is to initialize Log.Logger = Logger.None at program start and whenever after I used Log.CloseAndFlush()","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11359242372,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAH0Zb84RvLUNzwAAAAKlEEiE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/11359242372","actor":{"login":"Twinki14","id":5809130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDkxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5809130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14","html_url":"https://github.com/Twinki14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a92b4734560ad8204315e92601b122cdf379bed6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Twinki14/CitizenFX.Extensions.Client.Serilog/commits/a92b4734560ad8204315e92601b122cdf379bed6","created_at":"2023-12-30T02:21:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
