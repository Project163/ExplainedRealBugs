few questions before you begin:**\r\n\r\n> Is this an issue related to the Serilog core project or one of the [sinks](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Provided-Sinks) or [community projects](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Community-Projects).  This issue list is intended for Serilog core issues. If this issue relates to a sink or related project, please log on the related repository.  Please use [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/serilog/serilog) and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/serilog)  for discussions and questons.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Does this issue relate to a new *feature* or an existing *bug*?**\r\n- [x] Bug\r\n- [ ] New Feature\r\n\r\n**What version of Serilog is affected?  Please list the related NuGet package.**\r\n\r\nSerilog, version 2.6.0\r\n\r\n**What is the target framework and operating system? See [target frameworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/target-frameworks) & [net standard matrix](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard).**\r\n\r\n- [ ] netCore 2.0\r\n- [ ] netCore 1.0\r\n- [x] 4.7\r\n- [ ] 4.6.x\r\n- [ ] 4.5.x\r\n\r\n**Please describe the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have configured Serilog with the LogContext enricher. When capturing a log entry that combines properties provided explicitly (from call site) with properties from the log context I get an unexpected behavior:\r\n\r\nIf the message template references an explicit property after a property from the log context, the properties are not correctly matched. This is perhaps best described by an example\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar logger = new LoggerConfiguration()\r\n    .Enrich.FromLogContext()\r\n    .WriteTo.Debug()\r\n    .CreateLogger();\r\n\r\nusing (LogContext.PushProperty(\"propOne\", \"valueOne\"))\r\n{\r\n    logger.Information(\"propOne has value {propOne}\"); // (1)\r\n    logger.Information(\"propTwo has value {propTwo}, propOne has value {propOne}\", \"valueTwo\"); // (2)\r\n    logger.Information(\"propOne has value {propOne} propTwo has value {propTwo}\", \"valueTwo\");  // (3)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_(1)_ works as expected, it captures _propOne has value valueOne_\r\n\r\n_(2)_ works, that is it captures _propTwo has value valueTwo, propOne has value valueOne_. However, the self logger outputs _Named property count does not match parameter count: propTwo has value {propTwo}, propOne has value {propOne}_\r\n\r\n_(3)_ is unsuccessfully captured: _propOne has value valueTwo propTwo has value {propTwo}_ and the self logger outputs _Named property count does not match parameter count: propOne has value {propOne} propTwo has value {propTwo}_\r\n\r\n**Please describe the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect _(2)_ and _(3)_ to succeed without any output to the self log.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce the issue and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**\r\n\r\nSee above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11359242336,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAH0Zb84KLjuTzwAAAAKlEEhg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/11359242336","actor":{"login":"Twinki14","id":5809130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDkxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5809130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14","html_url":"https://github.com/Twinki14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"42bddf355937216696ad2adc0fccfb69a9b86a52","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Twinki14/CitizenFX.Extensions.Client.Serilog/commits/42bddf355937216696ad2adc0fccfb69a9b86a52","created_at":"2023-12-30T02:21:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16645823787,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAH0Zb84KLjuTzwAAAAPgKx0r","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/16645823787","actor":{"login":"jjschlesinger","id":49366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger","html_url":"https://github.com/jjschlesinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjschlesinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"643dfa4f380ea6babf63586cd9737bcac85bdac4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jjschlesinger/serilog/commits/643dfa4f380ea6babf63586cd9737bcac85bdac4","created_at":"2025-03-09T19:54:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
