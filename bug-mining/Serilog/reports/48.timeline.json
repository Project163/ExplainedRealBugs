Extensibility of `JsonFormatter` has been a challenge for some time.\n\nI think `WriteLiteral()` could change as this class evolves; would a method like:\n\n``` csharp\nprotected void AddWriter(Type type, Action<object, TextWriter> write)\n{\n    _literalWriters[type] = (v, q, w) => write(v, w);\n}\n```\n\nbe another option?
