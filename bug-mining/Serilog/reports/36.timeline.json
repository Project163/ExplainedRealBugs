Your change #289 dramatically supersedes what I proposed here and I really like the direction it is heading. Can you include the option proposed above to your change? Same effect may be achieved by overloading JsonFormatter, but it is so much easier to use built-in JsonFormatter attribute.

PR brings the default behaviour of the elasticsearch sink in sync with serilog's conservative choice to favor ToString()'ing unknown objects over desctructering them (such as exceptions).\n- Sink now uses a subclass of `JsonFormatter`, instead of forcing the data into our own local LogEvent and relying on `ElasticSearchPropertyFormatter` to flatten serilogs data structures. We now hook into serilogs own serialization routine.\n- Had to add some hooks so that the subclass could override property names.\n- If you provide the elasticsearch sink with an `IElasticsearchSerializer` instead of ToString()-ing unknown objects the sink will serialize them as json objects allowing events to be filtered/aggregated more granular.\n- This allows you to optionally take a dependency on `Elasticsearch.Net.JsonNET` and take advantage of the full power of JsonNET.\n- Added unit tests for the elasticsearch sink.\n- Added an .editorconfig file to force files to use an indentation of 4 spaces\n- The events were always written to an index formatted DateTime.UtcNow, but the event timestamp should be leading what index the event has to go into.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/289/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":203871023,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwMzg3MTAyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/203871023","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d4e33acc81d08212d6046ade9b2f6db13cd1be87","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/commits/d4e33acc81d08212d6046ade9b2f6db13cd1be87","created_at":"2014-12-07T22:16:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-07T22:16:59Z","updated_at":"2014-12-07T22:16:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/324","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/324/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/324/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/324/events","html_url":"https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/324","id":51167303,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MTE2NzMwMw==","number":324,"title":"ElasticsearchSink:
