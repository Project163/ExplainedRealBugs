replaces the old `Profile259` with `dotnet5.1`, which is the way forward.\n\n`dotnet5.1` is the lowest System.Runtime-based TFM, roughly equivalent to `Profile259`, and should support everything back to WP Silverlight 8.0. See the [Standard Platform document](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/50c66ffcf62be7683a756df14a2dbc75720ae263/Documentation/project-docs/standard-platform.md#mapping-the-net-platform-standard-to-platforms) for more details. BTW, `dotnet5.1` will be `netstandard1.0` (there's an off-by-one error) and that's what it's called in the document.\n\nI also (mostly) moved away from #ifdef'ing on platform and moved to features instead. I think this makes it clearer why things are #ifdef'ed and what should be moved to separate packages. It would be really nice if Serilog core would just be `dotnet5.1` only. The difference is mostly `System.Diagnostics.Process` and `System.IO.FileSystem`, which aren't available until `dotnet5.4`. There's also the whole `AppDomain`/`Timer` stuff in the `PeriodicBatchingSink` :disappointed: \n\nThis should also unlock the following on the `Profile259` platforms:\n- `DiagnosticTraceSink`\n- `ConsoleSink`\n- `ColoredConsoleSink`\n- `ThreadIdEnricher`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jonorossi","id":126297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjI5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi","html_url":"https://github.com/jonorossi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-08T03:25:54Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T03:25:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/castleproject/Core/issues/124","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/castleproject/Core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/castleproject/Core/issues/124/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/castleproject/Core/issues/124/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/castleproject/Core/issues/124/events","html_url":"https://github.com/castleproject/Core/issues/124","id":124824264,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMjQ4MjQyNjQ=","number":124,"title":".NET
