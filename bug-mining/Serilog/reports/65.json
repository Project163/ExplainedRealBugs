This means the only way to notice the failure is by a human checking inside the build logs.\r\n\r\n**Please describe the expected behavior?**\r\nWhen any part of the [`build.sh`](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/1d8cebf03f41046cd237af22be65df4a357eba7e/build.sh) process fails, the failure should be _fatal_ and reported via a non-zero exit code, so that the tooling understands it failed. I think this is expected because [that appears to be how `build.ps1` works](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/1d8cebf03f41046cd237af22be65df4a357eba7e/Build.ps1#L33).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"merbla","id":637298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzI5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/637298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla","html_url":"https://github.com/merbla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
