was playing around with Serilog and tried creating a custom WCF behavior to log any requests as they come through the pipe line to RavenDb. The IClientChannel object seems to be logged fine to both RavenDb and a file. The Message object is logged to the file, but not to RavenDb and trying to log the InstanceContext object always throws an exception. What am I doing wrong here? The code below illustrates what I mean\n\n```\npublic object AfterReceiveRequest(ref System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message request, System.ServiceModel.IClientChannel channel, System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext instanceContext)\n{\n    seriLogLogger.Information(\"Recieved Request {@channel}\", channel); // Just this line works fine with both RavenDb and a log file..\n    seriLogLogger.Information(\"Recieved Request {@request}\", request); // This line doesn't seem to log anything to RavenDb, but logs to file.\n    seriLogLogger.Information(\"Recieved instancecontext {@instanceContext}\", instanceContext); // This line always throws an exception.\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/75/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/75/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
