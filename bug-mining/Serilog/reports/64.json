Being able to instantiate a SilentLogger makes this cheap.  \r\n\r\nIs there a better pattern with Serilog for accomplishing this?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1105/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
