issue is almost identical to #855\r\n\r\nIf you provide an IFormatProvider to a sink which is capable of rendering the LogLevel property, it is not used. See https://gist.github.com/optical/77e4e53158a683d6faa91076821b4739 for an example which I would expect to work.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell this is because LogEvents end up as LogEventLevelValue's rather than ScalarValue. It looks like there are some custom rules around format strings which this copes with, however it never utilises the supplied formatProvider.\r\n\r\nI suspect the correct behaviour of this method should be to delegate to the formatProvider if the formatProvider is able to return a non-null, ICustomFormatter. Otherwise the method would then fallback to its existing approach. \r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11359242317,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAH0Zb84Kd2TmzwAAAAKlEEhN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/11359242317","actor":{"login":"Twinki14","id":5809130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDkxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5809130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14","html_url":"https://github.com/Twinki14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b8334aa4910ad7f9fab0623c9e0caf5cb9279140","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Twinki14/CitizenFX.Extensions.Client.Serilog/commits/b8334aa4910ad7f9fab0623c9e0caf5cb9279140","created_at":"2023-12-30T02:21:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
