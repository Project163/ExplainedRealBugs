However if you are deploying to a web  environment you more often than not do not have access to the console or a the physical file system to look at a text log file.\n\nIt would be great if there was an option to send this information out by UDP. Ultimately this means zero physical configuration on the destination host aside from say a firewall rule change (a firewall rule change is easier to effect in these scenarios then say getting write permission to a folder within a web root for instance). The UDP listener can be placed anywhere were the packets would reach it.\n\nConfiguration for SeriLog UDP Debug would be as follows:\n1. Broadcast Port\n2. Broadcast to local LAN segment OR Send to specific IP address (Naturally this has to be on the same LAN segment as UDP cannot traverse firewalls by itself)\n\nPS. I could use this functionality right now, because things all work on my local dev environment, but not on the remote web host and you guessed it I cannot get to the console, file system etc. :-)\n","closed_by":{"login":"merbla","id":637298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzI5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/637298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla","html_url":"https://github.com/merbla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merbla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/731/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
