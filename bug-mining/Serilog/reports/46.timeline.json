this outright with a flag and exception on repeated calls looks to be quite easy. However, if the primary issue here is multiple disposal of sinks, I wonder if there isn't a way to fix the problem without relying on \"only call once\" semantics. After looking at the code, I can think of two possible ways to address this besides throwing:\n- Make the `LoggerSinkConfiguration` store delegates for constructing the sinks instead of actual sink instances. Then when `CreateLogger()` is called, spin up a new instance of each sink for each logger. Of course, this would drastically change the semantics of `LoggerSinkConfiguration` and would require sinks have the ability to store their configuration separate from an instance so that the delegate wouldn't get too messy. There may be other problems with the approach of having multiple sinks that do the same thing (file lock contention, etc.)\n- The sinks could \"reference count\" their attached loggers and only dispose when there are no more loggers left. I like this approach better because it doesn't require changing the public API. However, there's an issue of what should happen if you dispose the first logger out (thus not disposing the sinks) but then never dispose the second/last one? The caller would have to make sure to dispose all loggers to trigger sink disposal (which may not be a big deal if they're interested in disposal in the first place).\n\nThoughts?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/153898689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"daveaglick","id":1020407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1020407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick","html_url":"https://github.com/daveaglick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/154760776","html_url":"https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/561#issuecomment-154760776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/561","id":154760776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDc2MDc3Ng==","user":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-07T22:44:31Z","updated_at":"2015-11-07T22:44:31Z","body":"Thanks

well...)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/154760776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":458012098,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU4MDEyMDk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/458012098","actor":{"login":"daveaglick","id":1020407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1020407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick","html_url":"https://github.com/daveaglick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-07T22:44:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":458012099,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1ODAxMjA5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/458012099","actor":{"login":"daveaglick","id":1020407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1020407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick","html_url":"https://github.com/daveaglick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-07T22:44:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/154764998","html_url":"https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/561#issuecomment-154764998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/561","id":154764998,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDc2NDk5OA==","user":{"login":"daveaglick","id":1020407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1020407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick","html_url":"https://github.com/daveaglick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveaglick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-

Sounds like @IanYates has more background than I do here.\n\nA few thoughts and obsevations though:\n\n``` csharp\n            var config = new LoggerConfiguration()\n                .MinimumLevel.Debug()\n                .WriteTo.TextWriter(output);\n\n            var factory = new SerilogFactory(config);\n```\n\nHaving `SerilogFactory` accept a `LoggerConfiguration` is a bit of a risky proposition. Things will go awry, for example, if the configuration includes something like `WriteTo.File()` where at most one configuration can use the specified file.\n\nIf instead, `SerilogFactory` accepted an `ILogger`, customised loggers for various contexts can be created from it:\n\n``` csharp\nvar componentA = log.ForContext(\"Component\", \"A\");\ncomponentA.Information(\"Hello from A!\");\n\n//

merged the PR to Castle Core contributed by @ruba1987 quite a long time ago without much knowledge of Serilog, I've made a few bug fixes since the initial PR, but I don't think many people are using it, if it needs to change that's not a problem.\n\n@IanYates no problem with being a breaking change, we are upgrading to Serilog 2.0 for v4 and we can push the new factory out in Castle Core v4. Happy to see a PR for this in the next few weeks, I've created https://github.com/castleproject/Core/issues/142 to make sure we get this fixed for v4.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/190035265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jonorossi","id":126297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjI5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi","html_url":"https://github.com/jonorossi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonorossi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":570435618,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTcwNDM1NjE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/570435618","actor":{"login":"ruba1987","id":5730503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzA1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5730503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987","html_url":"https://github.com/ruba1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-29T04:43:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":570435619,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU3MDQzNTYxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/570435619","actor":{"login":"ruba1987","id":5730503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzA1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5730503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987","html_url":"https://github.com/ruba1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruba1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-29T04:43:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":570435620,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTcwNDM1NjIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/570435620","actor":{"login":"IanYates","id":1314477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTQ0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1314477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates","html_url":"https://github.com/IanYates","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanYates/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-29T04:43:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
