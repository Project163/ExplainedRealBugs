Thanks for digging in, much appreciated.\n\nThe idea of the current behavior was to run until the queue was [drained](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/master/src/Serilog.FullNetFx/Sinks/PeriodicBatching/PeriodicBatchingSink.cs#L148), however I see the flaw in this under load that you're pointing out :)\n\nPerhaps a better (logical) loop condition would be:\n\n``` csharp\nwhile (last batch was full)\n```\n\nI think much better batching/buffering/throttling behaviour is possible, I'm keen to make what seems like the least disruptive change to address this if what's above sounds like the correct fix to you. Open to any other suggestions.\n\nCheers,\nNick\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/64137066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":197891656,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5Nzg5MTY1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/197891656","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"37849a488e441169194df9f8feff4372a15ca726","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/commits/37849a488e441169194df9f8feff4372a15ca726","created_at":"2014-11-24T21:40:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":197893209,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk3ODkzMjA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/197893209","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"37849a488e441169194df9f8feff4372a15ca726","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/commits/37849a488e441169194df9f8feff4372a15ca726","created_at":"2014-11-24T21:42:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":207183074,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwNzE4MzA3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/207183074","actor":{"login":"mivano","id":668535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODUzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/668535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano","html_url":"https://github.com/mivano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivano/received_ev

have a system using Serilog with the ElasticSearch sink, generating a big volume of logs (~45 million log entries / 24h) and sometimes at high frequency. The problem is that sometimes I get an OutOfMemory exception when I use the ElasticSearch sink; if I use the File sink, for instance, there's no problem. I don't have a clear repro from the code in my system, but I have observed it usually happens when there's a high frequency of logs being created.\n\nI've been able to replicate the issue by tweaking the Serilog.PerformanceTests to use the ElasticSearch sink and more iterations:\n\n```\nstatic void Main()\n{\n    const int iterations = 10000000;\n    var log = new LoggerConfiguration()\n            .WriteTo.ElasticSearch(node: new Uri(\"http://localhost:9200\"))\n            .CreateLogger();\n\n    for (var i = 0; i < iterations; i++)\n    {\n        log.Information(\"Running iteration {I:00.0} for {@J}!\", i, new { Goal = \"Speed\" });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt throws the OutOfMemory exception for me a bit over the 7000000 one. It works fine with the File sink.\n\nIs there any configuration of the ElasticSearch sink that I'm missing and could use to handle this scenario (high volume/frequency)? Is there any documented \"ceiling\" for how much the sink can take? Or is it just a bug/improvement needed in the code?\n\nRight now I have to default to enabling both the ElasticSearch and File sinks (the latter just for error & up) just to make sure I don't miss anything... which is quite annoying! Hopefully there'll be a fix for this :)\n\nThanks a lot\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
