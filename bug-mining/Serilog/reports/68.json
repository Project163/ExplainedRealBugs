It is also framework independent.\r\n\r\n**What version of Serilog is affected?  Please list the related NuGet package.**\r\nVersions from Fixes #1105 up until the current dev as of now https://github.com/serilog/serilog/commit/fcd0c8bb128a853b48869dd7821b3e8661963319\r\n\r\n**Please describe the current behavior?**\r\nThe SilentLogger instance of Log.Logger is not the same reference as Logger.None, thus it is impossible to determine if Log.Logger has been initialized or not.\r\n\r\n**Please describe the expected behavior?**\r\nIf Log.Logger has not been initialized, it should be set to the same instance as Logger.None, so Object.ReferenceEquals(Log.Logger, Logger.None) returns a boolean that identifies, whether Log.Logger is uninitialized or closed.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce the issue and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**\r\nTo reproduce, test whether at program start Object.ReferenceEquals(Log.Logger, Logger.None) returns true or false. It should return true until Log.Logger has been assigned a newly created logger. It should also return true when Log.CloseAndFlush() has been called.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround for this is to initialize Log.Logger = Logger.None at program start and whenever after I used Log.CloseAndFlush()","closed_by":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
