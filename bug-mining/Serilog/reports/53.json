See, for example: https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/issues/437\n\nThe `MinimumLevel.Override()` method will allow useful information to be pulled from the framework, without a deluge of events related to ASP.NET plumbing.\n### Alternatives\n\nThe current `.Filter.By...` API covers the same scenario, but it implements dynamic filtering that's geared towards filtering individual events. Since it relies on the events being created in the first place, it's not as efficient as a per-logger level setting could be. (It's also in need of a refresh, being a bit too flexible for pleasant ergonomics...)\n### Details\n- Would we also provide an `Override()` method accepting a dictionary from string to level?\n- Will loggers only respect this when `ForContext()` is called with a type or string, or will we check the property name against `\"SourceContext\"` even when the name/value overload of `ForContext()` is called? (My preference is for the more limited version, since it'll incur less of a performance impact)\n- Can the second argument (the level) alternatively be a `LoggingLevelSwitch`? (Probably better to build the internals around LLS, since it'll eventually be desirable..)\n- Is it obvious enough in the example above that the pipeline's default level remains at `Information`?\n- Should we go further than the context name/namespace matching logic that we currently maintain for filtering, e.g. to support `\"MyApp.*.Something\"` as a context name?\n- `<appSettings>` syntax? `Config.json` syntax?\n","closed_by":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/754/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/754/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
