are you using, on what platform?\r\n\r\n.net 7 c#\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n\r\nwhen I cut the \"output\" string variable in half and try to log it, it works. So I think this has to do with the length or content of what I'm logging, which I believe should not cause any errors, but it is.
