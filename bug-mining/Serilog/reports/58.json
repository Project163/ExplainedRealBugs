The enum I am trying to render differently is not a type I have control of. You can see my attempt here: [gist](https://gist.github.com/optical/8d7e74780bc6c75b68beb42e45a2a673)\n\nI've followed the principles of implementing IFormatProvider, ICustomerFormatter as I think they should be, but it appears Serilog doesn't attempt to use the FormatProvider for formatting enums.\n\nI believe this comes down to the fact that Serilog only uses the format provider when rendering Scalars, if the underlying type implements IFormattable. [Ref](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/dev/src/Serilog/Events/ScalarValue.cs#L74)\n\nIs what I am trying to do possible?\n","closed_by":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/855/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
