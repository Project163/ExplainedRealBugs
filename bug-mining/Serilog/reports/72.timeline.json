issue does this PR address?**\r\nThis will solve the feature request #1455- To add support C# 8 nullable reference types in Serilog. And this PR includes the #1452 that is _still not merged_ (Working in this feature help find 2 new bugs in Serilog #1426 and #1451).\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nNo. But this is a big change in the codebase.\r\n\r\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\r\n- [ x ] The commit follows our [guidelines](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [ x ] Unit Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- **xunit** still does not support nullable reference types, and because of that, I had to use a [bang operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-forgiving) in the Test project. When xunit adds supports the bang operator could be removed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11359242396,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAH0Zb84kVEVLzwAAAAKlEEic","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/11359242396","actor":{"login":"Twinki14","id":5809130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDkxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5809130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14","html_url":"https://github.com/Twinki14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f405d31c6c752ba22c9872e914700e6a66963cd4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Twinki14/CitizenFX.Extensions.Client.Serilog/commits/f405d31c6c752ba22c9872e914700e6a66963cd4","created_at":"2023-12-30T02:21:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
