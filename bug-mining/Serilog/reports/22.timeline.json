... but first some more detail on what's causing the problem. The object it's trying to decode is a `BsonValue` from MongoDB. On it there are two indexed properties: `.Item[int32]` and `.Item[string]`. Accessing the `.Item` property using `GetValue` isn't going to work for these properties, not without supplying an index.\n\nThe fix is probably to first call `GetIndexParameters` to determine if the property is indexed and only if it is not, should the `GetValue` method be called.\n\nA `try...catch` for the other possible exceptions listed here
