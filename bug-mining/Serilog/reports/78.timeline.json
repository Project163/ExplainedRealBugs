@57r480 @nblumhardt.\r\n\r\nI have checked the function `ConstructPositionalProperties` in `PropertyBinder`, and it seems that there is a simple way to solve this situation. In this function, the variable `result` records the relations between the placeholders and the log objects, which are not repeated. Therefore, the comparison can be modified to the length of `result` and the length of log objects, and placed after the construction of `result` (Line 89).\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this solution is that there is no need to add additional logic, so it has little impact on performance. The disadvantage is that it may change the outputs of `SelfLog` in some cases, for example.\r\n```csharp\r\nlog.Information(\"{0}{1}\", \"hello\");\r\n```\r\nSerilog (v2.9.0) firstly outputs \"Positional property count does not match parameter count\" then outputs \"Unassigned positional value...\", while this solution outputs \"Unassigned positional value...\". \r\n\r\nSince it has a breaking change, I don't know whether it is acceptable.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/665757256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"iskcal","id":11767514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzY3NTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11767514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal","html_url":"https://github.com/iskcal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iskcal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3599786407,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU5OTc4NjQwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/3599786407","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-29T16:10:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3599786410,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1OTk3ODY0MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/3599786410","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-29T16:10:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3599786415,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU5OTc4NjQxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/3599786415","actor":{"login":"57r480","id":68589326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTg5MzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68589326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480","html_url":"https://github.com/57r480","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/57r480/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-29T16:10:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3599786419,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1OTk3ODY0MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/eve

What's new in 3.0.0?\r\n\r\n**Target framework changes** - Serilog no longer targets `netstandard1.x` or .NET Framework versions earlier than .NET 4.6.2.

Notably, `JsonFormatter` can no longer be subclassed (either port to `JsonValueFormatter`, use _Serilog.Expressions_, or copy [the original `JsonFormatter` code](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/4d13be50c03e14b6072043799dc7e5dbe4139a19/src/Serilog/Formatting/Json/JsonFormatter.cs) into your project).\r\n\r\n**Added APIs** - `LevelAlias.Off` is now provided as an equivalent to _Microsoft.Extensions.Logging_'s `LogLevel.Off`; `Destructure.AsDictionary<T>()` can now be used to mark dictionary types.\r\n\r\n**Fewer allocations on many hot paths** - A lot of work has gone into avoiding heap allocations wherever possible.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Change exception message by @sungam3r in https://github.com/serilog/serilog/pull/1762\r\n* Avoided
