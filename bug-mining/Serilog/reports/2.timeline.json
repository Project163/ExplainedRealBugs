occurred to me that in conjunction with implementing transform support, designating types as literals would also be useful (i.e. so that `Guid` and friends could be specified as literals by the user).\n\nOne gotcha also to think about -\n\nWhen composing multiple independent modules/assemblies that share a logger, it may be problematic that what one module considers a literal, the other intends to be destructured. Making mapping/the destructuring strategy global, while message template parameters are provided in isolation by modules, could be a challenge.\n\nOne way around this might be to have one global \"blessed strategy\" that is baked into `LoggerConfiguration`, but to allow transformations/additional literal types to be configured on a context-by-context basis, i.e. for a local logger.\n\nTrade-offs either way - funny how many subtleties there are.\n\nCheers!\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/15712139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/15770238","html_url":"https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/15#issuecomment-15770238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/15","id":15770238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzcwMjM4","user":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-02T11:39:30Z","updated_at":"2013-04-02T11:39:30Z","body":"Made some progress on this.
