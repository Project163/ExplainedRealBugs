for weighing in guys! I've had to think about this one a bit; the original choice of `InvariantCulture` everywhere was an attempt to side-step some of the ugly realities of culture-sensitive formatting, so in this regard I'm actually gravitating back towards @SimonCropp's suggestion, though the format I'd choose would be more like `2014-05-27 22:15:29` - @khellang less ambiguous because `yyyy-` generally appears first in \"sortable\" formats, where the two-digit month and 24-hr time are needed.\n\nUsing a fixed format string only covers the console output scenario, but then, we already accept an explicit `IFormatProvider` to address the issue of formatting data within the log messages themselves.\n\nSo perhaps, if it sounds logical to everyone else we change this
