Using the JsonFormatter or a Formatter that uses the JsonValueFormatter internally like CompactJsonFormatter or RenderedCompactJsonFormatter.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction**\r\nLog using stringification operator with a instance of a class that can return null in ToString(). With configured to use JsonFormatter or CompactJsonFormatter or RenderedCompactJsonFormatter.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\tLog.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()\r\n\t\t.WriteTo.Console(new Serilog.Formatting.Json.JsonFormatter()) //Or other JsonFormatter\r\n\t\t.CreateLogger();\r\n\r\n        class ABadBehavior\r\n        {\r\n            public override string ToString() => null;\r\n        }\r\n        Log.Information(\"{$Data}\", new ABadBehavior());\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThat the Serilog Core doesn't throw an exception. And Log the result like was another null property.\r\n\r\n**Relevant package, tooling and runtime versions**\r\nAll runtimes and using the lastest Serilog codebase.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI find this issue when implementing the C#8 Nullable Reference Type in Serilog codebase. \r\nRelated Issue #1426","closed_by":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1451/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
