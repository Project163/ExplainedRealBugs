there a straightforward way to change the logger configuration (or sink configuration) at runtime?\n\nI generally set up my main logger with a rolling file sink to print out critical errors (especially at startup) as this works in most scenarios. Independently of what type of application I have (service, website, console), I only need to ensure the file system is write-able and I'm good to go.\n\n```\n// dummy\nvar logfilepath = GetLogFilePath(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly());\nLog.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()\n                        .WriteTo.RollingFile(logfilepath)\n                        .CreateLogger();\nLog.Debug(\"It works!\");\n```\n\nHowever, I also would like to log into other sources that are more prone to fail at startup (e.g. databases when wrong connection strings are given). So what I would like to achieve is the following:\n1. Set up a simple, stable logging sink for first startup\n2. Set up e.g. database, log everything related to it\n3. If e.g. database is up and running, add database sink to serilog.\n\nThe only way I see to accomplish this is:\n1. Create a logger configuration\n2. Do stuff\n3. Create a new logger configuration and overwrite the existing one.\n\nDummy code:\n\n```\nvar logfilepath = GetLogFilePath(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly());\nLog.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()\n                        .WriteTo.RollingFile(logfilepath)\n                        .CreateLogger();\nLog.Debug(\"It works!\");\n\nLog.Debug(\"Setting up database with {ConnectionString}\", connectionString);\n\nLog.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()\n                            .WriteTo.RollingFile(logfilepath)\n                            .WriteTo.SomeDatabaseSink(connectionString)\n                            .CreateLogger();\n```\n\nIs there a cleaner, more straightforward approach to change the logger configuration other than overwriting it completely?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/485/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/130566487","html_url":"https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/505#issuecomment-130566487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/505","id":130566487,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDU2NjQ4Nw==","user":{"login":"caseymarcallen","id":951165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MTE2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/951165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen","html_url":"https://github.com/caseymarcallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-13T07:42:57Z","updated_at":"2015-08-13T07:42:57Z","body":"@nblumhardt We are looking at the Serilog.Sinks.Seq sink and have modified it to accept a `LoggingLevelSwitch` instead of a `LogEventLevel` so the min level that is returned from the HTTP call to the Seq server can be exposed to the rest of the application rather than being hidden inside the internal `_minimumAcceptedLevel` variable. \n\nOur specific use case is that we are exposing a route in our MVC website so that web clients can log from javascript. We then use the website and the Seq Sink to forward this information on to the internal Seq Server. We do however want to expose that min level back to the javascript so that they only post the log events over the network back to the server if the level is greater than the min level as configured by the Seq Server API Key. Hence we want access to that `mininumAcceptedLevel` value that the sink if using.\n\nI was about to submit a pull request against the Seq Sink, then noticed this thread here. What are your thoughts on the `SeqSink` using a `LoggingLevelSwitch` internally instead of a `LogEventLevel` and allowing the switch to be passed in via the `SeqLoggerConfigurationExtensions.Seq()` extension method instead of the `LogEventLevel`. It's not a Serilog global solution like you are proposing here, but it suits the Seq Sink purpose.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/130566487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"caseymarcallen","id":951165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MTE2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/951165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen","html_url":"https://github.com/caseymarcallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseymarcallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":381155931,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzgxMTU1OTMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/381155931","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-13T07:42:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":381155932,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4MTE1NTkzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/381155932","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-13T07:42:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/131633235","html_url":"https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/505#issuecomment-131633235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/505","id":131633235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTYzMzIzNQ==","user":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","s
