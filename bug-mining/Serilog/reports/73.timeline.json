for the note!\r\n\r\nIt's important to note whether the exception is thrown as far as the caller of the `Log.*` method, or if it just reaches `SelfLog`. Logging the exception to `SelfLog` is currently the expected behavior; throwing it back to the log method caller would be a critical bug.\r\n\r\nThere's some precedent for catching/suppressing these; during capturing (\"destructuring\") property accessors that throw end up logged with the exception as the property value.

And this Bug doesn't happen with the sample code that I sent. And should not happen easily for any user.\r\n\r\nThis Bug was fixed in #1427 too. That bug fix solves this problem for destructuring a class, and  JsonFormatter/CompactJsonFormatter uses the same destructuring code that is now fixed. \r\nBut a very similar bug can happen inside the JsonFormatter/JsonValueFormatter and can be triggered calling the Formatter directly. (See the Unit Test in #1452)\r\n\r\nSelfLog has triggered correctly for `Log.*` methods. Ano no exception is thrown outside `Log.*` methods. \r\n\r\nIn this 2 LINQPad 5 Files (zipped) is easy to see the Bug. [Serilog ToString Bug.zip](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/files/4846747/Serilog.ToString.Bug.zip)\r\n\r\nIn `Serilog ToString Bug - Last Stable` we see the SelfLog logging an error in the Last Stable version one time (in the destructuring phase) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/502282/86031412-a500cb80-b9ea-11ea-9306-d95950665bdb.png)\r\nAnd in `Serilog ToString Bug - Last PreRelease` we don't see the problem anymore because of the fix #1452. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/502282/86031498-be097c80-b9ea-11ea-9e14-a308499ab96b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of that, I think this bug can be closed, but the PR #1451 is still

issue does this PR address?**\r\nThis will solve the feature request #1455- To add support C# 8 nullable reference types in Serilog. And this PR includes the #1452 that is _still not merged_ (Working in this feature help find 2 new bugs in Serilog #1426 and #1451).\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nNo. But this is a big change in the codebase.\r\n\r\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\r\n- [ x ] The commit follows our [guidelines](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [ x ] Unit Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- **xunit** still does not support nullable reference types, and because of that, I had to use a [bang operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-forgiving) in the Test project. When xunit adds supports the bang operator could be removed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/1456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3748201048,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzc0ODIwMTA0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/3748201048","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"6a62806c77bdc65abf2f57223f4a1e804bbb85de","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/commits/6a62806c77bdc65abf2f57223f4a1e804bbb85de","created_at":"2020-09-09T23:21:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11359242412,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAH0Zb84mirXwzwAAAAKlEEis","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/events/11359242412","actor":{"login":"Twinki14","id":5809130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDkxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5809130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14","html_url":"https://github.com/Twinki14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twinki14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"efc4d220b1923f3b2d129d8c138065f205aea188","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Twinki14/CitizenFX.Extensions.Client.Serilog/commits/efc4d220b1923f3b2d129d8c138065f205aea188","created_at":"2023-12-30T02:21:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
