Thanks for the report. Any chance of a couple of pieces of extra info?\n- When you say the third line throws an exception\n  - what is the exception type?\n  - stack trace?\n  - does it escape the `Information` method? Serilog should handle any exceptions internally and never throw them out into the program, so if it is doing this we'd need to fix a bug :)\n- Can you attach the output of Serilog's `SelfLog` as described here? https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Debugging-and-Diagnostics\n\nAlternatively, if you can zip up and send me a repro (nblumhardt@ http://nblumhardt.com :)) I can do the legwork on these bits.\n\nRegarding the scenario--\n\nThese are going to be pretty large (connected) objects to log, so you probably need to investigate custom destructuring policies - https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Structured-Data#customizing-the-stored-data\n\nIrrespective of that though, your example as given should work.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/29141384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nblumhardt","id":342712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/nblumhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nblumhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/comments/29146478","html_url":"https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/75#issuecomment-29146478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/serilog/serilog/issues/75","id":29146478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTQ2NDc4","user":{"login":"chaitanyagurrapu","id":853059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MzA1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/853059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu","html_url":"https://github.com/chaitanyagurrapu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaitanyagurrapu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-24T01:28:52Z","updated_at":"2013-11-24T01:28:52Z","body":"Hi Nic,\nIt throws a System.Reflection.TargetInvocation exception with the message \"Method may only be called on a Type for which Type.IsGenericParameter is true.\" I tried it with the CouchDb sink.

- some improvements in 1.1 of Serilog.nupkg, and 0.9.10 of the RavenDB sink should clear this one up.\n\nThere may still be some instances of the first problem lurking - when converting a dictionary

thanks for the heads-up, I'll have a look again when I can too.\n\nIf you want to get up and running the best option is to transform these enormous non-serialization-friendly types to pluck out the

was only that it would _survive_ serialization of non-DTO types :) but I'd love to flush out any bugs or limitations lurking in there all the same!\n\nBTW, the new version has PDBs embedded, so if you
