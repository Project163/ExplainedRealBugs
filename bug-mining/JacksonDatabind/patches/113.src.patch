     /**
      * Convenience method for doing two-step conversion from given value, into
-     * instance of given value type. This is functionality equivalent to first
-     * serializing given value into JSON, then binding JSON data into value
-     * of given type, but may be executed without fully serializing into
-     * JSON. Same converters (serializers, deserializers) will be used as for
+     * instance of given value type, if (but only if!) conversion is needed.
+     * If given value is already of requested type, value is returned as is.
+     *<p>
+     * This method is functionally similar to first
+     * serializing given value into JSON, and then binding JSON data into value
+     * of given type, but should be more efficient since full serialization does
+     * not (need to) occur.
+     * However, same converters (serializers, deserializers) will be used as for
      * data binding, meaning same object mapper configuration works.
+     *<p>
+     * Note that it is possible that in some cases behavior does differ from
+     * full serialize-then-deserialize cycle: in most case differences are
+     * unintentional (that is, flaws to fix) and should be reported.
+     * It is not guaranteed, however, that the behavior is 100% the same:
+     * the goal is just to allow efficient value conversions for structurally
+     * compatible Objects, according to standard Jackson configuration.
+     *<p>
+     * Further note that functianality is not designed to support "advanced" use
+     * cases, such as conversion of polymorphic values, or cases where Object Identity
+     * is used.
      *      
      * @throws IllegalArgumentException If conversion fails due to incompatible type;
      *    if so, root cause will contain underlying checked exception data binding
