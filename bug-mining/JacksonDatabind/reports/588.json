Boxed **B**oolean values are serialized as 1/0. Moreover, it also works for primitive **b**ooleans.\r\n\r\nHowever, \r\n```java\r\nmapper.configOverride(boolean.class).setFormat(JsonFormat.Value.forShape(JsonFormat.Shape.NUMBER));\r\n```\r\nseems to do nothing, for either types.\r\n\r\nI find this behavior quite surprising. I think it's reasonable to assume any of the following:\r\n1. `boolean` implies `Boolean` symmetrically \r\n2. `boolean` implies `Boolean`, but not the other way around (mirroring the current behavior)\r\n3.  (1) + ability to override the format for the boxed type (to be clear, I've no use case for that)\r\n4.
