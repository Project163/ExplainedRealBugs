currently it is possible to declare a valid `@JsonTypeInfo` in basetype, where `defaultImpl` specifies a subtype that is valid within context of declaration; but use it in a way that triggers an exception for potential conflict.\n\nThis happens when user requests deserialization into a subtype of original type, but one that is not castable to the type of `defaultImpl`. For example, something like:\n\n``` java\n@JsonTypeInfo(.... defaultImpl=DefaultImpl.class)\npublic class Base { }\n\npublic class Concrete extends Base { }\n\npublic class DefaultImpl extends Base { }\n```\n\nwhere deserialization using:\n\n``` java\nBase result = mapper.readValue(\"{ }\", Base.class);\n```\n\nsucceeds, but attempts to do:\n\n``` java\nConcrete result = mapper.readValue(\"{ }\", Concrete.class);\n```\n\nwill fail, because `DefaultImpl` is not assignable from `Concrete`.\n\nWhile code is not exactly wrong in that there is potential problem -- if default implementation ends up required to be used, there would be a cast exception -- it is not necessarily something that will happen, and in fact user may be able to either guarantee it will not, or, even if not it may be better to indicate problem only when it does occur as opposed to merely possibly happening.\n\nThe technical problem is most likely due to inheritance of `@JsonTypeInfo` annotation, so that code has no way of knowing where exactly declaration is bound. If binding was known, base type comparison could use `Base` regardless of expected type, and we could indicate failure only when it actually happens.\n\nIt is not 100% certain that this problem can be resolved, but it would be good to try to do so.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
