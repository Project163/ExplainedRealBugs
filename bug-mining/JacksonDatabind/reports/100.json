This might be ok, except that there is no way to add casts, or to indicate generic parameters. This means that existing annotation properties like:\n\n``` java\npublic @interface JsonDeserialize\n{\n   public Class<? extends JsonDeserializer<?>> using();\n}\n```\n\nwill NOT allow passing in of incompletely, partially or incorrectly parameterized values.\n\nSee, for example:\n\nstackoverflow.com/questions/30513263/incompatible-types-for-generic/305153150\n\nfor an example of failing case.\n\nBut it looks like we may be able to revert to using \"raw\" types for declaration, and basically just drop parameterization completely. This does not actually reduce limits because we can not really ensure compatibility of property value, annotated (de)serializer anyway; but it hopefully avoids Java 8 `javac` error.\n\nWhy good folks at Javasoft chose to do this change I have no clue, but it seems unlikely they'll fix it any time soon. So we need a work-around.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/812/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
