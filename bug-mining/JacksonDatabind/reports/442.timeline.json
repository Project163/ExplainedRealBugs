I think this change leads to a subtle behaviour change when combined with Jdk8Module. We have a test for a `@JsonCreator` method that has an `Optional<JsonNode>` parameter. Prior to this change a field that wasn't present would get mapped to `Optional.empty()`, whereas now it gets mapped to `Optional.of(NullNode)`.\r\n\r\nI guess it's splitting hairs, but previously this meant it was possible to differentiate between an attribute that was missing entirely and one that was present but with `null` assigned. Now they seem to be treated as exactly equivalent.

So, two things should not be directly related: `treeToValue()` has specific handling where `null` from `JsonParser` is received. It should not be used by code that handles `@JsonCreator` values: that should just get `null`. I do agree that `Optional<JsonNode` from null token should become `Optional.empty()`, and not `Optional.of(nullNode)`. Question then is... why did behavior change?\r\n\r\nIF you can easily reproduce this, could you please file an issue against

the bug**\r\nIf you invoke `ObjectMapper::treeToValue` it no longer uses `JsonDeserializer::getNullValue` on the class' declared deserializer when encountering a `NullNode`, instead just returning a plain `null`.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nThe regression began in `2.10.0`, I think. I have tested `2.12.0` and the issue is present there. The last working release I have tested is `2.9.10`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n*pom.xml*\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"

the bug**\r\nWhen using @ConstructorProperties-annotated constructor to deserialize type, for an attribute of type JsonNode which is absent from the deserialized JSON, a NullJsonNode is passed to the constructor instead of null reference.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if there is a workaround (e.g. some annotation indicating what to do for absent properties, or configuring some alternative deserializer on a per-property basis which is able to deal with this) for this issue which works with a constructor and final attributes instead of having to resort to non-final attributes and setters. \r\nSince our project is on 2.7.5 at the moment, I would particularly be intereted if there is a workaround for 2.7.x which allows me to inject null instead of this NullNode at least on a per object basis if not on a per-property basis.\r\n\r\nIf there is no workaround, then this should probably be fixed or a workaround should be provided which works with final attributes and @ConstructorProperties-annotated constructor.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nWhich Jackson version(s) was this for?\r\nReproduced with 2.12.4, 2.9.8 and 2.7.5\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nIf you have a way to reproduce this with:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage jacksontests;\r\nimport java.beans.ConstructorProperties;\r\nimport org.junit.Assert;\r\nimport org.junit.Test;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n\r\npublic class JsonNodeNullTest {\r\n\r\n    public static class TestClass {\r\n\r\n        private final JsonNode nodeFromConstructor;\r\n        private JsonNode nodeFromSetter;\r\n\r\n        @ConstructorProperties(\"nodeFromConstructor\")\r\n        public TestClass(JsonNode nodeFromConstructor) {\r\n            this.nodeFromConstructor = nodeFromConstructor;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public JsonNode getNodeFromSetter() {\r\n            return nodeFromSetter;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setNodeFromSetter(JsonNode nodeFromSetter) {\r\n            this.nodeFromSetter = nodeFromSetter;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public JsonNode getNodeFromConstructor() {\r\n            return nodeFromConstructor;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testJsonNodeNulls() throws Exception {\r\n        TestClass res = new ObjectMapper().readValue(\"{}\", TestClass.class);\r\n        Assert.assertNotNull(res);\r\n        Assert.assertNull(res.getNodeFromSetter());\r\n        Assert.assertNull(res.getNodeFromConstructor());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe unit test fails as res.getNodeFromConstructor() returns a NullNode instead of null.\r\nIt should return null identically to the property which is setter-populated. (The setter does not get called).\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
