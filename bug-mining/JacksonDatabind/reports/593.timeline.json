I still don't understand, why two setters (with String or assignable type) works if at most one mutator is accepted. Is it considered for super class?\r\n\r\nBack to the `getSetter()` question. In this case, there were three setters, with type of  `Integer`, `EnumValue`, and `String`, the first two (`Integer` and `EnumValue`) are not for deserializer, and are not acceptable as valid mutator by jackson. \r\n\r\nLet's try the following case, In the brackets is the type of `_setters` with ordering. (Please also refer to the code of `getSetter()` above): \r\n```\r\n1. [`Integer`, `String`] -> Success\r\n2. [`EnumValue`, `String`] -> Success\r\n3. [`Integer`, `EnumValue`] -> Fail\r\n4. [`Integer`, `String`, `EnumValue`] -> Success\r\n5. [`String`, `Integer`, `EnumValue`] -> Success\r\n6. [`Integer`, `EnumValue`, `String`] -> Fail\r\n7. [`EnumValue`, `Integer`, `String`] -> Fail\r\n```\r\nThese cases should be able to explain the problem. All goes well till these lines:\r\n```\r\n            if (_annotationIntrospector != null) {\r\n                AnnotatedMethod pref = _annotationIntrospector.resolveSetterConflict(_config,\r\n                        currM, nextM);\r\n                \r\n                // note: should be one of nextM/currM; but no need to check\r\n                if (pref == currM) {\r\n                    continue;\r\n                }\r\n                if (pref == nextM) {\r\n                    curr = next;\r\n                    continue;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(String.format(\r\n \"Conflicting setter definitions for property \\\"%s\\\": %s vs %s\",\r\n getName(), curr.value.getFullName(), next.value.getFullName()));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `resolveSetterConflict()` method seems prefer to primitive type and String type:\r\n1. If any one of the first two satisfy the condition, `pref` will be equals to `currM` or `nextM`, the loop can continue, and finally the exact one (with String type) will be found.\r\n2. Otherwise, `pref` is null, then `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. The setter with `String` type has not been checked till now.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/826250113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mistyzyq","id":4506766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDY3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4506766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq","html_url":"https://github.com/mistyzyq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistyzyq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/826370284","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3125#issuecomment-826370284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3125","id":826370284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjM3MDI4NA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-25T18:41:01Z","updated_at":"2021-04-25T18:43:07Z","body":"On setter: key questions is this: is there at most one obvious choice to use or not?\r\nThere are couple of rules that may decide between 2 alternatives: `String` vs `CharSequence` is one such heuristics.
