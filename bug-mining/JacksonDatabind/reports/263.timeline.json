My guess is that this could be related to addition of handling of `@ConstructorProperties` in Jackson 2.7; something that formerly required use of `jackson-datatype-jdk7`. It has been mentioned that there are cases where configuration to prevent generation of annotation are needed -- not sure if that is the issue here or not, but could be one work around.\n\nNote on Hibernate: the original report definitely is related to Hibernate, since `PersistentSet` specifically is included in stack trace.

Hibernate usage is often crucial, although question is whether it is required or not. More often than not it is, esp. so if hibernate module is not used: Hibernate uses proxy types (`PersistentSet`) and it tends to cause problems above and beyond basic JDK collections.\nLombok can also add its challenges, and combination is a royal PITA to support.\n\nAt any rate, what I would need to work on this would be a reproduction:\n1. Ideally without either Lombok or Hibernate, to show a problem in core databind: if so, issue belongs here\n2. With Hibernate, but without Lombok, adding classes as post-processed by Lombok (if that's how it works -- I don't use Lombok myself). If so, issue should be moved (re-created) to `jackson-datatype-hibernate`\n\nI am guessing (2) is the most likely route.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/244790414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
