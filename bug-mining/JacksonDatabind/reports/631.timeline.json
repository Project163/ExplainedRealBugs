is a WIP iterative implementation of UntypedObjectDeserializer. (see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/pull/3416#issuecomment-1074101051 )\r\n\r\nI looked at the existing JsonNodeDeserializer impl, and it is a bit better than this one (it uses a queue, and no intermediate worker objects, unlike this impl). However I don't think that approach can be easily adapted to work with arrays, it relies on adding the child collections to the parent immediately, which can be done with `ArrayNode` and could be done with `List`, but can't be done with arrays because they have fixed size (need to add to the parent *after* it's done).\r\n\r\nThings left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] compatibility: probably need to keep the protected methods, and the Vanilla serializer class\r\n- [ ] perf: old impl had lots of small optimizations (e.g. for <=2-element lists), need to test how much perf this impl lost and do some optimizations for it\r\n- [ ] specialization: just one impl for now. old impl had a simplified \"vanilla\" impl with fewer checks (e.g. no special list deser). could do the same with this approach. could also use a separate queue-based impl (like JsonNodeDeserializer) for the case that doesnt need `USE_JAVA_ARRAY_FOR_JSON_ARRAY`\r\n\r\nI've run the databind tests for this draft, and they pass, or at least don't fail more than without the changes. There are some tests that I think fail for me because I use java 17, not sure what's up with that, but they seem to be unaffected by these changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3427/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-31T22:06:15Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T22:06:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3444","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3444/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3444/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3444/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/pull/3444","id":1192317383,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAC5e2c41nR_P","number":3444,"title":"Non
