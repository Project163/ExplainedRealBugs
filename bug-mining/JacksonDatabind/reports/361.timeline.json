which depends on jackson-databind supports JDK 6 (for a little while longer).   I created #1857 to apply `ddfddfb` on 2.7, it would be really great if that could be included in a future 2.7 release, thanks!","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/351106705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tolbertam","id":6889771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODk3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6889771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam","html_url":"https://github.com/tolbertam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tolbertam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1384615698,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEzODQ2MTU2OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1384615698","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e865a7a4464da63ded9f4b1a2328ad85c9ded78b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/e865a7a4464da63ded9f4b1a2328ad85c9ded78b","created_at":"2017-12-12T23:05:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/351227538","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1737#issuecomment-351227538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1737","id":351227538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTIyNzUzOA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-12T23:18:44Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T23:18:44Z","body":"@tolbertam Thanks.
