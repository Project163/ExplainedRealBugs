I'm late to the party. For the builder in #921 we needed to infer the generic types to instantiate the builder class from a type reference to the actual class.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with mix-ins in Jackson, but I could see a similar strategy here if the mix-in binding via `addMixIn` inferred the type bounds. However, unlike builders where there is some expectation of 1:1 generic types between the target class and builder class, I don't believe this is true with mix-ins.
