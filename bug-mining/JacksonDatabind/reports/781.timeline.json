started to experience the following issue starting from 2.10 in combination with the jackson scala module.\r\n\r\nConsider a POJO like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass SamplePojo {\r\n    private String settlementDate;\r\n    private String getaways;\r\n    private Boolean island;\r\n\r\n    public void settlementDate(String v) { throw new Error(\"Should not get called\"); }\r\n    public String settlementDate() { throw new Error(\"Should not get called\"); }\r\n    public void setSettlementDate(String v) { settlementDate = v; }\r\n    public String getSettlementDate() { return settlementDate; }\r\n\r\n    public void getaways(String v) { throw new Error(\"Should not get called\"); }\r\n    public String getaways() { throw new Error(\"Should not get called\"); }\r\n    public void setGetaways(String v) { getaways = v; }\r\n    public String getGetaways() { return getaways; }\r\n\r\n    public void island(Boolean v) { throw new Error(\"Should not get called\"); }\r\n    public Boolean island() { throw new Error(\"Should not get called\"); }\r\n    public void setIsland(Boolean v) { island = v; }\r\n    public Boolean isIsland() { return island; }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen serializing, one will receive a `JsonMappingException` because both `getaways()` and `getGetaways()`, as well as `island()` and `isIsland()` are considered conflicting getters with the same priority.\r\n\r\nWhen deserializing, both `settlementDate(String)` and `setSettlementDate(String)` will be conflicting setters with the same priority.\r\n\r\nCase-sensitivity should be respected when determining the priority of setters and getters, i.e. `settlementDate()` should not be the same as `setTlementDate()`.\r\n\r\nAlso see `_setterPriority()` in `POJOPropertyBuilder` (as well as `_getterPriority()`):\r\n```java\r\n    protected int _setterPriority(AnnotatedMethod m)\r\n    {\r\n        final String name = m.getName();\r\n        if (name.startsWith(\"set\") && name.length() > 3) {\r\n            // should we check capitalization?\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n        return 2;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll submit a pull request to have this fixed later today.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2729/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15483020803,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAC5e2c4q54P_zwAAAAOa3CYD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/15483020803","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-01T02:17:00Z","label":{"name":"3.x","color":"0E8A16"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15483020805,"node_id":"LE_lADOAC5e2c4q54P_zwAAAAOa3CYF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/15483020805","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-01T02:17:00Z","label":{"name":"3.0","color":"80E086"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15519169482,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAC5e2c4q54P_zwAAAAOdA7vK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/15519169482","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-04T04:49:47Z","rename":{"from":"(3.x)

Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf a property with a capitalized second letter (i.e. `String aProp;`) has a getter/setter whose name has not changed the prop name (i.e. `getaProp()` and `setaProp()`) the property will not be properly serialized/deserialized.
