record should behave.\r\n\r\nI think that's fine. The below test does work on 2.16.x and that suits our use cases for now.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.Test;\r\n\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.module.paramnames.ParameterNamesModule;\r\n\r\npublic class RecordTest {\r\n\r\n    public static final ObjectMapper OBJECT_MAPPER = new ObjectMapper()\r\n            .registerModule(new ParameterNamesModule()).findAndRegisterModules();\r\n\r\n    public record TestObject(@JsonProperty (\"strField\") String testFieldName,\r\n                             @JsonProperty (\"intField\") Integer testOtherField) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void test() throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n        final String result = OBJECT_MAPPER.writeValueAsString(new TestObject(\"test\", 1));\r\n        assertTrue(result.contains(\"strField\"));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's possible that this is the correct and only supported future usage, but there probably needs to be some consideration (an error, documentation, warning, etc) about the presence of a `@JsonCreator` in a `record` that modifies field names or changes the input of the `record`. Another example below:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.Test;\r\n\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.module.paramnames.ParameterNamesModule;\r\n\r\npublic class RecordTest {\r\n\r\n    public static final ObjectMapper OBJECT_MAPPER = new ObjectMapper()\r\n            .registerModule(new ParameterNamesModule()).findAndRegisterModules();\r\n\r\n    public record TestObject(String testFieldName, Integer testOtherField) {\r\n\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        public TestObject(@JsonProperty (\"strField\") String testFieldName,\r\n                          @JsonProperty (\"someOtherIntField\") Integer testOtherIntField,\r\n                          @JsonProperty (\"intField\") Integer testOtherField) {\r\n            this(testFieldName, testOtherField + testOtherIntField);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void test() throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n        final String result = OBJECT_MAPPER.writeValueAsString(new TestObject(\"test\", 2, 1));\r\n        assertTrue(result.contains(\"intField\"));\r\n        assertTrue(result.contains(\"strField\"));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not even sure how the above could work, so it's most likely not valid or going to be supported, but I don't know that as a consumer.
