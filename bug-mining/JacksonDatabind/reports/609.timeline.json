I just hit this problem.\r\n\r\nI actually had set `FAIL_ON_NUMBERS_FOR_ENUMS` to `true` to skip evaluating ints as the index of the enum value. But the code crashes anyway.\r\n\r\nI see that the problem lies in `EnumDeserializer.deserialize()`. For Strings, it looks up the enum value, as given by `@JsonValue`. For ints, it looks up the enum value by position.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is the following: keep track of if `@JsonValue` is an int.\r\n* If not, use the current behavior.\r\n* If yes, then do NOT do enum value lookup by index, but instead lookup the enum value using the same rule as the String one, regardless if `FAIL_ON_NUMBERS_FOR_ENUMS` is set,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the testcase.\r\nEnums using int as `@JsonValue` should parse correctly.\r\nThe test should run without asserts.\r\n```\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonValue;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationFeature;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\n\r\npublic class MyExperiments {\r\n    enum Example1 {\r\n        A(101);\r\n        final int x;\r\n        Example1(int x) { this.x = x; }\r\n        @JsonValue\r\n        public int code() { return x; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    enum Example2 {\r\n        A(202);\r\n        @JsonValue\r\n        public final int x;\r\n        Example2(int x) { this.x = x; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n        ObjectMapper m = new ObjectMapper();\r\n        m.configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NUMBERS_FOR_ENUMS, true);\r\n\r\n        String s1 = m.writer().writeValueAsString(Example1.A);\r\n        String s2 = m.writer().writeValueAsString(Example2.A);\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(\"1: \" + s1);\r\n        System.out.println(\"2: \" + s2);\r\n\r\n        Example1 e1 = m.readValue(s1, Example1.class);\r\n        Example2 e2 = m.readValue(s2, Example2.class);\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(\"1: \" + e1);\r\n        System.out.println(\"2: \" + e2);\r\n\r\n        assert e1 == Example1.A : e1;\r\n        assert e2 == Example2.A : e2;\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(\"PASS\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/439542674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joaoe","id":461983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MTk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/461983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe","html_url":"https://github.com/joaoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/439639391","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1850#issuecomment-439639391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1850","id":439639391,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTYzOTM5MQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-17T18:55:39Z","updated_at":"2018-11-17T18:55:39Z","body":"@joaoe Could you please create a new issue and your test case there?
