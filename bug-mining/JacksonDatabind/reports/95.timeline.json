It would be possible to change this logic, but that is a backwards incompatible functional change; so most likely it should be a new `MapperFeature`.\nI can take this issue to mean requesting of such a change.\n\nIn short term, what you can do is to sub-class `JacksonAnnotationIntrospector` and override `hasIgnoreMarker()` to return true for fields that are transient. This would then work as if field had explicit `@JsonIgnore`. So this should make it work the way you want I think.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/23765768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-05T03:48:07Z","updated_at":"2013-09-05T03:48:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/99","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/99/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/99/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/99/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/99","id":18786596,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODc4NjU5Ng==","number":99,"title":"Creation

the bug**\r\n\r\nIn `2.14.2` and earlier, `transient` fields (with or without `@JsonIgnore`) with a getter (without `@JsonIgnore`) are ignored during serialization and do not emit a JSON property.\r\n\r\nIn `2.15.0-rc1` and `2.15.0-rc2`, they do emit a JSON property.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\nGiven this data class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Foo1 {\r\n    private final Integer a;\r\n    @JsonIgnore private final transient Integer minusA;\r\n\r\n    @JsonCreator\r\n    public Foo1(@JsonProperty(\"a\") Integer a) {\r\n        this.a = a;\r\n        this.minusA = a == null ? null : -a;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Integer getA() { return a; }\r\n    public Integer getMinusA() { return minusA; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this `ObjectMapper`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nObjectMapper json =\r\n    new ObjectMapper()\r\n        .configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, true)\r\n        .configure(SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS, false)\r\n        .setSerializationInclusion(Include.NON_ABSENT);\r\n```\r\n\r\nJackson `2.14.2` serializes a `Foo1` instance to `{\"a\":0}` while Jackson `2.15.0-rc1` serializes the same value to `{\"a\":0,\"minusA\":0}`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n\r\nIssue is not present in `2.14.2`.\r\n\r\nIssue is present in `2.15.0-rc1`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Check out [commit f40ff286 in Yubico/java-webauthn-server](https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/tree/f40ff2860183d26b26942a2123a67017aab2cc02) (branch `jackson-regression-2-15-rc1` - might not persist after this issue is closed).\r\n2. Run: `./gradlew :test-success-2-14:test`. Observe that the test succeeds.\r\n3. Run: `./gradlew :test-fail-2-15:test`. Observe that the test fails.\r\n4. Run: `./gradlew :test-success-2-14:dependencies`. Observe that the resolved Jackson version is `2.14.2`.\r\n5. Run: `./gradlew :test-fail-2-15:dependencies`. Observe that the resolved Jackson version is `2.15.0-rc1`.\r\n6. Run: `git diff --no-index lib/src/main/java/org/example/Foo1.java lib/src/main/java/org/example/Foo2.java`. Observe that the only (relevant) difference is that `Foo1.minusA` is `transient` while `Foo2.minusA` is not.\r\n\r\nAfter running the above, you can see the failed test report at `test-fail-2-15/build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nOne might run into this when using Lombok's `@Value` annotation on classes with `transient` fields - even if the field has `@JsonIgnore`, the generated getter does not inherit the `@JsonIgnore` annotation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3874/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
