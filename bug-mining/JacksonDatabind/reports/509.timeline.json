My first instinct is that yes, it sounds like a bug.\r\n\r\nAny getters are bit special things and do not follow all the rules, mostly because technically they are not \"real\" properties, just a bag of key/value pairs serialized like properties. This presents a few practical challenges in making features that are based on properties (declarations in POJOs) work.\r\n\r\nBut this particular aspect is probably possibly to support at least for overall definitions; and with some work, for any-getter annotations (`@JsonInclude`) too. What might be more difficult would be config overrides (per-type).\r\nBut one fix at a time, so I can first consider global

notes\r\n\r\n1. If and only if direction is not off.... will clean up and refactor. Solution currently seems a bit of refactoring.\r\n2. This might allow \"ordering\" and \"ignoring\" within AnyGetter prop (I haven't found time to check yet tho)\r\n3.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to achieve functionality as per title by making any-getter a `BeanPropertyWriter` (subtype).\r\nPreviously any-getter property has been handled as standalone. Being standalone meaning it need individual handling for all cases, unlike other sub-classes of `BeanPropertyWriter` naturally gets bunch of property handling applied.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nSame as #4396, but rebased against 2.19 version. This PR resolves...  #4388 and  part of #2592 AnyGetter with JsonInclude + JsonFilter combo\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4775/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
