in Spring v3.5.6\n\nI asked AI to explain this issue and it said the cause is a mixture of Jackson v2 and v3 libraries on the classpath. I don't know how much to trust this explanation, but I noticed that there are classes in spring-web (e.g. `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter`) that are importing Jackson v2 types such as `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/47324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/47324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-25T16:48:48Z","updated_at":"2025-09-25T16:48:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5323","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5323/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5323/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5323/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5323","id":3454397797,"node_id":"I_kwDOAC5e2c7N5e1l","number":5323,"title":"`UUID`
