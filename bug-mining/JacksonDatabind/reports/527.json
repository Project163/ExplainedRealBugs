background, see #2656 and #810)\r\n\r\nCurrently, code like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        Properties properties = new Properties();\r\n        properties.put(\"key\", 1);\r\n        String json = new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(properties);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill fail with an exception because all values of `Properties` are assumed to be of type `String`.\r\nThis is due to typing fix made for #810 which leads to selection of `StringSerializer` -- reasonable for most cases but not all.\r\n\r\nWhile use of `Properties` for non-String values seems like a wrong thing to do, maybe we could still support it similar to how coercion of non-String values from JSON content works with `Properties` (for scalars, at least).\r\n\r\n
