am aware of the ability to configure Jackson to serialize BigInteger as a JSON String (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1911) but I believe that it should be the default behaviour,

Add jackson dependency to build.gradle\r\n```\r\n//jackson\r\nimplementation (platform(\"com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom:$jacksonVersion\"))\r\nimplementation (\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind\")\r\nimplementation (\"com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-guava\")\r\nimplementation (\"com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jdk8\")\r\nimplementation (\"com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310\")\r\nimplementation (\"com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin\")\r\n```\r\n3.

For example, 43769.30 is serialized as 43769.3.\r\n\r\n***Exception or Stack Trace***\r\nThere is none.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCreate an entity with a BigDecimal field. Set the value to 43769.30 and save it to cosmos. Look in cosmos or retrieve the entity. The value is 43769.3. The important thing is the scale. Because according to [BigDecimal.equals()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html#equals-java.lang.Object-):\r\n\r\n\"this method considers two BigDecimal objects equal only if they are equal in value and scale (thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by this method)\"\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n43769.30 is saved as 43769.30\r\n\r\n**Setup (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - IDE: IntelliJ\r\n - Library/Libraries: azure-spring-data-cosmos:3.18.0\r\n - Java version: 11 \r\n - Frameworks: Spring Boot\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIn MappingCosmosConverter:\r\n\r\n`final String valueAsString = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(sourceEntity);`\r\n\r\n`valueAsString` has the correct string representation, ie `43769.30`\r\n\r\nbut:\r\n\r\n`cosmosObjectNode = (ObjectNode) objectMapper.readTree(valueAsString);`\r\n\r\nends up with a child node with a value of `43769.3`\r\n\r\n**Information Checklist**\r\nKindly make sure that you have added all the following information above and checkoff the required fields otherwise we will treat the issuer as an incomplete report\r\n- [ x ] Bug Description Added\r\n- [ x ] Repro Steps Added\r\n- [ x ] Setup information Added\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/38691/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/38691/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
