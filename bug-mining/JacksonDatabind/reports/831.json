follow-up to #3601, #5335)\n\nAs of 3.0.1, handling of \"reference types\" (`java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference`, `java.util.Optional`) is inconsistent: in case of \"missing\" (absent) value from incoming JSON, when passed via Constructor:\n\n1. `AtomicReference` is mapped to `null` (same as in 2.x and 3.0.0)\n2. `Optional` is mapped to `Optional.empty()` (same as in 2.x stand-alone module default)\n\nbut neither behavior is configurable. (also note that this mapping only matters for Creator-passed properties, including Records -- for Field/Setter settable, absent/missing value is never set).\n\nLet's add a new `DeserializationFeature` to allow configuring this behavior.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5350/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
