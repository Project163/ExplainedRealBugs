If you had added that one class in there, I would have looked at this earlier.\r\n\r\nLooking at package now code looks ok, and I guess its JDK serialization that does something odd.\r\n\r\nBut instead of requiring use of `getCodec()` from parser, you can try achieving the same only through `DeserializationContext`, and creating `JsonParser` out of `JsonNode`.\r\nThat way you do not need mapper to use \"treeToValue\", but can instead use `readValue(JsonParser, Class)` in `DeserializationContext`.

https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2038\r\nI keep receive NPE on `JsonParser#getCodec()` in a custom JsonDeserializer when trying to deserialize my `House`
