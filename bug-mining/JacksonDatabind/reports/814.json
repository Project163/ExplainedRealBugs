Null-check in isEnabled\nAdd a null check for _writeCapabilities inside isEnabled, and return false if it’s null. This is safe because valueToTree doesn’t actually serialize—instead, the JsonNode simply holds the UUID as a string.\n\n```java\npublic final boolean isEnabled(StreamWriteCapability cap) {\n    return _wirteCapabilities != null && _writeCapabilities.isEnabled(cap);\n}\n```\n\n\n2. Default initialization in the SerializationContext\nInitialize _writeCapabilities with a default value when the SerializationContext is created. This ensures it’s never null, but may be wasteful since a fresh capabilities object will be created anyway once actual serialization occurs.\n\n```java\nJacksonFeatureSet<StreamWriteCapability> _writeCapabilities\n        = JacksonFeatureSet.fromDefaults(StreamWriteCapability.values());\n```","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5225/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5225/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
