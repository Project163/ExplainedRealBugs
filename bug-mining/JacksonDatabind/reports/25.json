If a feature to enable automagic unwrapping of such arrays were provided, then folks could code mapping solutions as simply as\n\n``` java\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\nmapper.enable(DeserializationFeature.UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS);\nint number = mapper.readValue(\"[42]\", int.class);\n```\n\nSuch configuration could also be available through an annotation. The annotation could be applied to specific properties, or to a class (to effectively apply the annotation to all properties defined in the class).\nWhile the argument that this code\n\n``` java\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\nint number = mapper.readValue(\"[42]\", int.class);\n```\n\nsufficiently indicates the author's intentions and provides enough configuration information that ObjectMapper could know what to do – to unwrap [42] to just 42 – I cannot think of any significant benefit to enabling such unwrapping by default. The obvious possible detriment would be breaking existing legacy code.\nFor consistency, this feature should be applicable to single-component JSON arrays of any primitive, null, object, or array type. So, all of the following examples would work.\n\n``` java\nString answer = mapper.readValue(\"[\\\"is 42\\\"]\", String.class);\nboolean trueValue = mapper.readValue(\"[true]\", boolean.class);\nDog dog = mapper.readValue(\"[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"spike\\\"}]\", Dog.class);\nDog nullReference = mapper.readValue(\"[null]\", Dog.class);\n\nclass Dog {public String name;}\n```\n\nThe following attempted use of this feature on a JSON array with more than one component should result in a JsonMappingException thrown by the ObjectMapper. (Though, the current error message that \"Can not deserialize instance of int out of START_ARRAY token\" could be enhanced to recognize the attempt to auto-unwrap the JSON array as if it were a single-component array.)\n\n``` java\nmapper.readValue(\"[42,43]\", int.class);\n```\n\nFor completeness, such a feature could have a serialization counterpart: to wrap a single value into a single-component JSON array.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
