StdTypeResolverBuilder line 65 gets invoked: `_typeProperty = idType.getDefaultPropertyName();` but for `JsonTypeInfo.Id.CUSTOM` the returned value is `null`.\n3..

Notice that \"amount\" shows up twice in the output.\n\nMeaning, \"amount\" gets added to the JSON map once by `@JsonTypeInfo` and once by the implicit `@JsonProperty` on `getAmount()`.\n\nExpected behavior: JSON map should only contain a single instance of the property.\n\nAs a side-note, I'm not sure that the produced output (with duplicate keys) is even legal JSON.\n\nThe workaround is simple, add `@JsonIgnore` on `getAmount()`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1468254320,"node_id":"MDE5OkNvbW1lbnREZWxldGVkRXZlbnQxNDY4MjU0MzIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1468254320","actor":{"login":"FasterXML","id":382692,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4MjY5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"comment_deleted","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-11T02:08:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1468254343,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTQ2ODI1NDM0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1468254343","actor":{"login":"FasterXML","id":382692,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4MjY5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FasterXML/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-11T02:08:54Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
