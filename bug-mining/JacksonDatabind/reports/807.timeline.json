\nI would like to discuss the policy of modifying `EnumSetDeserializer`.\nIn the following code, `_nullProvider` is not called, should it be called?\n\n>        // First: since `null`s not allowed, slightly simpler...\n>        if (p.hasToken(JsonToken.VALUE_NULL)) {\n>            return (EnumSet<?>) ctxt.handleUnexpectedToken(_enumType, p);\n>        }\n>        try {\n>            Enum<?> value = _enumDeserializer.deserialize(p, ctxt);\n>

that the implementation policy is not unified, not only in this part, but also whether `null` should be skipped or an error, and what `_skipNullValues` means within this class.\nPersonally, I feel the following is correct, but what do you think?\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Is JsonToken.VALUE_NULL?] -->|Yes| B[Is _skipNullValues true?]\n    B -->|Yes| C[Skip]\n    B -->|No| D[value = _nullProvider.getNullValue]\n\n    A -->|No| E[value = _enumDeserializer.deserialize]\n    E --> F{Is value null?}\n    F -->|Yes| D\n    F -->|No| M[Use value]\n\n    D --> I{Is value null?}\n\n    I -->|Yes| J[Is _skipNullValues true?]\n    J -->|Yes| K[skip value]\n    J -->|No| L[Throw error]\n\n    I -->|No| M\n```\n\nHowever, if this flowchart were implemented as is, the errors thrown would change.\nWe need to consider whether we want a complex implementation instead of a destructive change, or a simple implementation instead of a destructive change.\nAlso, this issue is a bit different from what I wanted to fix in terms of `kotlin-module`, so I think it should be a separate issue.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2973787646/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k163377","id":24751011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzUxMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24751011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377","html_url":"https://github.com/k163377","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":18155939696,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAC5e2c63ERilzwAAAAQ6Ladw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/18155939696","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T12:46:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18155939701,"node_id":"SE_lADOAC5e2c63ERilzwAAAAQ6Lad1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/18155939701","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T12:46:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2974875086","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5165#issuecomment-2974875086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5165","id":2974875086,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c6xUP3O","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","

For 2.19, let's not change `EnumSetDeserializer`s behavior wrt `null` check, to keep patch version behavior consistent.\n2. For 2.20 (2.x) let's change behavior to more correct.
