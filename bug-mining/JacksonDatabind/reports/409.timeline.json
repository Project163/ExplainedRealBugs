for looking into this.\nI understand what the TypeFactory is being used for. My point is that it is\nto strict checking for matching types. In my example the base class of the\nserialized object has a generics parameter of the type Serializable. The\nspecific object to be serialized has a Type inheriting/extending\nSerializable. The TypeFactory now checkes for Serializable ==\nSpecialClassImplementingSerializable which of course is not true.\nFrom my point of view it would be better to check\nBaseClass.isAssignableFrom(SpecialClassImplementingSerializable). The\nBaseClass is Serializable in this case.\n\nAm Fr., 12.
