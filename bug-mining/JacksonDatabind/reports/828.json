in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/discussions/5289 )\n\n<sup>Originally posted by @bananayong August 31, 2025</sup>\n \n\nRecently I read [the cowtowncoder blog](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-20-0-released-0cc58ed1ea9f)\nFirst, thank you for releasing the most wanted features!\n\nI thought that it would be possible to use `FIX_FIELD_NAME_UPPER_CASE_PREFIX feature` with `ParameterNamesModule`.\nHowever, I ran some tests, and it didn't work.\n```java\n    static class Apple {\n        private final String iPhone;\n\n        public Apple(String iPhone) {\n            this.iPhone = iPhone;\n        }\n\n        public String getIPhone() {\n            return iPhone;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public String toString() {\n            return \"Apple{\" +\n                    \"iPhone='\" + iPhone + '\\'' +\n                    '}';\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\n        ObjectMapper mapper = JsonMapper.builder()\n                .addModule(new ParameterNamesModule())\n                .enable(MapperFeature.FIX_FIELD_NAME_UPPER_CASE_PREFIX)\n                .build();\n        Apple apple = new Apple(\"iPhone 15\");\n        String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(apple);\n        System.out.println(json); // {\"iPhone\":\"iPhone 15\"}\n\n        Apple result = mapper.readValue(json, Apple.class); // Error thrown\n        System.out.println(result);\n    }\n```\n\nIt seems like the property name is determined by the constructor parameter and `FIX_FIELD_NAME_UPPER_CASE_PREFIX` feature is not applied. Is that intended? Or will it be improved in the next release?</div>","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5292/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
