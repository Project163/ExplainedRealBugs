sorry to bring that one up again, but I'm under the impression that the issue about unmodifiable collections (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1880) is still not solved completely.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the way the `CLASS_UNMODIFIABLE_LIST` is retrieved [here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/impl/JavaUtilCollectionsDeserializers.java#L52) yields `Collections$UnmodifiableRandomAccessList`, and therefore only this type is currently supported by Jackson 2.9.8.\r\n\r\nHowever, using `Collections.unmodifiableList()` on a `List` implementation that doesn't implement `RandomAccess` will yield a `Collections$UnmodifiableList` instead, which is not deserialized properly and fails with:\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: Cannot construct instance of `java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableList` (no Creators, like default constructor, exist): no default no-arguments constructor found\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced by adding the following test case in `TestDefaultForUtilCollections1868`:\r\n```java\r\npublic void testUnmodifiableNonRandomAccessList() throws Exception {\r\n   _verifyCollection(Collections.unmodifiableList(new LinkedList<>(Arrays.asList(\"first\", \"second\"))));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr more generally for outside the project:\r\n```java\r\npublic void testUnmodifiableNonRandomAccessList() throws Exception {\r\n    Collection<?> exp = Collections.unmodifiableList(new LinkedList<>(Arrays.asList(\"first\", \"second\")));\r\n    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n    mapper.enableDefaultTyping(DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL, JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY);\r\n    String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(exp);\r\n    Collection<?> act = mapper.readValue(json, Collection.class);\r\n\r\n    assertEquals(exp, act);\r\n    assertEquals(exp.getClass(), act.getClass());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently `java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList()` can only return these 2 types of unmodifiable lists, so I believe it is safe for now to just hardcode yet another special case for this class.\r\n\r\nThis can currently be solved on user side by adding a mixin, but since `Collections$UnmodifiableRandomAccessList` is supported, I would find it natural to also support the non-random access variant.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
