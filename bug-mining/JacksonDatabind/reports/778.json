But if not, throw exception\n* `asBooleanOpt()` like `asBoolean()` but returns `Optional<Boolean>`, either present (as per `asBoolean()`) or absent (instead of exception)\n\nbut as with `JsonNode.xxxValue()` methods like `booleanValue()`, no exception is thrown but quietly default value (like `false` for `boolean`) is returned. For Jackson 3.0 we have unchecked `JsonNodeException` so let's use that instead.\nWe can also clarify coercions that are allowed, as well as extend set of `asXxx()` methods as it makes sense.\n\nRelevant types/methods:\n\n* `asBoolean()`\n* `asString()`\n\nDo we need to add any more?\n\n* `asBinary()`?\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
