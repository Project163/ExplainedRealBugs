Therefore the discussed behavior (`null` or exception) should be configurable, as long as the user is willing to take the side effect of `ACCEPT_EMPTY_ARRAY_AS_NULL_OBJECT` (regardless of target type, empty arrays will be `null`).\n2. Additionally I would recommend to have an additional version of `UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS` where `null` is the default behavior (maybe call it `UNWRAP_OPTIONAL_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS`). This would make it explicitly configurable without side effect.\n\nSince both versions are currently bugged (1.) or not implemented (2.), my current workaround is to intercept and preprocess the JSON
