As a consequence, usage in Spring Data Redis turn to be a very difficult journey ([`GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/redis/serializer/GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer.java) is very popular but not usable with Kotlin).\r\n\r\nIs it possible to include a more Kotlin friendly enum value that would support final classes?
