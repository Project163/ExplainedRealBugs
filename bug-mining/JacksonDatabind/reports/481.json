creates a child context every time:\r\n* it encounters a property\r\n* if the property is collection-like a new context is born for every element in the collection.\r\n\r\nTreeTraversingParser instead creates a child context every time a new object has been created.\r\nThe result is that, for collection-like properties, the current value of the current context is first set with the container object, then with the collection itself.\r\n\r\nI attach a small test case with two tests in which I created a DeserializerModifier to try to append a parent to all children
