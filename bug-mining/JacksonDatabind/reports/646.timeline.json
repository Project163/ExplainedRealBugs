Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nOptional handling differs between Jackson 2.x and 3.0 despite the information that Jdk8 module was pulled in to core.\n\n### Version Information\n\n3.0\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI have a record class with an Optional field. When I use JsonMapper from Jackson 3.0, I'm unable to configure it in a way that will inject Optional.empty if either value is null or absent in the JSON.\n\nWorks in Jackson 2.x:\n\n```\npublic class TestOptional\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\n        JsonMapper.Builder builder = JsonMapper.builder();\n        builder.addModule(new Jdk8Module());\n        builder.defaultPropertyInclusion(JsonInclude.Value.construct(JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT, JsonInclude.Include.ALWAYS));\n\n        Person person = new Person(\"Alice\", Optional.empty());\n        ObjectMapper mapper = builder.build();\n\n        System.out.println(mapper.writeValueAsString(person));\n        System.out.println(mapper.readValue(mapper.writeValueAsString(person), Person.class));\n        System.out.println(mapper.readValue(\"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Alice\\\"}}\", Person.class));\n        System.out.println(mapper.readValue(\"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Alice\\\", \\\"nickname\\\": null}}\", Person.class));\n    }\n\n    record Person(String name, Optional<String> nickname)\n    {\n        public Person {\n            requireNonNull(name, \"name is null\");\n            requireNonNull(nickname, \"nickname is null\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDoesn't work in Jackson 3:\n\n```\npublic class TestOptional\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        JsonMapper.Builder builder = JsonMapper.builder();\n        builder.changeDefaultPropertyInclusion(_ -> JsonInclude.Value.construct(JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT, JsonInclude.Include.ALWAYS));\n\n        Person person = new Person(\"Alice\", Optional.empty());\n        ObjectMapper mapper = builder.build();\n\n        System.out.println(mapper.writeValueAsString(person));\n        System.out.println(mapper.readValue(mapper.writeValueAsString(person), Person.class));\n        System.out.println(mapper.readValue(\"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Alice\\\"}}\", Person.class));\n        System.out.println(mapper.readValue(\"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Alice\\\", \\\"nickname\\\": null}}\", Person.class));\n    }\n\n    record Person(String name, Optional<String> nickname)\n    {\n        public Person {\n            requireNonNull(name, \"name is null\");\n            requireNonNull(nickname, \"nickname is null\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\n{\"name\":\"Alice\"}\nException in thread \"main\" tools.jackson.databind.exc.ValueInstantiationException:
