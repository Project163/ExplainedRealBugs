I have `ParameterNamesModule` and this data class:\r\n```\r\npublic class Data {\r\n  private final String foo;\r\n  private final Integer bar;\r\n\r\n  @JsonCreator(mode =

}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen running `objectMapper.getSerializationConfig().introspect(/* Data type */);` will return a `BeanDescription` that includes `builder` as a property.  \r\n\r\nThis happens because with `ParameterNamesModule` we are able to infer the name of the `JsonCreator` parameter [here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/introspect/POJOPropertiesCollector.java#L451) and when we are, we include this parameter in the properties.\r\n\r\nI think [here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/introspect/POJOPropertiesCollector.java#L438) we should be checking if the creator factory is a delegating kind that takes a complex value as an input. If maintainers of this repo agree, I will file a PR with the fix.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2543/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
