The subtile difference is that is will always serialize Zulu with Z, never +0000 or 00:00.\r\n```\r\nAs far as I can read JDK javadocs, `X` does produce `Z` for zero timezone offset; one that is legal (as well as alternate +00[:00]) for ISO-8601 as well. So I assume those are not problem parts.\r\n\r\nSo I assume you refer to the current (2.11) implementation of `StdDateFormat`, which does (for now) produce only numeric offset. This is easy to change, as comments already indicate (although claiming older specs being problematic, I'll change comment) that behavior was chosen for backwards compatibility.\r\nSince changing that part (+00:00 -> Z) is yet another theoretically tiny, but in practice highly visible -- most likely causing tons of bogus test failures, but also breaking some amount of fragile code -- it seems best to only change colon inclusion for 2.11, and do +00:00 -> Z for 3.0 now. We can consider switch in 2.12 as well, depending on how 2.11 release goes.\r\n\r\nDoes above make

the release notes of Spring Boot 2.3.0 at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes there is no mention of a breaking change in the Jackson update to version 2.11.0 which formats the timezone offset with an additional colon, as per issue at https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2643\r\n\r\nWhile we should have found this ourselves too (we didn't use exact String testing in our tests but immediately parsed to our DTO's too), this resulted in us finding out by a customer integrating with our API contacting us about it. We have updated our tests with some more low-level String validation, however it would have been nice to find out about this in the release notes of Spring Boot too. I understand this comes from a dependency update but it is rather important. As mentioned in the Jackson ticket they have additional plans to use Z instead of 00:00 for zero offsets: \r\n_\"Yes, retain 00:00 for the 2.x line and move fully to XXX in 3.0. I wouldn't really touch that in 2.x as it cause too many confusion with broken stuff out there. Don't make the hodge-podge even worse for now.\"_\r\nSo be aware this will happen again in Jackson 3.0 as well.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/22259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/22259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
