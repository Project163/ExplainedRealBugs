While `.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY)` is set on the `ObjectMapper` of log4j2 JSON layout, null and empty values of map are still present in output.\r\n\r\nThis issue might be reproduced with plain Jackson:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonAnyGetter;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.HashMap;\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    private static class Sample {\r\n        private static final Map<String, String> attributes = new HashMap<>();\r\n\r\n        static {\r\n            attributes.put(\"name\", \"John\");\r\n            attributes.put(\"empty\", \"\");\r\n            attributes.put(\"null\", null);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @JsonProperty(\"map\")\r\n        public Map<String, String> getMap() {\r\n            return attributes;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @JsonAnyGetter\r\n        public Map<String, String> getUnwrappedMap() {\r\n            return attributes;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper()\r\n                .setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY);\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(mapper.writeValueAsString(new Sample()));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn versions prior to `2.9.0` (my assumption - because of #1444) output is (I have tested on `2.5.0` and `2.8.11`):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"map\":{\"null\":null,\"name\":\"John\",\"empty\":\"\"},\"null\":null,\"name\":\"John\",\"empty\":\"\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`2.9.0+` (I have tested on both `2.9.0` and `2.10.2`):\r\n```\r\n{\"map\":{\"name\":\"John\"},\"null\":null,\"name\":\"John\",\"empty\":\"\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Question\r\n\r\nShould this be considered a bug? If it is a bug which version should fix go? Should fix have backward-compatibility flag? Will you accept PR? I can try to prepare one.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nP.S. might be related to #2289.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2592/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
