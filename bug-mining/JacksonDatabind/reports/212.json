am upgrading from Jackson 2.4.6 to 2.8.1 and I have an issue with a class level @JsonInclude annotation. \n\nThe following class runs perfectly with 2.4.6:\n\n```\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class JacksonBug {\n\n    @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY)\n    public static class MyObject {\n\n        private String myString;\n        private List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        public String getMyString() {\n            return myString;\n        }\n\n        public void setMyString(String myString) {\n            this.myString = myString;\n        }\n\n        public List<String> getMyList() {\n            return myList;\n        }\n\n        public void setMyList(List<String> myList) {\n            this.myList = myList;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\n        ObjectMapper om = new ObjectMapper();\n        om.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL);\n\n        final MyObject myObject = new MyObject();\n        myObject.setMyString(\"hehe\");\n\n        final String jsonString = om.writeValueAsString(myObject);\n        System.out.println(jsonString);\n\n        if (jsonString.contains(\"myList\")) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"JsonString contains myList\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen I switch to 2.8.1, it does not worker anymore. The list myList is serialised as an empty list: `{\"myString\":\"hehe\",\"myList\":[]}`\n\nI can work around that issue by moving the exclude to the field level.\n\nI guess this is a bug? Or was the behaviour change intended?\n\nCheers\nRuwen\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1327/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
