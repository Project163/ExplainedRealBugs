So I usually avoid doing combination. This is not to say it can not work, and use case here looks reasonable to me.\r\nOne possible problem here has to do with whether Kotlin sealed class inner classes are static or not -- non-static inner classes can not be deserialized. I assume they are static for now.\r\n\r\nNow... you definitely should not see an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`: there is something wrong in generic type parameter binding resolution on this particular case.\r\nI'll see if I can reproduce this with Java-only definition.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/568019810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/568132719","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2632#issuecomment-568132719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2632","id":568132719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODEzMjcxOQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-21T00:22:20Z","updated_at":"2019-12-21T00:22:20Z","body":"Looking at the original code, there is one part that does not make sense to me (possibly since I do not know Kotlin very well):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata class Foo(\r\n    val bar: Either<String, String>,\r\n    val second: String\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nseems illegal, because `Either` base definition is\r\n\r\n```\r\nsealed class Either<out A, out B> {\r\n    class Left<A>(val value: A): Either<A, Nothing>()\r\n    class Right<B>(val value: B): Either<Nothing, B>()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `String` does not extend `Nothing` (I think ... nothing does, right?).

so, first things first: changed code to avoid `IndexOutOfBoundsException`: will now indicate that type parameters do not match (specialization is impossible).\r\n\r\nNow... while type parameterization is, as far as I can see, wrong, this probably should NOT fail when serializing: after all, object instance exists. Failing on deserialization would seem legit.\r\nUnfortunately type specialization is not specific to ser/deser side (that is, `TypeResolver` does not know), so it is not yet clear if it would be possible to ignore such issues on one operation but not other.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility, altogether, could also be to consider whether substitution from `String` to `Object`, should be accepted as a special case -- perhaps only for \"missing type\" case which can be detected. I am not sure I like that idea, but that could perhaps cover a few legit cases and has the benefit that \"String\" is a type that \"raw\" `Object` does naturally map to (in theory, then, could map `Long` and `Boolean` too ... but `String` is much more common).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/592301311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
