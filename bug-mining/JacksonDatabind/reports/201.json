When run with both patches from #1255, the output is provided in the attached 'both.txt'. When run with just the first patch from #1255, the output is provided in the attached 'first.txt'.\nImportant points:\n1. When the object expressed as an id is contained within a collection or map (List in this example), deserialization works correctly. When it is a field of an object, deserialization is broken.\n2. This particular example doesn't have forward references, but it does have cycles. Nevertheless, I have seen situations where non-cyclical forward-references also do not deserialize properly, with the same caveat as in 1.\n[jackson-test.zip](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/301884/jackson-test.zip)\n[both.txt](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/301885/both.txt)\n[first.txt](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/301886/first.txt)\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
