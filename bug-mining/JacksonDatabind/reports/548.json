Looks like there is use case for something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class VoidBean {\r\n   public Void getValue() { return null; }\r\n```\r\n\r\n(and possibly reverse, to allow \"setter\"... that simply assigns `null`?)\r\n\r\nespecially since that may be needed for idiomatic usage by other JVM language like Kotlin and Scala.\r\n\r\nThe root cause for this not yet working is that both `void` keyword AND `Void.class` type are considered to mean \"Does not return value\", even though only first really does that.\r\nRelaxing this (in `AnnotatedMethod` method `hasReturnType()` solves the serialization case and there is probably something relatively similar for deserialization as well.\r\n\r\nSince this is a change to low-level code, however, it is probably best to consider this only for 2.12, and not yet 2.11.0 (due release soon).\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
