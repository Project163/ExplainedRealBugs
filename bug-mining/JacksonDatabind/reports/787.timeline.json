As per my comment, fixed the initial reported problem. I am not sure what to think about the second part -- I can see the concern, but at the same time, name as passed is assumed as unique type id and is by now the way things work so changing it might cause problems for existing use cases.\n\nBut we could consider changes via another issue at any rate -- perhaps uniqueness check should start by checking implementation class and secondly given name. I think (could be wrong) that the change to use name was for sort of reverse purpose: ability for instances of same class to be distinguished as different modules. But the intent was not necessarily to make instances of different classes to be taken as \"same\" module.\n\nAnd in the end the whole unique/same checking is to try to help in accidental re-registrations, to guard against user
