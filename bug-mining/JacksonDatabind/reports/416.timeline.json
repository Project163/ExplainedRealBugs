But I'll try to offer some perspective on likely reasons I implemented things that way.\r\n\r\nFirst, coercion from integral values to booleans were allowed for interoperability (back in the day Perl did not have `true` and `false` to map to). But it is not clear that values outside of, say, 0, 1 and -1 should coerce; they do now.\r\nBut coercion from `true` / `false` to number seems iffy to me.\r\n\r\nCoercions across integral/floating-point is something where different users have different preferences. I think int-to-float is less controversial (and less problematic too).\r\nThe other direction is up for debate. There are some settings (`DeserializationFeature`s) used for more/less strict coercions, but support is limited, and probably not applied everywhere.\r\n\r\nNow... String-to-number. That is also bit controversial, in general; and in particular difference from floating-point-as-String to `int`. I am thinking that this is 2-part coercion and although it is not necessarily consistent, it seems like limiting could be reasonable (either coerce from floating-point OR from String, but not both). But I think it is one of those cases that grew over time, i.e. not necessarily designed as a system (well obviously... :) ).\r\n\r\nOk. Having said that, I would be interested in solid improvements, one piece/aspect at a time.\r\nMain limitations here, I think, is backwards compatibility.\r\nWe can make only limited changes in 2.9.x patch releases; but there will be 2.10.0, which allows bit more room for changes. For example, bounds checks should go in 2.10.0, but not in patch, just because risk for patches is bigger (I try to keep changes to behavior to minimum, to allow \"blind\" upgrade of patch versions).\r\n\r\nAnd then there is work for 3.0 (`master`), in which we can actually solve most issues.\r\n\r\nThis is why dividing improvements into separate issues may help.\r\n\r\nI think this issue works, then, for `int` / `long` bounds checks, and other aspects can be covered by new issues?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/440891380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1981464647,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5ODE0NjQ2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1981464647","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-22T02:12:26Z","label":{"name":"ACTIVE","color":"f9de7a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1981464650,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5ODE0NjQ2NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1981464650","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-22T02:12:26Z","label":{"name":"2.10","color":"006b75"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/440891880","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2189#issuecomment-440891880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2189","id":440891880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDg5MTg4MA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https:

for your reply. I understand how projects like these grow over time, and since you're supporting a public API, I certainly get that you want to keep compatibility-breaking changes at a minimum.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to hear I'm not totally misunderstanding the library use, but in a way, a bit sad that I won't have a super quick/simple fix to my specific problem. For now, I'll recommend my team use stricter schemas and convert `JsonNode`s back to `String`s before unmarshaling, even though it's less efficient. That should ensure we're processing what we expect, though some of the schema work will require diligence and more careful testing.\r\n\r\n> I think this issue works, then, for int / long bounds checks, and other aspects can be covered by new issues?\r\n\r\nMakes sense to me; use this issue for tracking bounds checks (presumably for 2.10.0) and track other changes elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIs it reasonable for the various implementations to use a common base? I'm not super familiar with the code, so I hope i'm not too confused. I'm guessing the split is between streaming vs non-streaming encoders/decoders? I'd expect it to be possible to put both in a common underlying representation and perform coercions/bounds checks there. What might be nice is modular checks/coercions that can be swapped out for more or less strict checking, as desired, but this might be less reasonable from an efficiency standpoint, which is what I assume is the basis for the split in the first place.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is the best way forward for 3.0?

so, I did add bounds-checks for `int` and `long` access for `TreeTraversingParser`, and matching tests. So that part should now be more consistent.\r\n\r\nOther questions wrt coercions are valid, and it might be good file a new issue. I plan on tackling some aspects regardless, but I think my main concern has to do with configurability aspects, followed by documentation. Implementation should not be as difficult once configurability for specific desired/undesired coercions is defined.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/455056657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2079330159,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA3OTMzMDE1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2079330159","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-17T06:22:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
