Return `null` from `writeTypePrefix()` if no `typeId` passed.\r\n2. In `writeTypeSuffix()`, skip processing if `WritableTypeId` passed is null (but not necessarily if `WritableTypeId.id` is null)\r\n\r\nand hopefully this will allow essentially avoiding the write, in a safe and clean manner.\r\nThe one possible complication case is that of if some existing code relied on `null` typeId being passed (`null` for `WritableId` would never work, would NPE). There isn't any good reliable way to catch that but... let's hope 2.14 RCs give a chance for downstream deps to check.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
