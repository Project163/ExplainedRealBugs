Actually, in the constructor it could use flexible code to automatically detect the construction method to be used:\r\n```java\r\npublic EnumMapDeserializer(JavaType mapType, KeyDeserializer keyDeserializer, JsonDeserializer<?> valueDeser, TypeDeserializer valueTypeDeser) {\r\n    ...\r\n    Class<?> targetMapType = mapType.getRawClass();\r\n    Constructor<...> ctor = ...check if it has a default constructor... (which enumMap does not have)...\r\n    if (ctor does not exist) {\r\n         ctor = ...check if it has a constructor with the enum class type...\r\n    }\r\n    if (ctor does not exist) {\r\n        throw ...exception - no suitable constructor found...\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\nprotected EnumMap<?,?> constructMap() {\r\n    if (use ctor with enumClass) {\r\n         return ctor.newInstance(_enumClass);\r\n    } else {\r\n        return ctor.newInstance();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nPlease note that if the original class extends (e.g.) _HashMap_ then the above de-serialization code succeeds.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1544/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
