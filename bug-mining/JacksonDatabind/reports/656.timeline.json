if I read this issue correctly, then this appears to be similar to an issue in Scala. Java Records are similar to Scala Case Classes. In a Case Class, the constructor params are automatically accessible publicly - essentially Scala compiler creates a scala class with a field and a method with the name of the field. Annotations are added to the field unless you use a special form of the annotation (`@(JsonValue @getter)` is an annotation that is added to the derived getter method instead of the field). Scala 3 has a bug where the `@getter` is ignored so the annotation is not treated correctly.\r\n\r\nSo the ask on my part, is would it be possible to have jackson-databind PojoPropertiesCollector look for `@JsonValue` annotations on methods and fields?

Jackson 2.12.\r\n\r\nOne common pattern in code on my teams is to use 'alias' types to decorate otherwise primitive value types in APIs and/or for dimensional units to gain compiler support for detecting otherwise subtle programming errors (such as using the wrong unit or passing parameters in the wrong order).\r\n\r\nToday, to do this with Java records, we need to write classes like\r\n```java\r\npublic record Watts(@JsonValue double value) {\r\n    @JsonCreator\r\n    public static Watts of(double value) {\r\n        return new Watts(value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWithout the `@JsonCreator` annotated static method (or similarly trivial but verbose constructor), Jackson produces the error\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot construct instance of `...Watts` \r\n  (although at least one Creator exists): no double/Double-argument constructor/factory method to \r\n  deserialize from Number value (<value>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we could place `@JsonCreator` on record classes and infer use of the single argument default constructor I think it'd cut the boilerplate even more. Alternatively, or in addition, it might be interesting to infer that a record class with a single labeled `@JsonValue` parameter should use the default constructor, allowing us to write either:\r\n```java\r\n@JsonCreator\r\npublic record Watts(@JsonValue int value) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n```java\r\npublic record Watts(@JsonValue int value) {}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3180/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3180/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1308770386","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3063#issuecomment-1308770386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3063","id":1308770386,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c5OAkBS","user":{"login":"yihtserns","id":3615932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTU5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3615932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns","html_url":"https://github.com/yihtserns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-09T13:35:45Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T13:45:50Z","body":"> ...though ideologically, I'd prefer to serialize the return value of the getter than the field...\r\n\r\n@cowwoc you can remove the `@JsonValue` annotation from the Record header, and annotate the accessor instead:\r\n```\r\npublic final record GetLocations(Map<String, URI> nameToLocation)\r\n{\r\n\t@JsonCreator\r\n\tpublic GetLocations(Map<String, URI> nameToLocation)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tassertThat(nameToLocation, \"nameToLocation\").isNotNull();\r\n\t\tthis.nameToLocation = new HashMap<>(nameToLocation);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@JsonValue\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic Map<String, URI> nameToLocation()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn nameToLocation;\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## A Trick\r\nSince this issue is caused by [(auto-)propagation of annotation on Records components](https://openjdk.org/jeps/395#Annotations-on-record-components), we learn that the decision to propagate the annotation to either field and/or accessor method is decided by the `@Target` supported by the annotation itself.\r\n\r\nSince `@JsonValue` can be annotated on `ElementType.FIELD` & `ElementType.METHOD`, it gets propagated to both.  Knowing this, you can create a custom meta-annotation for `@JsonValue` that targets only `ElementType.METHOD`:\r\n```\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n@Target(ElementType.METHOD)\r\n@JacksonAnnotationsInside\r\n@JsonValue\r\npublic @interface JsonValueAccessor {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen this will then work:\r\n```\r\npublic final record GetLocations(@JsonValueAccessor Map<String, URI> nameToLocation) // Your custom annotation\r\n{\r\n\t@JsonCreator\r\n\tpublic GetLocations(Map<String, URI> nameToLocation)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tassertThat(nameToLocation, \"nameToLocation\").isNotNull();\r\n\t\tthis.nameToLocation = new
