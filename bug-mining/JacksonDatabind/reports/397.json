Example: I want the \"1.0\" value to be serialized as \"1\" and not \"1.0\".\r\n\r\nHence, I wanted to inherit from the `NumberSerializers.FloatSerializer` class, so as to overload the `JsonSerializer.serialize(Object value, JsonGenerator generator, SerializerProvider provider)` method, but discovered that:\r\n\r\n1. the `NumberSerializers.Base` class is protected ;\r\n2. the `NumberSerializers.FloatSerializer` is final.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to make the `NumberSerializers.Base` class public and the `NumberSerializers.FloatSerializer` not final, please?\r\n\r\nIndeed, this would make the number serializer more open and prevent from copy/pasting the `NumberSerializers.Base` code when writing a number serializer which overloads the default behavior.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
