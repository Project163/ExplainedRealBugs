Hmmh...\n\n2.7 should still work on Java 6 platform, as I've tried to keep loading of Java 7 types dynamic, even if it can not be compiled on Java 6 any more. One thing that would be helpful would be to see if you could locally use 2.7.0-rc2 on Java 6 JVM -- it should work (and does for my testing), although I don't know if Maven would complain.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/165144957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":493597625,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDkzNTk3NjI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/493597625","actor":{"login":"phedny","id":1545224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDUyMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny","html_url":"https://github.com/phedny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-16T15:33:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":493597626,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5MzU5NzYyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/493597626","actor":{"login":"phedny","id":1545224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDUyMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny","html_url":"https://github.com/phedny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phedny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-16T15:33:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/165380422","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1048#issuecomment-165380422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1048","id":165380422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTM4MDQyMg==","user":{"login":"phraktle","id":333139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzEzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/333139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle","html_url":"https://github.com/phraktle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phraktle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-17T08:16:24Z","updated_at":"2015-12

I'm also trying to raise the target version of the library in question, since I do believe no current projects should support Java 6 (people stuck on that should be stuck with older libraries as well
