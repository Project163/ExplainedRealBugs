We try to provide one minor version of deprecation usually (and try not to make incompatible changes unless necessary in generaly). I do not remember why this was not done here (sometimes it is not possible to do so in a way that keeps both old and new methods working). It may have seemed that this should not be something used outside of core databinding functionality.\r\n\r\nSo... it is unfortunate that such a breakage occurs, but part of this is that ideally this class would not be used as an extension point. Internal classes will be more fragile over time; public API compatibility offers stronger guarantees for compatibility.\r\n\r\nI am open to adding something in `2.9.3` that would allow compatibility between versions, if possible.\r\nAlternatively I wonder if public mechanisms for supporting injection (like via Guice module -- in `jackson-modules-base` under `guice`) should not be sufficient: that is, is there real need to extend this class.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/346417033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/346421117","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1835#issuecomment-346421117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1835","id":346421117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjQyMTExNw==","user":{"login":"kinigitbyday","id":2687212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODcyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2687212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday","html_url":"https://github.com/kinigitbyday","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinigitbyday/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-22T17:30:29Z","updated_at":"2017-11-22T17:30:42Z","body":"Appreciate the quick response.

think we use it with our non-json annotations.  In finatra you can annotate a case class with `@QueryParam` to indicate that you're going to hydrate that field with the content of a query parameter, like `/admin/whatever?foo=bar`.  I think this allows us to hydrate a case class partially with stuff parsed from the json, and partially the stuff parsed from the query parameter.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/twitter/finatra/blob/324e77b14ce07914e112bb878326725f187335d9/jackson/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finatra/json/internal/caseclass/utils/FieldInjection.scala#L49","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/417475832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mosesn","id":156562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn","html_url":"https://github.com/mosesn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/417480351","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1835#issuecomment-417480351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1835","id":417480351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzQ4MDM1MQ==","user":{"login":"cacoco","id":613046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzA0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/613046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco","html_url":"https://github.com/cacoco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cacoco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-30T21:57:46Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T21:57:46Z","body":"@cowtowncoder Moses is correct, we're basically trying to provide functionality to parse the JSON body of an incoming request and potentially merge it with other sources into a resultant object. \r\n\r\nMore information on the field annotations [here](https://twitter.github.io/finatra/user-guide/http/requests.html#field-annotations). \r\n\r\nWe want to be able to take the content body an incoming request, parse it as JSON and include fields  injected from the 5 other supported sources into the resultant object.
