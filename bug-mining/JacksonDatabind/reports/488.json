This should indicate all explicitly handled cases, but specifically NOT introspection based \"POJO\" (and similar for Scala, Kotlin) values.\r\nIf support method was added in `Deserializers`  (and something for `DeserializerFactory`), we could add a mechanism in `BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator` to indicate something like \"if type is explicitly supported, allow. This would then support things like:\r\n\r\n1. Basic JDK String-like types (`java.net.URL`, `java.util.UUID`)\r\n2. Basic (JDK) date/time types (`java.util.Date` / `Calendar`)\r\n3. Strings, Booleans, number wrappers\r\n4. `JsonNode` types.\r\n\r\nand 3rd party types of Joda, Guava, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2539/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
