There is a reason why this might not be easily fixable... I forgot that nasty part about annotations is that nulls are not allowed; and so the only way to define optional annotation properties is to define default value.\nAnd in this case, `@JsonSerialize.typing` defaults to `Typing.DYNAMIC`, which in all likelihood is NOT what user wants.
