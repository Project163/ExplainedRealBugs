replacement for #5246) \n\nProperties-based Constructor auto-detection works reliably for 2.x (iff `jackson-parameter-names` Module registered) and 3.x (without anything additional), for cases like this class:\n\n```java\npublic class Point {\n  private final int x, y;\n\n  public Point(int x, int y) {\n    this.x = x;\n    this.y. = y;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(where 2-parameter Constructor is auto-detected for use without need for `@JsonCreator` or `@JsonProperty` annotations)\n\nthis fails if there are any other Constructors. And in particular, this will NOT auto-detect 2-parameter Constructor:\n\n```java\npublic class Point {\n  private final int x, y;\n\n  public Point() { this(0, 0); \n  // ^^^ prevents auto-detection; will be used instead!\n\n  public Point(int x, int y) {\n    this.x = x;\n    this.y. = y;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut we can change rules to allow this specific case so that auto-detection will work if:\n\n1. There is ONE visible (by default visibility rules, `public`) parameters-taking Constructor\n2. That Constructor has names for all Parameters (implicit from bytecode, or annotated)\n3. There MAY be a no-parameter (any visibility) -- aka \"default\" -- Constructor\n\nwhere (3) is the changed rule (CANNOT -> MAY)\n\nNOTE: for backwards-compatibility, there needs to be a way disable this feature:\n\n```\nObjectMapper mapper = JsonMapper.nbuilder()\n  .constructorDetector(ConstructorDetector.DEFAULT\n        // by default is enabled, but we can disable\n        .withAllowImplicitWithDefaultConstructor(false))\n  .build();\n```\n\nto revert to 2.x handling where auto-detection is disabled.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
