For serialization this can even produce seemingly legit JSON output as values are considered just POJOs/Beans, which is problematic as JSON representation will NOT be what module would support, nor something that can be deserialized.\r\n\r\nWhile general case of knowing that something is missing wrt support is unsolvable, the specific case of `java.time` type support may be something we could perhaps detect.\r\nMy first idea is that when looking for (de)serializer, if no (de)serializer found via module registrations, trying to find one for `java.time.*` classes should give specific failure suggesting that module is needed, and NOT try to create Bean[De]Serializer.\r\n\r\nDue to timing concerns (2.11.0.rc1 being tested, official 2.11.0 due soon) this will probably need to go in 2.12.0.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2683/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
