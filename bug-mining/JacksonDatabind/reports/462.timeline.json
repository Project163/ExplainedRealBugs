Base type is the starting point for polymorphic type resolution; but actual properties included may only exist in actual subtype that was serialized.\n\nSo yes, it would essentially tell declared type of the field, since that is typically the main piece of contextual information available during deserialization.\n\nAnd yes, you are following with the ideas I have had: separate base type. I have almost implemented it twice already, but both times started doubting whether this was needed, and what would be the canonical use case...\n\nWhat would be great would, I think, be a unit test that shows the problem with existing usage; case where `writerFor(...)` does not work.
