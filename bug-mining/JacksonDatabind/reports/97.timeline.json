guess a workaround for this is to create a @JsonCreator annotated constructor and pass as parameter the field that needs to be injected. \n\ninstead of :\n\n``` java\npublic class Entity{\n   @JacksonInject\n   private transient Object toBeInjected;\n}\n```\n\n(@JacksonInject will be ignored in code above)\nrather do :\n\n``` java\npublic class Entity{\n    private transient Object toBeInjected;\n\n    @JsonCreator\n    public Entity(@JacksonInject Object toBeInjected){\n        this.toBeInjected = toBeInjected;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe field itself can remain transient, and will be injected thanks to the @JsonCreator constructor.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/73719822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"licarth","id":5550241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTAyNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5550241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth","html_url":"https://github.com/licarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/licarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":305492726,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDMwNTQ5MjcyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/305492726","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-05-15T04:25:25Z","milestone":{"title":"2.6.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/102249689","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/77#issuecomment-102249689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/77","id":102249689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjI0OTY4OQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-15T04:26:18Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T04:26:18Z","body":"Looks
