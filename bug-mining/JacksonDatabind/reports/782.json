Please describe.\n\nWhen using JsonCreator on a factory (static) method, we have the possibility of returning null (because for example all the arguments are empty). However during deserialization an exception is thrown,  java.lang.NullPointerException: JSON Creator returned nul.\n\nI think it would make sense to allow deserialization to null\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nImprove the code robustness in the BeanEntityDeserializer to allow Deserialization to null if a static JsonCreator explicitly allows it.\n\n### Usage example\n\n```\n@JsonCreator\npublic static Localized3 of(@JsonProperty(\"en\") String en, @JsonProperty(\"de\") String de, @JsonProperty(\"fr\") String fr) {\n        if (en == null && de == null && fr == null) {\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        return new Localized3(en, de, fr);\n}\n```\n\nshould be allowed for Deserialization and { en: null, de: null, fr: null } should deserialize to null\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4938/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
