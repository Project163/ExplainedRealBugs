We didn't want to use the default JsonCreator mode out of fear that it may not be as precise, and the decision between `DELEGATING` and `PROPERTIES` mode was not terribly clear, but given that there were no  declared properties, the the properties option didn't seem like the obvious correct choice.\r\n\r\nI agree with your assessment that `PROPERTIES` would have been a better fit in retrospect. I can begin the migration to to use a no-args properties creator, but it will take a few months for most of my consumers to migrate and become compatible with new jackson releases. I'd be thrilled to retain the previous behavior for some time (even perhaps with a deprecation warning and planned removal in a future release if that's preferable to keep the implementation clean).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2331669556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"carterkozak","id":3854321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3854321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak","html_url":"https://github.com/carterkozak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14149224019,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c6VV5_2zwAAAANLXAZT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/14149224019","actor":{"login":"carterkozak","id":3854321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3854321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak","html_url":"https://github.com/carterkozak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"413a4427dfe45302ce50f72872adc59b37a49c9a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/palantir/conjure-java/commits/413a4427dfe45302ce50f72872adc59b37a49c9a","created_at":"2024-09-05T15:21:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"carterkozak","id":3854321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3854321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak","html_url":"https://github.com/carterkozak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carterkozak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-05T15:22:05Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T15:22:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/palantir/conjure-java/issues/2351","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/palantir/conjure-java","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/palantir/conjure-java/issues/2351/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/palantir/conjure-java/issues/2351/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/palantir/conjure-java/issues/2351/events","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir/conjure-java/pull/2351","id":2508101116,"node_id":"PR_kwDOB_y36s56ivPY","number":2351,"title":"Singleton

Search before asking\r\n\r\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues) and found nothing similar.\r\n- [ ] I searched in the [issues of databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and other modules used and found nothing similar.\r\n- [ ] I have confirmed that the problem only occurs when using Kotlin.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nIn Jackson 2.17 and earlier, `object` which implements a `@JsonCreator @JvmStatic fun deserialize()` function serializes and deserializes successfully. After upgrading to Jackson 2.18.0 it fails.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\npackage jackson.test\r\n\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jdk8.Jdk8Module\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.readValue\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.registerKotlinModule\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test\r\n\r\nobject Foo {\r\n    override fun toString(): String = \"Foo()\"\r\n\r\n    @JvmStatic\r\n    @JsonCreator\r\n    fun deserialize(): Foo {\r\n        println(\"Foo.deserialize() called\")\r\n        return Foo\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass JacksonTest {\r\n    private val mapper =\r\n        ObjectMapper()\r\n            .copy()\r\n            .setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT)\r\n            .registerModule(Jdk8Module())\r\n            .registerKotlinModule()\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun shouldDeserializeSimpleObject() {\r\n        val value = Foo\r\n        val serialized = mapper.writeValueAsString(value)\r\n        println(serialized)\r\n        val deserialized = mapper.readValue<Foo>(serialized)\r\n\r\n        assertEquals(value, deserialized)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTest passes with stdout (that’s the behaviour with Jackson 2.17.0):\r\n```\r\n{}\r\nFoo.deserialize() called\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead what happens with 2.18.0 is the test fails with:\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Test output</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.ValueInstantiationException: Cannot construct instance of `jackson.test.Foo`, problem: `java.lang.NullPointerException`\r\n at
