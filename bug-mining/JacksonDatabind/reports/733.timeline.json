For example, with `MINIMAL_CLASS`:\r\n```\r\n{\"inter1\":[\".Inter$A\",\"A1\"],\"inter2\":[\".Inter$A$1\",\"A2\"]}\r\n```\r\n`Inter$A` is the enum, and both `A1` and `A2` are equally valid enum constants. The fact that one is specialized doesn't matter. It's \"basically\" (it's always harder than it looks) looking up the enum constant by name, with or without overridden methods. If it works for `A1` it should work for `A2`.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2443145648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nlisker","id":37422899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDIyODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37422899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker","html_url":"https://github.com/nlisker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlisker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2443305556","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4733#issuecomment-2443305556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4733","id":2443305556,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c6RoeJU","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-29T06:16:57Z","updated_at":"2024-10-29T06:16:57Z","body":"Actually, having said all of that; maybe the problem is reverse: sub-class of Enum `A` for value `A2` (an inner class `Inter$A$1` should NOT be used, but rather it should be serialized same as `A` (that is, `Inter$A` -- this because actual value deserializer will be able to deserialize `A2` for Enum class `A`.
