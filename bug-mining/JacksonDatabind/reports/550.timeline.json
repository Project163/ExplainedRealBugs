was trying to use `@JsonAlias(\"myAlias\")` and `@JsonFormat(with =\r\n {JsonFormat.Feature.ACCEPT_CASE_INSENSITIVE_PROPERTIES})` at a property at version `2.9.2` (bom) -- current latest jackson-databind version. Unfortunately this failed. Enabling it globally though worked fine. As far as I've checked it, it is related to #1232 which added support for case insensitive properties configured at properties rather than globally and #1029 adding support for `@JsonAlias` (provided by FasterXML/jackson-annotations#116).\r\n\r\nMy debugging lead me to the following:\r\n1. `BeanPropertyMap` gets created with `caseInsensitive = false` due to the global configuration at which the alias mapping gets setup case sensitive\r\n2. `BeanPropertyMap.withCaseInsensitivity` gets called with the config from `JsonFormat`\r\n3. this call creates a new instance of `BeanPropertyMap` by using the constructor `BeanPropertyMap(BeanPropertyMap base, boolean caseInsensitive)` which just copies the case sensitive aliasMapping and aliasDef.\r\n4. `BeanPropertyMap.find` converts the key to lower case due it being in the case insensitive state. As it does not find the property, it will continue at `_find2` by passing `_aliasMapping.get(key)` to `_findWithAlias` etc. Neither of those check for the case insensitive state, the key is already in lower case but the mapping is still in it's original case sensitive form.\r\n\r\nThis leads to that it works only for the property name itself, but not for it's alias names.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1429622771,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTQyOTYyMjc3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1429622771","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-18T03:35:09Z","rename":{"from":"Allow use of `@JsonFormat(with=JsonFormat.Feature.ACCEPT_CASE_INSENSITIVE_PROPERTIES }` on Class","to":"Allow use of `@JsonFormat(with=JsonFormat.Feature.ACCEPT_CASE_INSENSITIVE_PROPERTIES)` on Class"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/408196664","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1886#issuecomment-408196664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1886","id":408196664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODE5NjY2NA==","user":{"login":"JavierSegoviaCordoba","id":7463564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjM1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7463564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba","html_url":"https://github.com/JavierSegoviaCordoba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavierSegoviaCordoba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-26T18:45:16Z","updated_at":"2018-07-26T18:57:06Z","body":"It isn't working for me (class or properties).
