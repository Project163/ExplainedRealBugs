changed my mind on this one, after looking at the code before/after. Open to your thoughts, @cowtowncoder.\r\n\r\nHere's the new code in 2.10 (see BaseJsonNode):\r\n\r\n```\r\n   @Override\r\n   public String toString() {\r\n       return InternalNodeMapper.nodeToString(this);\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   @Override\r\n   public String toPrettyString() {\r\n       return InternalNodeMapper.nodeToPrettyString(this);\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI read this code as saying, \"if you want a pretty printed rendering of the Json, use toPrettyString(), or, for non-pretty version, using toString()\". \r\n\r\nAnd looking at the toString() method for MissingNode in 2.9, we see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\npublic String toString() {\r\n    // toString() should never return null\r\n    return \"\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a user of version 2.9 of the library, I think it's reasonable to believe that MissingNode would continue to return an empty string in version 2.x of the library (e.g. 2.10+) on call to toString().\r\n\r\nThat's also what I got from your comment this ticket (at the bottom): https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/25.    You wrote: \"Anyone reading this issue: if you would prefer to see a String value (most likely either \"\" or \"null\"), please file a new issue with the request for change. Such could be considered for Jackson 3.0.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, I like the current behavior.  I think returning \"null\" for a MissingNode.toString() is counter-intuitive.  A NullNode represents a \"null\" value.  MissingNode represents something entirely different -- it's really just a placeholder, sort of like java.lang.Optional, to avoid null checks everywhere.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/563078895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"arakelian","id":1766075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1766075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian","html_url":"https://github.com/arakelian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arakelian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2865034656,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg2NTAzNDY1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2865034656","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-09T06:07:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2865034657,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4NjUwMzQ2NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2865034657","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-09T06:07:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/563503530","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2566#issuecomment-563503530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2566","id":563503530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzUwMzUzMA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://a
