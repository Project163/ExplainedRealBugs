of biggest challenges supporting handling of value types of non-Java JVM languages like Kotlin and Scala is the fact that they have more advanced facilities for defining value types (like case / data classes), and using naming conventions that often differ in some ways from Java Bean convention (esp. since Java Beans only rely on getter/setter whereas newer approaches start with fields).\r\nWork so far (up to 2.10) has tried to tweak existing one-size-fits-all behavior; and even some newer ideas focus on adding on/off features to support some of edge cases (like Kotlin's \"is-getter\" naming discrepancy from Java Beans).\r\n\r\nBut maybe it is time to think of bigger picture: what if it was possibly to do something similar to `Bean[De]SerializerModifier` -- which allows changing set of properties a (de)serializers has, their ordering (for serialization), or even replace standard (de)serializer completely -- but at an earlier point, where individual \"accessors\" (prospective getters, setters, fields) are being connected.\r\nAt this point it should be possible fully override rules of how accessors are combined (f.ex allow case-insensitive matching, or to start with specific accessor (fields) instead of trying to mangle names in isolation), and perhaps even change name mangling basics (apply different rules of determining likely \"implicit name\" before explicit renaming by annotations).\r\n\r\nI am not sure exactly how this should be done, but this functionality should probably change behavior of at least:\r\n\r\n* `POJPropertiesCollector`: container for information on all logical properties of a POJO, tentative properties: contains a set of `POJOPropertyBuilder`s\r\n* `POJOPropertyBuidler`: container for information on a single individual tentative POJO property\r\n\r\nAfter application of extension point(s) behavior should be unified in that core `jackson-databind` would simply use modified set of properties to create otherwise regular Bean[De]Serializers, without further need for further custom implementations (or at least much reduced need for complete replacements).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/569371272","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2527#issuecomment-569371272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2527","id":569371272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTM3MTI3Mg==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-28T00:59:26Z","updated_at":"2019-12-28T00:59:26Z","body":"After

suggested an upgrade from Spring Boot 2.2.7 to 2.3.0, but the build failed; I checked it out and had the same failures. It looked like a Jackson issue, so I went back to Spring Boot 2.2.7 with Jackson 2.11.0, the version used in Spring Boot 2.3.0, and had the same problem.\r\n\r\nI'm having this problem in a Kotlin project, but using Jackson-module-kotlin 2.11.0 alone doesn't seem to cause the problem.\r\n\r\nI'm having the same problem in two places, the problem seems to be about the same in each case.  It's roughly something like this: I have an API request object that can come in multiple forms, say, an `owner` that can be a person or organization.  So `OwnerRequest` has an `organization` property, but it also has a private internal val `isOrganization` that returns a boolean if the `organization` field is set.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\ndata class OwnerRequest(val person: Person = null, val organization: Organization = null) {\r\n    private val isOrganization = this.organization != null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see how there's a risk of confusion here, since Kotlin exposes getters and setters for Vals, and by java bean standards `is<Property>` could be a boolean getter for a a property. But in Jackson 2.10.4, all behaves as desired, and there hasn't been a problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I replace 2.10.4 with 2.11.0, now there's a problem.  Suddenly, the server is responding as if `organization` wasn't set (triggering a validation failure).\r\n\r\nAs a reproduction, this test:\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass JacksonTest {\r\n\r\n\tprivate val jackson = ObjectMapper()\r\n\t\t.findAndRegisterModules()\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tfun testOwnerDeserialization() {\r\n\t\tval value: OwnerRequest = jackson.readValue(\r\n\t\t\t\t\"\"\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"org\": \"Wayne Industries\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\"\"\".trimIndent(),\r\n\t\t\t\tOwnerRequest::class.java\r\n\t\t)\r\n\t\tassertThat(value.org).isEqualTo(\"Wayne Industries\")\r\n\t\tassertThat(value.toString()).isEqualTo(\"OwnerRequest(org=Wayne Industries, isOrg=true)\")\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass OwnerRequest(val org: String? = null) {\r\n\tprivate val isOrg = org != null\r\n\toverride fun toString(): String {\r\n\t\treturn \"OwnerRequest(org=$org, isOrg=$isOrg)\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\npasses in 2.10.4 and fails in 2.11.0.\r\n\r\nHere's the failure:\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field \"org\" (class ca.cpp.api.submitapi.OwnerRequest), not marked as ignorable (one known property: \"isOrg\"])\r\n at [Source: (String)\"{\r\n\t\"org\": \"Wayne Industries\"\r\n}\"; line: 3, column: 2] (through reference chain: ca.cpp.api.submitapi.OwnerRequest[\"org\"])\r\n\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException.from(UnrecognizedPropertyException.java:61)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext.handleUnknownProperty(DeserializationContext.java:855)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.StdDeserializer.handleUnknownProperty(StdDeserializer.java:1206)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializerBase.handleUnknownProperty(BeanDeserializerBase.java:1592)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializerBase.handleUnknownProperties(BeanDeserializerBase.java:1542)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer._deserializeUsingPropertyBased(BeanDeserializer.java:511)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializerBase.deserializeFromObjectUsingNonDefault(BeanDeserializerBase.java:1310)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer.deserializeFromObject(BeanDeserializer.java:331)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer.deserialize(BeanDeserializer.java:164)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper._readMapAndClose(ObjectMapper.java:4482)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.readValue(ObjectMapper.java:3434)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.readValue(ObjectMapper.java:3402)\r\n\tat ca.cpp.api.submitapi.JacksonTest.testOwnerDeserialization(JacksonTest.kt:23)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:50)\r\n\tat org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:12)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:47)\r\n\tat org.junit.internal.runners.statements.InvokeMethod.evaluate(InvokeMethod.java:17)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runLeaf(ParentRunner.java:325)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:78)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:57)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.run(ParentRunner.java:290)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.schedule(ParentRunner.java:71)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:288)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:58)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$2.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:268)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:363)\r\n\tat org.junit.runner.JUnitCore.run(JUnitCore.java:137)\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/340/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
