But as to `NON_DEFAULT`, it has two distinct modes:\n1. When used for specific class, it will try to use default values for properties as assigned by the default no-arguments constructor: one must exist.\n2. If used on property or as global default inclusion, value to check are default values for the type (in case of scalars, value that a class member would be initialized to; for other types, same as \"empty\" value)\n\nSo with global defaults, excluded value for double should be just `0.0`. For `LocalDate` I would except `null` or one with timestamp of `0`; although that depends on `LocalDate` serializer defining that rule (via `isEmpty()`).\n\nPut another way, rules for `LocalDate` and

I upgraded to version 2.9.0 I hit [#1586](https://github.com/fasterxml/jackson-databind/issues/1586). I believe this is a valid issue. My use case requires setting Include.NON_DEFAULT globally and serialize -> deserialize must result in the same object. As per [#1351](https://github.com/fasterxml/jackson-databind/issues/1351), Include.NON_DEFAULT has two distinct modes.\r\n\r\n> 1. When used for specific class, it will try to use default values for properties as assigned by the default no-arguments constructor: one must exist.\r\n> 2. If used on property or as global default inclusion, value to check are default values for the type (in case of scalars, value that a class member would be initialized to; for other types, same as \"empty\" value)\r\n\r\nMode 1 is how Jackson used to work when Include.NON_DEFAULT was set globally prior to version 2.8.3. It produces the objects that are the same after serialization and desarialization. Mode 2 can result in cases where serialize -> deserialize produces different objects. For my use case I need consistency (Mode 1)  globally so I attempted to use the workaround suggested in [#1586](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1586).\r\n\r\n> Value non_default = JsonInclude.Value.construct(Include.NON_DEFAULT, Include.NON_DEFAULT);\r\nobjectMapper.configOverride(Holder.class).setInclude(non_default);\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be too cumbersome because I have many classes including nested classes that would need to be set individually. For now I am staying with version 2.8.2, the last version before this regression was introduced.\r\n\r\nI understand Mode 2 was difficult to implement technically.

`{\"value\":false}` (as I expected). This however changes starting with 2.8.3: it outputs `{}` (tested with 2.8.3, 2.8.11.2 and 2.9.6). I guess it was affected by #1351. Was it intended? Imo that's bug: default value for `Boolean` is `null`, not `false`.
