Correct, the features in question are handled separately.

the bug**\r\nAs stated in issue #1588 (further discussions in #1095 and #1106), there is currently no way to prevent mapping of an empty string (\"\") to Java \"numbers\" (java.lang.*: e.g. java.lang.Short, java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Long, java.lang.Double), - this always gets converted to null.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there is no difference between specifying (null) and (\"\") and there is no way to distinguish between the two.\r\n\r\nDisabling MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS is of no use, as it prevents valid numbers specified in a string to be processed (e.g.
