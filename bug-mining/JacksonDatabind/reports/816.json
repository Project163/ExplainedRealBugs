Please describe.\n\nIn 3.0, `AnnotatedMember` does not have a non-deprecated way to search for meta-annotations. For example, let's say there's a custom `ValueSerializerModifier` activated by an annotation called `Foo`, and this `Foo` annotation is supposed to be usable as a meta-annotation. In other words, if annotation `Bar` is annotated with `Foo`, then the custom code should be able to find the `Foo` annotation (on `Bar`) even if the member us annotated only with `Bar`.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nRemoving the deprecation notice from `AnnotatedMember.getAllAnnotations()` would be one way to resolve the issue. This would allow custom code to search for meta-annotations by inspecting all annotations on the member.\n\n### Usage example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
