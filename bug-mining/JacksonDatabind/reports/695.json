Local name\r\n2. Namespace\r\n\r\nso that, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@JacksonXmlProperty(isAttribute=true)\r\n@JsonProperty(namespace=\"uri:ns1\", value=\"prop\")\r\npublic int value;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere first annotation has precedence (annotation introspector that handles it is the first introspector configured for `AnnotationIntrospectorPair`) we should have localName and namespace from `@JsonProperty` since `JacksonXmlProperty` defines neither (that is, has defaults of \"\").\r\nCurrently this is not the case.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
