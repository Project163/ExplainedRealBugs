the bug**\r\n\r\nStarting with Jackson Databind 2.13.0, deserializing a polymorphic type with a default implementation (`JsonTypeInfo.defaultImpl`) and an explicit `null` for the type ID will produce an instance of the concrete type in which the type ID is `null` instead of a value provided during construction (in its constructor/`@JsonCreator` method).\r\n\r\nIn Jackson Databind 2.12.5 and earlier, this produced an instance of the concrete type in which the type ID field had the value assigned in the constructor/`@JsonCreator` method.\r\n\r\nWe're using Jackson Databind to deserialize user-provided input, so unfortunately we cannot prevent them from sending JSON payloads with `null` in the type ID field, even if it isn't valid in the first place.\r\n\r\n**Version

}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWith Jackson Databind 2.12.5, the unit test succeeds while with Jackson Databind 2.13.0 it fails because `object.type` is `null` instead of using the value of the default implementation `TypeA` (\"A\"):\r\n```text\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <A> but was: <null>\r\n\tat app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionUtils.fail(AssertionUtils.java:55)\r\n\tat app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionUtils.failNotEqual(AssertionUtils.java:62)\r\n\tat

app//jackson.polymorphic.bug.PolymorphicTest.deserializingPolymorphicTypeFillsTypeInfoField(PolymorphicTest.java:24)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI suspect this behavior was changed in the context of https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3271 and https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/32eee1b92b174f363ee42b716790189c11714325.\r\n\r\nIf the new behavior is intentional, it should be mentioned in the release notes for Jackson 2.13.0 as a breaking change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3313/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3313/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/953239641","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3271#issuecomment-953239641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3271","id":953239641,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c440UhZ","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-27T19:22:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T19:22:54Z","body":"....
