The more tangled the net has become the slower the cache ramp up times have gradually become. The net was not completely a tree like structure so the clever incomplete serializer tracking did not always apply. I found out that the cacheability that I normally gain with bean deserializers is gone when I use a converter. \r\n\r\nI understand the following fix..\r\n\r\n```\r\n// 27-Mar-2015, tatu: As per [databind#735], avoid caching types with custom value desers\r\nboolean addToCache = !_hasCustomValueHandler(type) && deser.isCachable();\r\n```\r\n\r\n.. because there is no way to know whether or not the custom value (or type) handler can be considered 100% cacheable. With the converter it would be the same except that along it there has been provided a delegate deserializer that in my case just happens to be the good old cacheable bean deserializer. With the `isCachable` delegation seen below I got the cache to be applied, but it seems to me to be somehow too obvious of a fix.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\npublic class StdDelegatingDeserializer<T>\r\n    extends StdDeserializer<T>\r\n    implements ContextualDeserializer, ResolvableDeserializer\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * Underlying serializer for type <code>T</code>.\r\n     */\r\n    protected final JsonDeserializer<Object> _delegateDeserializer;\r\n\r\n    @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\r\n    public StdDelegatingDeserializer(Converter<Object,T> converter,\r\n            JavaType delegateType, JsonDeserializer<?> delegateDeserializer)\r\n    {\r\n        super(delegateType);\r\n        _converter = converter;\r\n        _delegateType = delegateType;\r\n        _delegateDeserializer = (JsonDeserializer<Object>) delegateDeserializer;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean isCachable()\r\n    {\r\n        return _delegateDeserializer == null ? super.isCachable() : _delegateDeserializer.isCachable();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2014/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
