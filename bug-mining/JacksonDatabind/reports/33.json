Subsequently, in `PropertyBasedCreator#construct`, we will construct a contextualized Deserializer if and only if a Deserializer is not already present:\n\n``` java\nif (!prop.hasValueDeserializer()) {\n    prop = prop.withValueDeserializer(ctxt.findContextualValueDeserializer(prop.getType(), prop));\n}\n```\n\n([source](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.3/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/impl/PropertyBasedCreator.java#L95))\n\nHowever, this returns false because we do have a value deserializer.\n\nFinally, we attempt to deserialize using this PropertyBasedCreator, within `BeanDeserializer#_deserializeUsingPropertyBased`:\n\n``` java\nObject value = creatorProp.deserialize(jp, ctxt);\n```\n\n([source](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.3/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/BeanDeserializer.java#L314))\n\nThis fails, however, as our Deserializer was never contextualized.\n\nIf this is indeed a bug, I think a simple fix may be to simply contextualize the Deserializer within `PropertyBasedCreator#construct` if it's present. Let me know if that is a good solution; I can make a PR if desired.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
