(At dcdc5e4 of master branch):\n\n```\npackage com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std;\n...\n...\n250  int i = value.indexOf(':');\n251  if (i != -1 && value.indexOf(':', i + 1) == -1) {\n252      // host:port\n253      int port = Integer.parseInt(value.substring(i));\n254      return new InetSocketAddress(value.substring(0, i), port);\n255  } else {\n256      // host or unbracketed IPv6, without port number\n257      return new InetSocketAddress(value, 0);\n258  }\n```\n\nLine 253 should be the follow instead:\n\n```\n253      int port = Integer.parseInt(value.substring(i + 1));\n```\n\nThe substring should start from `i + 1` instead of `i`. `i` points to the colon while `i + 1` points to the beginning of the port number.\n\nIf possible, please backport this to version (branch 2.3) as well, where the corresponding snippet can be found as [InetSocketAddressDeserializer.java](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.3/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/std/InetSocketAddressDeserializer.java)\n\n```\npackage
