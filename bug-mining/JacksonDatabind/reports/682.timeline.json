It all goes back to having context, so -- as far as I know -- the only reliable way is to resolve full `Class<?>` declarations; even when only needing `Method`, `Field` etc types. This is why ClassMate does this.\r\nAnd Jackson tries to encourage that, to a degree.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, this sort of suggests that ability to use types ClassMate resolves -- it does it still better than Jackson, since I wrote it after Jackson -- would be good addition to Jackson, in some way or form.\r\n\r\nBut as to how to make Jackson use full type information... `TypeFactory` does allow constructing things programmatically to cover cases I can think of. Whether that can be used for general handling I don't know.\r\n\r\nAnd of course there is always Java Type Erasure that ultimately limits runtime information determination.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1756360815/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10610682852,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAC5e2c5zZ0iFzwAAAAJ4civk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/10610682852","actor":{"login":"garretwilson","id":627125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzEyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/627125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/garretwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-10T22:34:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10610682856,"node_id":"SE_lADOAC5e2c5zZ0iFzwAAAAJ4civo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/10610682856","actor":{"login":"garretwilson","id":627125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzEyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/627125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/garretwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-10T22:34:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
