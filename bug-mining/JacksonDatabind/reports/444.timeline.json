If so, in case of root value, you are saying that the runtime type is base type. This will not work very well. But I can see now why you are asking for the feature.\r\n\r\nI actually have come to conclusion that it is often/usually bad idea to use either generic or polymorphic types as root values, and that it is better to have a wrapper as necessary. So you would have something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Wrapper {\r\n   @JsonTypeInfo(....)\r\n   public Object value;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich then establishes polymorphic nature of `value`, using `java.lang.Object` as base type (or whatever type you want).\r\n\r\nBut as to your specific case: what would be nominal type to request on deserialization? That type would need to be the base type, and since it would not make much sense to use original type (if that is known why enable polymorphic type info in the first place).\r\nIn practice use of different base type on deserialization may work with default typing, as long as inclusion rules match (which probably does work here).\r\n\r\nAnd on solution: I am not completely opposed to adding another type indicating \"everything\" if that is needed in practice. It should be also possible to separate intended base type from value type (former is for type id handling; latter actual Json(De)Serializer), and I think there is probably even an old issue for this. But it is not yet implemented.\r\n\r\nI will add this issue on my (long) W-I-P list since that old issue (once I locate) probably should be addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/501408585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/525530661","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2349#issuecomment-525530661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2349","id":525530661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTUzMDY2MQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-28T00:10:46Z","updated_at":"2019-08-28T20:14:17Z","body":"Hmmh.
