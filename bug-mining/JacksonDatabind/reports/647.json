I agree that the ability to control such facets of coercion is fantastic, but I'm not sure that the feature should impact `MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS` for a case that can be considered a valid format in JSON (`1` vs `1.0`, I would argue both are valid representations of `(float) 1`).\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, I would use the new coercion configuration type, however this is not always possible due to cross-version compatibility requirements. Dependency resolution from 2.13.x to 2.14.0 will potentially cause deserialization to fail unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nWhich Jackson version(s) was this for?\r\n2.14.0-rc2, introduced in 2.14.0-rc1.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nIf you have a way to reproduce this with:\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a test which fails on the tip of 2.14.0, and passes with the proposed fix in the PR: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/pull/3625\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf reproduction itself needs further explanation, you may also add more details here.\r\n\r\nIdeally the semantics of `MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS` would not be modified by the introduction of support for configuring integer to float coercion. I would propose special-casting the behavior of `ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS`  to exclude failing int-to-float coercion, maintaining existing behavior.\r\n\r\nAny feedback you have is appreciated, thanks!","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3624/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
