It is in the ObjectMapper(ObjectMapper) copy constructor, and it does this:\n\n```\n    HashMap<ClassKey,Class<?>> mixins = new HashMap<ClassKey,Class<?>>(src._mixInAnnotations);\n    _serializationConfig = new SerializationConfig(src._serializationConfig, mixins);\n    _deserializationConfig = new DeserializationConfig(src._deserializationConfig, mixins);\n```\n\nWhat's funny about it, I think, is that it ignores this._mixInAnnotations;  instead it creates a new, separate instance of the HashMap, initializes it, and wires up SerializationConfig and DeserializationConfig to use that instance, leaving this._mixInAnnotations out in the cold.  Looks to me like a bug, but maybe it's a cunning feature.\n\nCan/should it just do _mixInAnnotations.putAll(src._mixInAnnotations) instead, and then use _mixInAnnotations for SerializationConfig and DeserializationConfig?\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
