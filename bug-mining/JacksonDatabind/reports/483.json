same is true for Tree Model based handling.\r\nThis is implemented by re-encoding binary as Base64 content.\r\nHowever, specialized String-value collection/array deserializers are missing this case: they use method \"_parseString()\" from `StdDeserializer`.\r\n\r\nGiven that default String handling does this, it makes sense to support same coercion for container cases.\r\n\r\nNote: testing probably needs to be done from format modules as JSON backend can not induce `VALUE_EMBEDDED_OBJECT` tokens (although testing handling of `TokenBuffer` might make sense -- maybe easiest still via binary codecs): for example, from cbor backend for which original issue was reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2535/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
