All parameters have name (implicit or explicit), or are marked as injectable AND\n2. There are no other visible constructors AND\n3. There is no default (no-arg) constructor (which otherwise would be detected regardless of visibility)\n\nIn addition, there is one practical limitation due to existing resolution rules:\n- Single-argument constructor will default to \"delegating\" constructor, so implicit names are only used if `@JsonCreator` is used to indicate \"property-based\" constructor use, or explicit names.\n\nNote, too, that language modules (like `jackson-module-scala`) may refine rules for more accurate detection of the \"main\" constructor; this functionality refers to vanilla handling for Java.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
