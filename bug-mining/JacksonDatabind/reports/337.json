It seems like when calling `getIntValue()` where the number value is bigger than the Java integer (32bit) limit might produce a wrong result instead of throwing an exception saying the number is too big. When not using a `TokenBuffer` parser, but when an implementation of `ParserBase` is used, I get some expected exceptions saying `Numeric value ... out of range of int`.\r\n\r\nHere's a `TokenBuffer` example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nTokenBuffer tb = new TokenBuffer(new ObjectMapper(), false);\r\ntb.writeNumber(\"-4294967295\");\r\n\r\nJsonParser jp = tb.asParser();\r\njp.nextToken();\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println(\"jp.getIntValue() = \" + jp.getIntValue());\r\n// returned value is 1\r\n```\r\n_(using a recent 2.9.1-SNAPSHOT build)_\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever as you can [see here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/base/ParserBase.java#L646), `ParserBase.getIntValue()` tries to convert the int, which if not valid fails, and throws the expected exception of int overflow.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1729/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1729/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
