2.20, missing value for `@JacksonInject` is indicated by one of:\n\n* `InvalidDefinitionException` if no injectable values configured\n* `IllegalArgumentException` if no matching value is found form configured ones\n\nWith fix for #3072 things are being improved (see #5131) but exception types remain as above.\nNeither is right:\n\n1. `IllegalArgumentException` is highly unexpected, not being a `JacksonException` (of `JsonMappingException` subtype) (#5131 will change this)\n2. `InvalidDefinitionException` is incorrect since it is not (necessarily) a bad class definition but more likely mismatch between values\n\nSo to correctly indicate actual reason, let's create something like `MissingInjectValueException` to indicate exact nature of failure.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
