for looking at this issue.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I know very little about Jackson internals, but my first thought is this code here https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.12/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/std/JsonNodeDeserializer.java#L391\r\n```java\r\n                if (old instanceof ObjectNode) {\r\n                    JsonNode newValue = updateObject(p, ctxt, (ObjectNode) old);\r\n                    if (newValue != old) {\r\n                        node.set(key, newValue);\r\n

`ObjectNode` only _then_ try to merge, otherwise it can only be a replace as the types are different. \r\nThis would then fall through and get set to a NULL_VALUE at line https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.12/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/std/JsonNodeDeserializer.java#L434\r\n\r\nI've tried this in a debugger by skipping the test on line 391 and it outputs expected results, but because of the TokenParser I'm not sure how to check that the new 'thing' would be an instance of

Also noticed that duplicate detection would misfire for update case. Changed these as well; passes original test, although I would be interested in more testing as `JsonNode` merging test coverage is bit shallow.\r\n\r\nFixed in 2.12 for 2.12.1; slightly concerned about XML use case (since 2.12 had big improvements to `JsonNode`-from-XML use case). No new XML format test failures, but then again testing on that side is bit limited as well.\r\nBut we'll solve XML-related problems if and when they get uncovered.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/779465243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4333548943,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDMzMzU0ODk0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/4333548943","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"eba7b84d276eade44f63aa4df3a8581b770e3402","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/eba7b84d276eade44f63aa4df3a8581b770e3402","created_at":"2021-02-15T21:59:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/780982365","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3056#issuecomment-780982365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3056","id":780982365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MDk4MjM2NQ==","user":{"login":"Stexxen","id":4494301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4494301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen","html_url":"https://github.com/Stexxen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stexxen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-18T01:54:08Z","updated_at":"2021-02-18T01:54:08Z","body":"@cowtowncoder Many thanks for resolving, i was looking at adding test cases to NodeMergeTest but the in the copy I've cloned the ObjectWriter here https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectWriter.java#L177 \r\n\r\nrequires this file https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/cfg/PackageVersion.java.in but cannot due to the .in suffix on the filename.\r\n\r\nWhat purpose does the .in suffix serve?
