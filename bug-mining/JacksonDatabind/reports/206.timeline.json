Use of generic types as root value is discouraged; and type resolution should rarely be a performance bottleneck, esp. so for generic types. So I would want to make sure that this isn't masking some other issue.\nWould it be possible to add a link to use case, or sample code, or just simplified class definition + usage to show what is the problem case?\n\nAs to backporting, branch 2.6 is closed, so no new full releases are planned. So it is unlikely change would be ported.\n\nWith 2.7 I do have concerns about change that could fundamentally break things in various places -- caching can be great for performance, but may also introduce very subtle bugs, especially if bound type parameters accidentally clash (that is, earlier resolution with certain bindings get cached and used for slightly different bindings).

So it's basically using `List<String>` as the type. And there must be some Scala magic in passing that; perhaps `ScalaObjectMapper` has overloaded method to get to `JavaType`.\nI am just trying to figure out how to reproduce so I can measure effects of the change.\n\nNow: given that it is not certain a change would be merge in 2.7, it may make sense for you to concurrently consider a change to explicitly avoid dynamic type resolution. There are at least two ways to do this:\n1. Construct `JavaType` out of `List<String>`, pass `JavaType` (which is fully resolved)\n2. Construct `ObjectReader` using `mapper.readerFor(type)`, where type is resolved and deserializer also resolved -- this will be slightly faster than going via `mapper.readValue()`\n\nthis assumes that type is known statically. Either approach is likely to result in performance improvement over baseline since even with caching there is some overhead from type resolution of root value type.\n\nI'll see if I can figure out easy testing for performance aspects via `jackson-benchmarks` as I'd like to see how much cache can help; there are some parts of resolution that would still occur even with caching.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/228876709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/228925057","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1277#issuecomment-228925057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1277","id":228925057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODkyNTA1Nw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-28T01:37:46Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T01:37:46Z","body":"@plokhotnyuk Quick question; you said \"40x\" slow down, but perhaps you mean \"40%\" (40 percent)?

One more thought here: I think Scala module uses `TypeModifier`, and perhaps that has been implemented particularly inefficiently: it gets called once per resolution into `JavaType`.\n\n.... and brief grepping shows that Scala module adds one modifier per type. Ugh. That is VERY inefficient as that would seem to create long linear call chains, without much actual benefit. It seems unlikely that users really benefit from composing modules serializer by serializer; but supporting this modularity adds all kinds of inefficiencies.\n\nSo I am guessing that 40x may actually occur with Scala, and caching in many ways works around Scala module issues more than specific cost of basic type resolution.\n\nThis doesn't mean that caching couldn't be added, but I think I better file an issue for Scala module (I don't maintain it) to address other issues.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/228945545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-28T04:58:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T04:58:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala/issues/268","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala/issues/268/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala/issues/268/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala/issues/268/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala/issues/268","id":162602506,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNjI2MDI1MDY=","number":268,"title":"Performance

My concerns about caching seem to be (alas!) valid: Travis shows failures:\n\nhttps://travis-ci.org/FasterXML/jackson-databind/jobs/141404620\n\nwhich I can not replicate locally. But symptoms suggest that caching of resolved generic type is probably introducing unwanted handlers (`JavaType` can have up to 4 handlers associated type).\nOddly enough 2.7 branch is NOT failing, but I assume it all has to do with order of running tests.\n\nI suspect problem has mostly to do with per-property annotations (like `@JsonDeserialize(using)`, `@JsonSerialize(using)` for value handler, `@JsonTypeInfo` for type handler), but I am not quite sure how those could be attached during type resolution itself -- there are mutators, so a new instance needs to be created.\nBut by adding checks to verify cached instances have no handlers, I can reproduce 2-3 failures for a full test run, locally, so there is a problem to fix regardless.\n\nThere are a few ways to try to tackle this;\n1. Remove caching from generic types (although in theory this could also affect non-generic types, as handlers are associated via properties, it's just that problems much more likely with container types)\n2. Try to see if sharing of global `TypeFactory` might be partially to blame (i.e. create new instance per ObjectMapper, even if no `TypeModifier` registered). Most likely this would just mask problems as it seems plausible\n3. Prevent caching of types with handlers.\n\nApproach (3) seems most sensible in general, although I am tempted to do (1) for 2.7; patch releases should try to minimize the risks, and this seems like something that could cause gnarly very hard to debug problems.\n\nSo I will probably do that: undo fix for 2.7, rewrite it for 2.8.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/229740866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":709534098,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDcwOTUzNDA5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/709534098","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e0e2de6519ffc41da66d3913f8e4b8b47371e45a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/e0e2de6519ffc41da66d3913f8e4b8b47371e45a","created_at":"2016-06-30T18:08:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":709555850,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDcwOTU1NTg1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/709555850","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"369d8aedad433cd4d10e93d2df2ecbe0096180f2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/369d8aedad433cd4d10e93d2df2ecbe0096180f2","created_at":"2016-06-30T18:25:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_even
