investigating an issue, I found that there was different behavior for normal deserializers and key deserializers where deserializing a value as a field works as expected, but as a map key fails with \"not a valid representation: wrong number of arguments\".\n\nA basic example:\n\n``` java\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.*;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.TypeReference;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.util.Map.Entry;\n\nimport static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n\npublic class KeyVsFieldTest {\n    @Test\n    public void deserializeAsField() throws IOException {\n        AsField as_field = new ObjectMapper().readValue(\"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"first.last\\\"}\", AsField.class);\n        assertEquals(as_field.getName()._firstname, \"first\");\n        assertEquals(as_field.getName()._lastname, \"last\");\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void deserializeAsKey() throws IOException {\n        Map<FullName, Double> map =\n            new ObjectMapper().readValue(\"{\\\"first.last\\\": 42}\", new TypeReference<Map<FullName, Double>>() {\n            });\n       /* \n          Fails with: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException: Can not construct Map key of type KeyVsFieldTest$FullName from String \"first.last\": not a valid representation: wrong number of arguments\n at [Source: java.io.StringReader@7113b13f; line: 1, column: 2]\n       */\n\n        Entry<FullName, Double> entry = map.entrySet().iterator().next();\n\n        assertEquals(entry.getKey()._firstname, \"first\");\n        assertEquals(entry.getKey()._lastname, \"last\");\n        assertEquals(entry.getValue().doubleValue(), 42, 0);\n    }\n\n    public static class AsField {\n        private final FullName _name;\n\n        public AsField(@JsonProperty(\"name\") FullName aName) {\n            _name = aName;\n        }\n\n        public FullName getName() {\n            return _name;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static class FullName {\n        private final String _firstname;\n        private final String _lastname;\n\n        private FullName(String firstname, String lastname) {\n            _firstname = firstname;\n            _lastname = lastname;\n        }\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        public static FullName valueOf(String value) {\n            String[] mySplit = value.split(\"\\\\.\");\n            return new FullName(mySplit[0], mySplit[1]);\n        }\n\n        public static FullName valueOf(String firstname, String lastname) {\n            return new FullName(firstname, lastname);\n        }\n\n        @JsonValue\n        @Override\n        public String toString() {\n            return _firstname + \".\" + _lastname;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt looks like this is because in `BasicBeanDescriptor`, `findFactoryMethod` has an incorrect assumption about the contents of `_classInfo.getStaticMethods()`, which will have any method named `valueOf` and static methods annotated with `@JsonCreator`:\n\n``` java\n    @Override\n    public Method findFactoryMethod(Class<?>... expArgTypes)\n    {\n        // So, of all single-arg static methods:\n        for (AnnotatedMethod am : _classInfo.getStaticMethods()) {\n            if (isFactoryMethod(am)) {\n                // And must take one of expected arg types (or supertype)\n                Class<?> actualArgType = am.getRawParameterType(0);\n                for (Class<?> expArgType : expArgTypes) {\n                    // And one that matches what we would pass in\n                    if (actualArgType.isAssignableFrom(expArgType)) {\n                        return am.getAnnotated();\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n```\n\nThis can be worked around by annotating static factory methods not intended to be used as `@JsonCreator`s with `@JsonIgnore`, due to the resolution in `_classInfo.getStaticMethods()`, so is not really urgent.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about the issue!\n\nThanks,\nChris\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1429/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
