But there are some stumbling blocks for the most obvious ways, related to how annotation types work. In a way, it'd be perfect if one could actually simply implement `Annotation`s as interfaces. If so, it would be possible to fully unify handling, by feeding programmatically constructed instances. But as far as I have been able to test the idea, this just won't work. JDK blocks attempts (or at least `javac` does).\nBut with individual annotation types this can be made to work. `@JsonFormat`, for example, has inner class `JsonFormat.Value` that is used to encapsulate information. This is why I filed another issue to see how to start by supporting per-class baseline \"below\" per-property annotations.\nAnd some annotations, like `@JsonIgnoreType`, are trivially simple so the equivalent information may be supported quite easily.\n\nNow, `AnnotationIntrospector` could be one way to inject this baseline information. It would be bit tricky to pass this information (it can't be cleanly stored via `AnnotationIntrospector`, I think).\nSo perhaps better way is to require access at same point, before calling introspectors.\n\nAnother challenge is \"pull vs push\": that is, whether to only allow modules to push settings on registration; or to just register callbacks (similar to `Serializer` / `Deserializers`). Latter is more powerful, since it allows open-ended, on-demand handling; and can be used to support simpler approach as well (via `SimpleModule`).\n\nI will have to think about this bit more. I think that some unified mechanism would make sense; that is, mechanism that can be used for more than one configurable aspect.\nPerhaps format (`@JsonFormat`) and ignorability (`@JsonIgnoreType`) could be first things to configure.\n\n... and then again, combining all the aspects into a single baseline-config object can be problematic for cases where different modules want to modify different aspects. This is probably solvable by letting modules modify config object, either by setters or by \"mutant factories\" (withXxx()), instead of requiring modules to return object instances.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/64067204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/64233864","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/621#issuecomment-64233864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/621","id":64233864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjMzODY0","user":{"login":"tea-dragon","id":2219887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTk4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2219887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon","html_url":"https://github.com/tea-dragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea-dragon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-24T17:52:00Z","updated_at":"2014-11-24T17:52:00Z","body":"For my money, the unifying interface should be `AnnotationIntrospector` (although it may or may not use annotations).

up implementing something bit different: `PropertyConfigOverride` instances, specified for (raw) `Class`es, so that applying (nearly) equivalent behavior to `@JsonIgnoreType`, you'd do:\n\n```

only affects specific type associated.
