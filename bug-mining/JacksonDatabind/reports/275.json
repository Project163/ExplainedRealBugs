I'm seeing an issue where Jackson seems to be trimming string values.  In my case, I'm using a custom deserializer, so I don't know if this happens for all strings or not.\r\n\r\nI tracked the issue down to this line in FromStringDeserializer ~ line 116\r\n\r\nif (text.length() == 0 || (**text = text.trim()**).length() == 0) {\r\n    // 04-Feb-2013, tatu: Usually should become null; but not always\r\n    return _deserializeFromEmptyString();\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the root cause for my issue.  My custom deserializer derives from FromStringDeserializer.  I can work around it, by changing my code to:\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n  protected StringParameter _deserialize(String value, DeserializationContext ctxt)\r\n      throws IOException {\r\n    String newValue = ctxt.getParser().getValueAsString();\r\n    // Do stuff with newValue instead of value\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, seems like this may be worth fixing, since it seems this could cause subtle bugs.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1569/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
