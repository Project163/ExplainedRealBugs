Describe your Issue\n\nA few years ago I wrote a module to register a custom BeanDeserializerModifier that ensures collection-like properties are never null. The intent of using a BeanDeserializerModifier rather than registering specific deserializers was to honor any annotations on the property and any other deserializers registered for the property's type.\r\n```\r\nsetDeserializerModifier(new BeanDeserializerModifier() {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public JsonDeserializer<?> modifyCollectionDeserializer(DeserializationConfig config, CollectionType type, BeanDescription beanDesc, JsonDeserializer<?> deserializer) {\r\n        if (deserializer instanceof StringCollectionDeserializer original) {\r\n            return new RequiredCollectionDeserializer(original, type);\r\n        }\r\n        if (deserializer instanceof CollectionDeserializer original) {\r\n            return new RequiredCollectionDeserializer(original, type);\r\n        }\r\n        return deserializer;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public JsonDeserializer<?> modifyMapDeserializer(DeserializationConfig config, MapType type, BeanDescription beanDesc, JsonDeserializer<?> deserializer) {\r\n        if (deserializer instanceof MapDeserializer original) {\r\n            return new RequiredMapDeserializer(original, type);\r\n        }\r\n        return deserializer;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting with 2.15.0-rc1, these methods are not invoked unless I also change the behavior of ObjectMapper like so.\r\n`mapper.setDefaultSetterInfo(JsonSetter.Value.forValueNulls(Nulls.AS_EMPTY));`\r\n\r\nHowever, this seems to break constructor binding on regular POJOs. I get an InvalidDefinitionException.\r\n`Cannot create empty instance of [simple type, class Foo], no default Creator`\r\n\r\nFoo uses constructor binding and has only one constructor. I have tried annotating this constructor with `@JsonCreator` to no avail. It seems that Jackson is attempting to use setter binding.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for some guidance on how to achieve the same result without asking for a Jackson change. I attempted to identify the actual change that introduced the new behavior but there are 6889 commits in 2.15.0-rc1 so I thought it would be easier to just ask first.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2.14.3     works\r\n2.15.0-rc1 does not\r\n2.16.1     does not\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14794526743,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c5cgUNszwAAAANx0pAX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/14794526743","actor":{"login":"ggrebert","id":1737774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mzc3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1737774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert","html_url":"https://github.com/ggrebert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"186e83151c07909f4778fb52975da8ceefa1fb1a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ggrebert/jackson-databind/commits/186e83151c07909f4778fb52975da8ceefa1fb1a","created_at":"2024-10-22T23:36:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
