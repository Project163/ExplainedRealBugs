that:\r\n1. Record with 1-arg header/constructor:\r\n   - Properties-based creator\r\n2. Record with N-args header/constructor + 1-arg (alternative/custom) constructor:\r\n   - Properties-based creator (for the canonical constructor)\r\n   - Delegating creator (for the alternative/custom constructor)\r\n3. Record with 1-arg header/constructor + `@JsonValue`:\r\n   - Delegating creator\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add test cases to document (and to catch potential future regression) number 3.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: Just found out behaviour number 3 came from #3654.

Jackson 2.12.\r\n\r\nOne common pattern in code on my teams is to use 'alias' types to decorate otherwise primitive value types in APIs and/or for dimensional units to gain compiler support for detecting otherwise subtle programming errors (such as using the wrong unit or passing parameters in the wrong order).\r\n\r\nToday, to do this with Java records, we need to write classes like\r\n```java\r\npublic record Watts(@JsonValue double value) {\r\n    @JsonCreator\r\n    public static Watts of(double value) {\r\n        return new Watts(value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWithout the `@JsonCreator` annotated static method (or similarly trivial but verbose constructor), Jackson produces the error\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot construct instance of `...Watts` \r\n  (although at least one Creator exists): no double/Double-argument constructor/factory method to \r\n  deserialize from Number value (<value>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we could place `@JsonCreator` on record classes and infer use of the single argument default constructor I think it'd cut the boilerplate even more. Alternatively, or in addition, it might be interesting to infer that a record class with a single labeled `@JsonValue` parameter should use the default constructor, allowing us to write either:\r\n```java\r\n@JsonCreator\r\npublic record Watts(@JsonValue int value) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n```java\r\npublic record Watts(@JsonValue int value)

of this change – apologies if this was intentional and I missed it.\r\n\r\n(I also found some other behavioral changes in 2.15, but I assume they are intentional – things that weren't deserializing before are now deserializing.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14794526606,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c5VxfVczwAAAANx0o-O","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/14794526606","actor":{"login":"ggrebert","id":1737774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mzc3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1737774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert","html_url":"https://github.com/ggrebert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c084b8a46ad47a213a474a897a789704abd3a513","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ggrebert/jackson-databind/commits/c084b8a46ad47a213a474a897a789704abd3a513","created_at":"2024-10-22T23:36:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
