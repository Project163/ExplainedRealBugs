The test case is in the attached file http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/attachment/62953/jackson.zip. There you can find class ItemMap with field private Map<String, List<ItemMap>> childItems;. After trying to unmarshall such an object we will catch an exception:\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field \"@class\" (class ItemMap), not marked as ignorable (2 known properties: , \"childItems\", \"value\"])\nat [Source: java.io.StringReader@4cd67e21; line: 1, column: 110](through reference chain: ItemMap[\"childItems\"]->ItemMap[\"@class\"])\nat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException.from(UnrecognizedPropertyException.java:79)\nP.S. In our legacy system we use version 1.9 and 2.1. in the new one, so it will be great to have fixes for both branches.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
