your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nVersion `2.14` deprecated `JsonNode.with(String)` and suggests replacing it with `JsonNode.withObject(String)`. However, this causes problems because `JsonNode.withObject(String)` accepts only expressions, whereas the former method accepts a property. Moreover, `JsonNode.withArray(String)` accepts both property names and expressions, making it quite asymmetric.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMigrating the method would imply in many cases extra work and prepending the \"/\" before every property name in existing calls.\r\nFrom the deprecation message of `JsonNode.with(String)` I would change `myObj.with(myProp)` to `myObj.withObject(myProp)` but that throws an exception, so I have to do `myObj.withObject(\"/\" + myProp)`, which I find unpleasant. Again, `myObj.withArray(myProp)` works just fine without need of change.\r\n\r\n**Usage example**\r\nThe change from `myObj.with(myProp)` to `myObj.withObject(myProp)` should work with property or
