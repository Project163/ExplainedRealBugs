java 16, there are stricter limits on reflection access to the jdk internals. Calling setAccessible on non-public fields/methods in the base JDK classes causes an InaccessbileObjectException to be thrown. One work around seems to be using the --add-opens flag to allow other modules to access the internal modules but this doesnt work for codebases that arent using module (i.e. classes are in the 'unnamed' module). Alternatively, these non-public members can be excluded when configuring the genson builder, but depending on which classes are being serialized/deserialized, this list might be large and could conceivably break if the internal classes are changed\r\n\r\nI looked at the Jackson library and they implemented a change to mitigate this issue by excluding non public fields/methods for classes in the \"java.*\" and \"javax.*\" package.  [See here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3117)\r\n\r\nThe quickest way to implement this would probably be to tweak `VisibilityFilter.isVisible` to exclude non-public members for these internal classes.  That being said, this change would likely break existing behaviour.  I can create a PR to do this but I was wondering if anyone else could comment as to whether they are encountering this issue and whether such a change would be worth
