discussed with @cowtowncoder, i create a dedicated issue instead of comment #574 \n\nif i have my enum like \n\n``` Java\n@JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT)\npublic enum Type { \n [...]\n}\n```\n\nand another entity with a link to my enumeration, i can't override the default `@JsonFormat`. when i serialize an instance of `MyClass` the `Type` field is always serialized as a Object. is it the excepted behavior ?\n\n``` Java\npublic enum MyClass { \n    @JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.STRING)\n    public Type getType()
