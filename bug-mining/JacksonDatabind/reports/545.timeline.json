handle deserialization of Joda objects that were serialized without first registering the JodaModule. Under such a situation, objects containing Joda types would be serialized with Jackson's default serialization behavior which is to use all the object's public getters to inform serialization. This results in rather verbose output, but no errors or warnings logged.\r\nMore critically, the resulting json cannot be deserialized even after registering the JodaModule. Neglecting to register the JodaModule is an easy trap to fall into because doing so was not required in Jackson 1.x, which was a monolith that supported Joda types out of the box. Jackson 2.x was broken out into modules. Anyone serializing objects with Joda types who upgraded to Jackson 2.x without realizing this might have inadvertently serialized and persisted objects which are undeserializable. This fix adds support for deserializing all Joda object types which have been serialized with Jackson's default all-public-getters serializer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-25T18:33:53Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T18:33:53Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2776","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2776/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2776/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2776/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2776","id":645769302,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDU3NjkzMDI=","number":2776,"title":"Explicitly

there:**\r\n\r\nFirst, I've set up a REST Controller using Spring Boot v2.1.6.RELEASE like this:\r\n```\r\n@RestController\r\npublic class RESTController {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        SpringApplication.run(RESTController.class, args);\r\n    }\r\n    @PostMapping(value = \"/receiveDateTime\", consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE)\r\n    public DateTime receiveDateTime(@RequestBody DateTime dateTime){\r\n        return dateTime;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUp above, DateTime is a custom data class for holding a single DateTimeFormatter like so:\r\n```\r\npublic class DateTime {\r\n    private DateTimeFormatter dateTime;\r\n\r\n    public DateTime() {}\r\n\r\n    public DateTimeFormatter getDateTime() {\r\n        return dateTime;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setDateTime(DateTimeFormatter dateTime) {\r\n        this.dateTime = dateTime;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I just have to send a POST request to the /receiveDateTime mapping as I did with those two lines of Python code:\r\n```\r\njson_data = json.dumps({\"timeSent\": \"2020-02-09T21:39:15+01:00\"})\r\nresponse = requests.post(url=\"http://localhost:10000/receiveDateTime\", json=json_data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe response is a 400 error code by the way, looking like that:\r\n```\r\nb'{\"timestamp\":\"2020-02-20T14:35:59.797+0000\",\"status\":400,\"error\":\"Bad Request\",\"message\":\"JSON parse error: Cannot construct instance of

jackson in this commit: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/85c9c8544f0c4f01e88241acc1573746df4f755d#diff-4119ee3f674d1d2c64d16e0118a6cad1277bc30849b60970025af744453158e5R312-R320 and it seems the fix is pretty straightforward, `:jib-core` just needs to explicitly register a JavaTime module when setting up its ObjectMapper rather than relying on the old implicit behaviour to serialize & deserialize Instant types. I'm happy to submit a PR for this.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**:\r\n\r\nIdeally jib-core would work with a variety of different jackson versions, but most importantly latest (2.12.0 at time of writing).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n  1. Clone GoogleContainerTools/jib\r\n  2. update build.gradle to build against jackson 2.12.0\r\n  3. Run `./gradlew :jib-core:test -i` and see existing tests fail, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.google.cloud.tools.jib.builder.steps.BuildAndCacheApplicationLayerStepTest > testRun FAILED\r\n
