and thereby serializing only \"as iterable\" would result in functionality users find essentially wrong.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, there is simple heuristic: if no logical properties are found to allow serialization as POJO, then (and only then) are add-on/tag interfaces like:\r\n\r\n* `Iterator`\r\n* `Iterable`\r\n* `CharSequence`\r\n\r\nused to serialize values according to these interfaces.\r\n\r\nSo what is likely happening is that wrapper types expose at least one \"getter\" method, and as a result they are serialized as POJOs, and not just as `Iterable` collections of things.\r\n\r\nNote, however, that same limitation does not apply to `Collection` or `Map`: these types are taken as the \"primary\" type.\r\n\r\nAs to how the specific problem (of forcing wrapper Iterables to be considered \"just Iterables\"), I am not sure how that could be tackled without breaking other use cases.\r\nOne way could be to add a `MapperFeature` to allow more aggressive introspection of `Iterable`s (and probably `Iterator`s), but that seems like a bit too granular and specific thing to handle as a feature.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/515213578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/515296872","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2390#issuecomment-515296872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2390","id":515296872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTI5Njg3Mg==","user":{"login":"cmercer","id":518611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODYxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/518611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer","html_url":"https://github.com/cmercer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmercer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-26T03:40:47Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T03:40:47Z","body":"Iterables are handled as you say above (and correctly) in the normal/no filter applied cases.\r\nThe key difference here is that Iterable test cases work fine **UNLESS** I apply a filter.

So around line 441 we have:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        if (ser == null) {\r\n            // If we get this far, there were no properties found, so no regular BeanSerializer\r\n            // would be constructed.
