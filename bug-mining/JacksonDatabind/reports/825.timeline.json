of #5319 )\n\nThe `DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_FLOAT_AS_INT` configuration is not respected when deserializing from a `JsonNode` to **`byte` or `short` types** using `TreeTraversingParser`. This issue does NOT affect `int` or `long` types, which work correctly. The feature works correctly for all integral types when deserializing directly from a string or stream.\n\n\n### Version Information\n\n3.0.0\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```java\nimport tools.jackson.databind.DeserializationFeature;\nimport tools.jackson.databind.JsonNode;\nimport tools.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport tools.jackson.databind.json.JsonMapper;\n\npublic class AcceptFloatAsIntBugDemo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        ObjectMapper mapper = JsonMapper.builder()\n            .enable(DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_FLOAT_AS_INT)\n            .build();\n\n        // Test 1: Direct deserialization from string - WORKS\n        System.out.println(\"Test 1: Direct string to byte\");\n        try {\n            byte result = mapper.readValue(\"1.1\", byte.class);\n            System.out.println(\"  ✓ Success: \" + result);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"  ✗ Failed: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        // Test 2: Deserialization from JsonNode to byte - FAILS\n        System.out.println(\"\\nTest 2: JsonNode to byte\");\n        try {\n            JsonNode node = mapper.readTree(\"{\\\"value\\\": 1.1}\");\n            JsonNode valueNode = node.get(\"value\");\n            byte result = mapper.readerFor(byte.class).readValue(valueNode);\n            System.out.println(\"  ✓ Success: \" + result);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"  ✗ Failed: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        // Test 3: JsonNode to short - FAILS\n        System.out.println(\"\\nTest 3: JsonNode to short\");\n        try {\n            JsonNode node = mapper.readTree(\"{\\\"value\\\": 1.1}\");\n            JsonNode valueNode = node.get(\"value\");\n            short result = mapper.readerFor(short.class).readValue(valueNode);\n            System.out.println(\"  ✓ Success: \" + result);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"  ✗ Failed: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        // Test 4: JsonNode to int - WORKS\n        System.out.println(\"\\nTest 4: JsonNode to int\");\n        try {\n            JsonNode node = mapper.readTree(\"{\\\"value\\\": 1.1}\");\n            JsonNode valueNode = node.get(\"value\");\n            int result = mapper.readerFor(int.class).readValue(valueNode);\n            System.out.println(\"  ✓ Success: \" + result);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"  ✗ Failed: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        // Test 5: JsonNode to long - WORKS\n        System.out.println(\"\\nTest 5: JsonNode to long\");\n        try {\n            JsonNode node = mapper.readTree(\"{\\\"value\\\": 1.1}\");\n            JsonNode valueNode = node.get(\"value\");\n            long result = mapper.readerFor(long.class).readValue(valueNode);\n            System.out.println(\"  ✓ Success: \" + result);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"  ✗ Failed: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        // Test 6: Workaround - convert JsonNode to string first - WORKS\n        System.out.println(\"\\nTest 6: JsonNode -> String -> byte (workaround)\");\n        try {\n            JsonNode node = mapper.readTree(\"{\\\"value\\\": 1.1}\");\n            JsonNode valueNode = node.get(\"value\");\n            byte result = mapper.readerFor(byte.class).readValue(valueNode.toString());\n            System.out.println(\"  ✓ Success: \" + result);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"  ✗ Failed: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAll the tests work, but actual output is\n```\nTest 1: Direct string to byte\n  ✓ Success: 1\n\nTest 2: JsonNode to byte\n  ✗ Failed: Numeric value (1.1) of `DoubleNode` has fractional part;

cannot convert to `int`\n at [No location information]\n        at tools.jackson.core.base.ParserMinimalBase._constructInputCoercion(ParserMinimalBase.java:1130)\n        at tools.jackson.databind.node.TreeTraversingParser.getIntValue(TreeTraversingParser.java:303)\n        at tools.jackson.core.base.ParserMinimalBase.getByteValue(ParserMinimalBase.java:576)\n        at tools.jackson.databind.deser.std.StdDeserializer._parseBytePrimitive(StdDeserializer.java:527)\n        at tools.jackson.databind.deser.jdk.NumberDeserializers$ByteDeserializer.deserialize(NumberDeserializers.java:259)\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue appears to be in `TreeTraversingParser.getIntValue()` which doesn't check or respect the `ACCEPT_FLOAT_AS_INT` feature when reading from numeric nodes. The error message reveals the problem:\n\n```\nNumeric value (1.1) of `DoubleNode` has fractional part; cannot convert to `int`\n```\n\nNotice it says **\"cannot convert to `int`\"** even when deserializing to `byte` or `short`. The stack trace shows:\n\n```\nat tools.jackson.databind.node.TreeTraversingParser.getIntValue(TreeTraversingParser.java:303)\nat tools.jackson.core.base.ParserMinimalBase.getByteValue(ParserMinimalBase.java:576)\n```\n\nThe methods `getByteValue()` and `getShortValue()` internally call `getIntValue()` first, which validates that the number can be converted to an exact integral value **without checking the `ACCEPT_FLOAT_AS_INT` feature**.\n\nBy contrast, deserialization to `int` and `long` appears to have proper feature checking, which is why those work correctly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
