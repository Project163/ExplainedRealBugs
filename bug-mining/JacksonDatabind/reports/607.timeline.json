[USE_BASE_TYPE_AS_DEFAULT_IMPL not working with DefaultTypeResolverBuilder](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3235) #3235 \r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nIssue mainly caused by variable `_defaultImpl` is a shared in [`StdTypeResolverBuilder$defineDefaultImpl`](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.12/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/jsontype/impl/StdTypeResolverBuilder.java#L145).\r\ndefaultImpl will be setted only if previous value is null. In [BasicDeserializerFactory](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.12/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/BasicDeserializerFactory.java#L1797)\r\n```java\r\n        if ((b.getDefaultImpl() == null) && baseType.isAbstract()) {\r\n            JavaType defaultType = mapAbstractType(config, baseType);\r\n            if ((defaultType != null) && !defaultType.hasRawClass(baseType.getRawClass())) {\r\n                b = b.defaultImpl(defaultType.getRawClass());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nSo,  a newly constructed instance is returned if _defaultImpl is given a new value.\r\n\r\n**Other ways to fix this issue:**\r\n1. Change method `buildTypeDeserializer` in interface `TypeResolverBuilder`, adding `defaultImpl` as a method arg. this way will lead too many places need to be changed.\r\n2. remove if condition `defaultType != null` in `BasicDeserializerFactory`. Because they will run in `synchronized` block, this will be ok in most cases. But default `TypeResolverBuilder` is a shared instance, may lead to bugs hard to find&fix.\r\n3. move `mapAbstractType` to `TypeResolverBuilder`. ** May be this is the correct way.**, but changes is too big.
