Fun times! There are multiple ways to tackle this one.\r\n\r\nFor example: we could prevent serialization of `processor` altogether. Easiest would be to rename `getProcessor()` into non-getter method. This is actually being done in Jackson 3.0.\r\nBut we can't do that in 2.x for backwards compatibility, just in case someone might be using the method.\r\n\r\nSo we could remove that property for `JacksonException` types in `BeanSerializerFactory`. Possible but bit messy.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could -- and I did -- change serialization of processor types; I made them serialize as empty JSON Objects for now.\r\nThere are variations here: could f.ex serialize as JSON String (class name). That might be useful, but if this property is removed from 3.0 it seems better idea not to add more information.\r\n\r\nSo, for 2.13 I plan on going with changing serialization, and working around the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/912214051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T17:32:06Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T17:32:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3302","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3302/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3302/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3302/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3302","id":1027653526,"node_id":"I_kwDOAC5e2c49QL-W","number":3302,"title":"Serialize

actual changes were done as part of fix for #3244  - this is for documenting side effects)\r\n\r\nWith Jackson 2.x up to 2.12 a few central processing entities are not serializable by Jackson itself: they cannot be deserialized due to state, and sometimes contain problematic things like cyclic references, resulting in various Exceptions or even errors (like `StackOverflowError`) being thrown.\r\n\r\nBut while they cannot be deserialized there is no reason why they could not be serialized using a placeholder value like Empty Object (`{ }` in case of JSON).\r\nSo let's do that for following types (and their subtypes)\r\n\r\n* `ObjectMapper` (and format-specific subtypes)\r\n* `ObjectReader`\r\n* `ObjectWriter`\r\n* `DatabindContext` (subtypes `SerializerProvider`, `DeserializationContext`)\r\n* `TokenStreamFactory` (subtypes `JsonFactory` etc)\r\n* `JsonParser` (and format-specific subtypes)\r\n* `JsonGenerator` (and format-specific
