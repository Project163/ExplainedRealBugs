trying to protect against now that `DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION` is set to `false`.\n\n`FAIL_ON_UNEXPECTED_VIEW_PROPERTIES` Javadoc says:\n> It enhances the robustness of data binding by ensuring that only the properties relevant to the active view are considered during deserialization, thereby preventing unintended data from being processed.\n\nLooks like we already getting that security by switching
