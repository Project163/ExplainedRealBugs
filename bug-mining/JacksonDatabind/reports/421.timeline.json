just updated from Jackson (databind) 2.9.7 to 2.10.0 as a part of updating from Spring Boot 2.1.x to 2.2. In my project I depend on [jackson-dataformat-hal](https://github.com/openapi-tools/jackson-dataformat-hal) to generate responses to web requests. After the update to Jackson 2.10 I get the following exception when trying to serialize a field of type `BigDecimal`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: null\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.NumberSerializer$BigDecimalAsStringSerializer.valueToString(NumberSerializer.java:161)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.NumberSerializer$BigDecimalAsStringSerializer.isEmpty(NumberSerializer.java:132)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanPropertyWriter.serializeAsField(BeanPropertyWriter.java:711)\r\n\tat io.openapitools.jackson.dataformat.hal.ser.HALBeanSerializer$FilteredProperties.serialize(HALBeanSerializer.java:191)\r\n\t... 120 common frames omitted\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I have a look at `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.NumberSerializer$BigDecimalAsStringSerializer.valueToString`it looks like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic String valueToString(Object value) {\r\n    // should never be called\r\n    throw new IllegalStateException();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this method seems to be called from `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.NumberSerializer$BigDecimalAsStringSerializer.isEmpty(NumberSerializer.java:132)` just as the exception implies:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic boolean isEmpty(SerializerProvider prov, Object value) {\r\n    return valueToString(value).isEmpty();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe call to `BeanPropertyWriter.serializeAsField(..)` in [jackson-dataformat-hal](https://github.com/openapi-tools/jackson-dataformat-hal) looks like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor (BeanPropertyWriter prop : state) {\r\n    try {\r\n        prop.serializeAsField(bean, jgen, provider);\r\n    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        wrapAndThrow(provider, e, bean, prop.getName());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `jgen` is a `JsonGenerator ` and `provider` is a `SerializerProvider` from Jackson 2.10. \r\n\r\nCould this be a bug in Jackson Databind or is there something else going on?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2513/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
