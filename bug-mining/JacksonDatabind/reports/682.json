The API documentation says:\r\n\r\n> Use {@link #forType(Class)} instead\r\n\r\nHowever `ObjectReader.forType(Class<?> valueType)` is not a direct replacement, as not all `Type` instances are `Class` instances.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say I want to unmashal some JSON to match the type of a method parameter. (This follows some [discussion](https://github.com/FasterXML/java-classmate/issues/69#issuecomment-1755784169) on FasterXML/java-classmate#69.) With the deprecated method I could do this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nType parameter1Type = method.getGenericParameterTypes()[0];\r\nObjectReader typeAwareObjectReader = objectReader.withType(parameter1Type);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now that the method `ObjectReader.withType(java.lang.reflect.Type valueType)` is deprecated and going away, I'll have to do this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nType parameter1Type = method.getGenericParameterTypes()[0];\r\nJavaType parameter1JavaType = objectReader.getConfig().getTypeFactory().constructType(parameter1Type);\r\nObjectReader typeAwareObjectReader = objectReader.forType(parameter1JavaType);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn extra step with no benefit of doing it manually. (It is included as part of the deprecated `ObjectReader.withType(java.lang.reflect.Type valueType)`.)\r\n\r\nIs there any reason not to have an `ObjectReader.forType(java.lang.reflect.Type valueType)` like the one that is going away, just with this better name?","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
