have an abstract super class annotated with\n\n```\n@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = \"type\")\n```\n\nwhere `type` is an existing property of the class.\n\nThe full class hierarchy looks like this:\n\n``` java\n@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = \"type\")\n@JsonSubTypes({\n                      @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = SubClassA.class, name = \"a\"),\n                      @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = SubClassB.class, name = \"b\")\n              })\npublic abstract class AbstractSuperClass {\n    @Transient\n    private String type;\n\n    protected AbstractSuperClass() {\n        setType(getTypeValue());\n    }\n    protected abstract String getTypeValue();\n\n    // getters and setters\n}\n\npublic class SubClassA extends AbstractSuperClass {\n    private double a;\n\n    public SubClassA(double a) {\n        this.a = a;\n    }\n\n    // getters and setters\n\n    @Override\n    protected String getTypeValue() {\n        return \"a\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SubClassB extends AbstractSuperClass {\n\n    private int b;\n\n    public SubClassB(int b) {\n        this.b = b;\n    }\n\n    // getters and setters\n\n    @Override\n    protected String getTypeValue() {\n        return \"b\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow when a SubClass of this class gets serialised, the `type` is added twice to the generated JSON. E.g. the JSON for a SubClassB would look like this:\n\n``` json\n{\"type\":\"b\",\"type\":\"b\",\"b\":42}\n```\n\nFor the most part this does not seem to be an issue, but some clients (e.g. [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop)) refuse this as `Malformed JSON`.\n\nI know I could add e.g. `@JsonTypeId` or `@JsonIgnore` but in that case, `type` will **not** be included in generated JSON when using a `List<AbstractSuperClass>`, which is what I **definitely** need.\n\nI assume that `include = JsonTypeInfo.As.EXISTING_PROPERTY` would solve my problem but this results in `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Do not know how to construct standard type serializer for inclusion type: EXISTING_PROPERTY`\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/528/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
