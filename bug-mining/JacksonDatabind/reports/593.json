While this does not cause many breakages so far (based on unit tests), it does seem like there are cases where unnecessary access attempts are made on some JDK types.\r\n\r\nOne way to reduce these cases would to make default visibility (see `@JsonAutoDetect`) settings bit stricter for JDK types (as defined by class being under \"java.\" or \"javax.\" packages): specifically, to require \"public\" visibility for accessors including setters.\r\nThis should help reduce access attempts that are not really needed but that may lead to failures.\r\n\r\nBeyond this it will probably make sense to also prevent calls to \"setAccessible()\" for members of same types, but first things first.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
