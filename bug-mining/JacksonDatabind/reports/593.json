am using jackson-databind:2.11.1, for some special reason, I must provide multiple compatible setters, I got failed with the following case:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Data {\r\n    // the value is the index of EnumValue\r\n    private Integer value;\r\n\r\n    public enum EnumValue {\r\n        EV1, EV2, EV3\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getValue() {\r\n        return EnumValue.values()[value].name();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setValue(Integer value) {\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n    public void setValue(EnumValue value) {\r\n        this.value = value.ordinal();\r\n    }\r\n    public void setValue(String value) {\r\n        this.value = EnumValue.valueOf(value).ordinal();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String toString() {\r\n

      Data data = new Data();\r\n        data.setValue(EnumValue.EV3);\r\n\r\n        String str = mapper.writeValueAsString(data);\r\n        System.out.println(str);\r\n\r\n        Data a2 = mapper.readValue(str, Data.class);\r\n        System.out.print(a2);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry a few more times,  sometimes it works fine, and sometimes it throws IllegalArgumentException (Conflicting setter definitions for property).\r\n\r\nI have read this part of the source code, the course is probably in the POJOPropertyBuilder.getSetter() method. It seems prefer to the setter with String parameter, and can choose the right one (the one with String parameter) when there are 2 or less setters. In my case, there are 3, If the setter with String parameter is not first two, the exception will be thrown. but it seems that, the order of setters are indeterminate.\r\n\r\nI've found a similar issue here https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2741, but it was a different case.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
