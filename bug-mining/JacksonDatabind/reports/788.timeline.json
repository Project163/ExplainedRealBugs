See https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4533 for another solution with Jackson 2.19.0\n\n-----\n\nI'm using the jackson-datatype-jsr310 module in my (spring) application. The issue occurs with any version over 2.11.4. I have simplified the issue:\nPOJO:\n\n```\nimport java.time.OffsetDateTime;\n\npublic class Pojo {\n    OffsetDateTime aDateTime;\n\n    public OffsetDateTime getaDateTime() {\n        return aDateTime;\n    }\n\n    public void setaDateTime(OffsetDateTime aDateTime) {\n        this.aDateTime = aDateTime;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nApplication:\n\n```\n@SpringBootApplication\npublic class OffsetTimeTestApplication {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SpringApplication.run(OffsetTimeTestApplication.class, args);\n    }\n\n    public OffsetTimeTestApplication() {\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n        Pojo pojo = new Pojo();\n        pojo.setaDateTime(Instant.now().atOffset(ZoneOffset.UTC));\n        try {\n            System.out.println(\"output: \" + mapper.writeValueAsString(pojo));\n        } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nRelevant section of build.gradle:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter'\n    implementation group: 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core', name: 'jackson-core', version: '2.12.3'\n    implementation group: 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core', name: 'jackson-annotations', version: '2.12.3'\n    implementation group: 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core', name: 'jackson-databind', version: '2.12.3'\n    implementation group: 'com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype', name: 'jackson-datatype-jsr310', version: '2.12.3'\n```\n\nStacktrace:\n\n```\n2021-06-01 10:27:14.724  INFO 235160 --- [  restartedMain] .e.DevToolsPropertyDefaultsPostProcessor : Devtools property defaults active!
