Having @JsonAlias available for this purpose can help to avoid bloat-code or custom de-serializers that do this.\r\n\r\n**Current behaviour**\r\nNot implemented.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\nI'd assume the same behaviour as with class members applies. So using @JsonProperty and @JsonAlias combined would yield the same result except for values not keys.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic enum MyEnum{\r\n    @JsonProperty(\"stringvalue\") //<- Value Jackson should use during serialization and de-serialization.\r\n    @JsonAlias({\"stringValue\"}) //<- Additional value, valid only during de-serialization.\r\n    STRING_VALUE //<- Would assume \"string_value\" is ignored and not added to the list of valid values\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Extra information**\r\nVersion: 2.9\r\nOccurs in patch: Yes\r\nFeature request was also mentioned in: [this issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1988#issuecomment-380308586) (Couldn't find the accompanying Feature request)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2352/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2352/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
