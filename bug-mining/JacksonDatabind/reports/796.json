Please describe.\n\nWith Jackson 3, Spring Framework 7 is switching to using the Jackson support for service loader to enable Jackson modules by default. It would be very useful for us to have a `MapperBuilder#findAndAddModules(ClassLoader)` along to the current `MapperBuilder#findAndAddModules()` shortcut to promote this as a first class use case within the Spring portfolio. Any chance you could add it?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe would like to be be able to write:\n```java\npublic MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter() {\n    this(JsonMapper.builder()\n            .findAndAddModules(MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter.class.getClassLoader())\n            .build());\n}\n```\n\nInstead of:\n```java\npublic MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter() {\n    this(JsonMapper.builder()\n            .addModules(MapperBuilder.findModules(MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter.class.getClassLoader()))\n            .build());\n}\n```\n\n### Usage example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
