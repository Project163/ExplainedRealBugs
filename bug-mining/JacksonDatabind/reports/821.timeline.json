The user applies an `@Encrypted` annotation to the field they want encrypted/decrypted during serialization/deserialization.\n\nAt this point you might be thinking the module can just call `getAnnotation(Encrypted.class)`, but there's a complication.\n\nThis annotation has an attribute that specifies the encryption key to use. Rather than requiring the end user to specify the encryption key every time the annotation is applied, the module lets the user define their own annotation that _doesn't_ require the user to specify the key. To do this, the module supports `@Encrypted` being used as a meta-annotation; in other words, it can be applied to _other_ annotations so the other annotation \"inherits\" the properties of the `@Encrypted` annotation. (This \"inheritance\" is not a language feature, but rather a convention that requires using reflection to find the meta-annotation.)\n\nPseudocode for the simplified version of this custom annotation might look like this:\n\n```\n@Encrypted(key = \"super-secret-key\")\npublic @interface SuperSecret\n```\n\nThis lets the user annotate their POJOs with their custom `@SuperSecret` annotation and not have to worry about specifying the key name each time.\n\nNow let's think about how the Jackson module finds the `@Encrypted` annotation. If it calls `getAnnotation(Encrypted.class)` it won't find it, because this annotation is not present on the field. Instead it needs to somehow get the `@SuperSecret` annotation so it can inspect it and find the `@Encrypted` annotation on `@SuperSecret`.\n\nSo the module just needs to call `getAnnotation(SuperSecret.class)`, right? Unfortunately it can't, because the module doesn't know about the `SuperSecret` annotation -- it's a custom annotation created by the user of the module.\n\nWhat the module _can_ do it ask for _all_ annotations, and scan them to see if any annotations are themselves annotated with `@Encrypted`.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/3165646781/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dnault","id":9012551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTI1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9012551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault","html_url":"https://github.com/dnault","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnault/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/3166169224","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5244#issuecomment-3166169224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5244","id":3166169224,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c68t-iI","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-07T23:56:19Z","updated_at":"2025-08-07T23:56:19Z","body":"Ah ok.

Search before asking\r\n\r\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nSSIA\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n2.16.0\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe following is a sample using `InjectableValues` that is made to count up when `findInjectableValue` is called.\r\nSince it is deserialized only once, the first ID is expected, but it is actually the second ID.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JacksonInject;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.*;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Arrays;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport java.util.UUID;\r\n\r\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;\r\n\r\npublic class JacksonInjectForFieldTest {\r\n    static class Dto {\r\n        @JacksonInject(\"uuid\")\r\n        private final UUID uuid;\r\n\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        Dto(\r\n                // @JacksonInject(\"uuid\")\r\n                @JsonProperty(\"uuid\")\r\n                UUID uuid\r\n        ) {\r\n            this.uuid = uuid;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    List<UUID> ids = Arrays.asList(UUID.randomUUID(), UUID.randomUUID());\r\n    class MyInjectableValues extends InjectableValues.Std {\r\n        int count = 0; // count up if injected\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Object findInjectableValue(\r\n                Object valueId,\r\n                DeserializationContext ctxt,\r\n

ids.get(count++);\r\n            } else {\r\n                return super.findInjectableValue(valueId, ctxt, forProperty, beanInstance);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n

    Dto dto = reader.readValue(\"{}\");\r\n        UUID actual = dto.uuid;\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(ids);\r\n        System.out.println(ids.get(0) == actual);\r\n        System.out.println(ids.get(1) == actual);\r\n\r\n        assertEquals(ids.get(0), actual);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe inject process is executed only once.\r\nIn fact, if a specification is made for a parameter, the result is as expected.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n> After processing in the creator, another injection is performed on the field, so it is called twice in total.\r\n\r\nI commented but forgot to mention the above initially.\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4218#issuecomment-1826461447","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-22T04:13:52Z","updated_at":"2025-08-22T04:13:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2678","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2678/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2678/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2678/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2678","id":593818856,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTM4MTg4NTY=","number":2678,"title":"`@JacksonInject`

have problem when using `@JacksonInject` on `final` field that is initialized using constructor (see the whole example at the end of the message).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the correct value from JSON is used when the constructor is called, see the stacktrace:\r\n```\r\nAnnotatedConstructor.call(Object[]) line: 124\t\r\nStdValueInstantiator.createFromObjectWith(DeserializationContext, Object[]) line: 283\t\r\nStdValueInstantiator(ValueInstantiator).createFromObjectWith(DeserializationContext, SettableBeanProperty[], PropertyValueBuffer) line: 229\t\r\nPropertyBasedCreator.build(DeserializationContext, PropertyValueBuffer) line: 195\t\r\nBeanDeserializer._deserializeUsingPropertyBased(JsonParser, DeserializationContext) line: 422\t\r\nBeanDeserializer(BeanDeserializerBase).deserializeFromObjectUsingNonDefault(JsonParser, DeserializationContext) line: 1287\t\r\nBeanDeserializer.deserializeFromObject(JsonParser, DeserializationContext) line: 326\t\r\nBeanDeserializer.deserialize(JsonParser, DeserializationContext) line: 159\t\r\nObjectMapper._readMapAndClose(JsonParser, JavaType) line: 4013\t\r\nObjectMapper.readValue(String, Class<T>) line: 3004\t\r\nJacksonInjectTest.testReadValueInjectables()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut later this value is overrided by the default value of the injectable (but `useInput` is `OptBoolean.TRUE`) because `_injectables != null` at `BeanDeserializer.deserialize(JsonParser, DeserializationContext, Object) line: 216`, full stacktrace:\r\n```\r\nAnnotatedField.setValue(Object, Object) line: 105\t\r\nValueInjector.inject(DeserializationContext, Object) line: 51\t\r\nBeanDeserializer(BeanDeserializerBase).injectValues(DeserializationContext, Object) line: 1520\t\r\nBeanDeserializer.deserialize(JsonParser, DeserializationContext, Object) line: 217\t\r\nBeanDeserializer._deserializeUsingPropertyBased(JsonParser, DeserializationContext) line: 441\t\r\nBeanDeserializer(BeanDeserializerBase).deserializeFromObjectUsingNonDefault(JsonParser, DeserializationContext) line: 1287\t\r\nBeanDeserializer.deserializeFromObject(JsonParser, DeserializationContext) line: 326\t\r\nBeanDeserializer.deserialize(JsonParser, DeserializationContext) line:

happens even if I set `mapper.configure(MapperFeature.ALLOW_FINAL_FIELDS_AS_MUTATORS, false);` which is weired.\r\n\r\nHere is the whole example:\r\n```java\r\npackage com.drooms.semantic.flink.jobs;\r\n\r\nimport static java.util.Objects.requireNonNull;\r\nimport static org.testng.Assert.assertEquals;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\n\r\nimport

{\r\n\t\t\treturn field2;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tpublic void testReadValueInjectables() throws JsonParseException, JsonMappingException, IOException {\r\n\t\tfinal ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\t\tfinal InjectableValues injectableValues =\r\n\t\t\t\tnew InjectableValues.Std().addValue(\"defaultValueForField2\", \"somedefaultValue\");\r\n\t\tmapper.setInjectableValues(injectableValues);\r\n\r\n\t\tfinal Some actualValueMissing = mapper.readValue(\"{\\\"field1\\\": \\\"field1value\\\"}\", Some.class);\r\n\t\tassertEquals(actualValueMissing.getField1(), \"field1value\");\r\n\t\tassertEquals(actualValueMissing.getField2(), \"somedefaultValue\");\r\n\r\n\t\tfinal Some actualValuePresent =\r\n\t\t\t\tmapper.readValue(\"{\\\"field1\\\": \\\"field1value\\\", \\\"field2\\\": \\\"field2value\\\"}\", Some.class);\r\n\t\tassertEquals(actualValuePresent.getField1(), \"field1value\");\r\n\t\tassertEquals(actualValuePresent.getField2(), \"somedefaultValue\");\r\n\t\t// if I comment @JacksonInject that is next to the property the valid assert is the correct one:\r\n\t\t// assertEquals(actualValuePresent.getField2(), \"field2value\");\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my original case I'm using lombok to generate the constructor and the annotation is copied from property to the constructor parameter (you can check it here: https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/1528#issuecomment-607725333 ). You can check https://stackoverflow.com/a/60987798/2054634 for more information on the context of the problem.\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm using jackson v. 2.9.6\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nPlamen","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
