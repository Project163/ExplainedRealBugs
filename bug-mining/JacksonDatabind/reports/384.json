Going up to 1.9.5 the same problem still persists for us.\r\n\r\nI was able to track this back to a change in issue #1604 where I've commented earlier. I'm opening a new issue as suggested there, but this problem could be connected to #1964.\r\n\r\nI've isolated our problem into a simple maven based project, you can find it here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dnno/jackson-serialization-problem/\r\n\r\nThe classes we try to serialize make use of generics and Jackson now isn't able to handle them anymore. Type resolution stops here:\r\n\r\nTypeFactory._verifyAndResolvePlaceholders():476\r\n\r\nif (exp.getRawClass() != act.getRawClass()) {  \r\n    return false;  \r\n}\r\n\r\nI don't really understand a lot of what's happening here, but what I do see is, that if I manually set the resulting error String to , the serialization will work fine.\r\n\r\nCould it be, that it's wrong to just compare for the same raw classes, but instead traverse the type hierarchy? In my case it's comparing a List (actual) to an Object (expected). A successful comparison would make sense for me.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
