These classes are not public / do not have proper publicly accessible ctors/etc, hence jackson cannot perform the logic without calling `AccessibleObject.setAccessible(true)`. Since it happens in clinit(), the whole library is unusable without granting this permission.\n\nIMO, this is a very serious bug. This situation makes it nearly impossible to properly protect confidential data (such as AWS credentials) in any app using the library, because it means `private` fields are no longer private, and so on. \n\nTo hack around this bug in elasticsearch, we have to grant this horrible permission to our AWS plugins, and then use the following hack in all AWS plugins to try to contain the damage:\n\n```\nstatic {\n        // This internal config is deserialized but with wrong access modifiers,\n        // cannot work without suppressAccessChecks permission right now. We force\n        // a one time load with elevated privileges as a workaround.\n        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();\n        if (sm != null) {\n            sm.checkPermission(new SpecialPermission());\n        }\n        AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Void>() {\n            @Override\n            public Void run() {\n                try {\n                    Class.forName(\"com.amazonaws.internal.config.InternalConfig$Factory\");\n                } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\n                    throw new RuntimeException(\"Unable to initialize internal aws config\", e);\n                }\n                return null;\n            }\n        });\n    }\n```\n\nPersonally, I don't see the need for fancy serialization here at all: a simple .properties file or similar could remove a ton of classes here, and possibly a 3rd-party library dependency on a popular library (jackson-databind) which would reduce jar hell for users of this library. That is how I would solve it.\n\nOtherwise, at least set the access modifiers on all these classes/ctors/etc to be correct (public). By requiring `suppressAccessChecks` it means everything is effectively public.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/528/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-29T17:30:22Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T17:30:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/24374","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/24374/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/24374/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/24374/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/24374","id":1008459356,"node_id":"PR_kwDOACyxNM4sVDOp","number":24374,"title":"Provide

It works in most cases but sometimes, fe. when application runs under `SecurityManager` and needs to use reflection, it is not sufficient and using custom `SerializerAdapter` would be very helpful. The underlying `AzureBlobStorageImpl` already supports that however the ability to pass the `SerializerAdapter` instance down the chain of builders is not supported.\r\n\r\nThe PR provides a way for the `XxxBlob` client builders to allow using user-provided SerializerAdapter instance. The change is low risk (arguably) and does not break an existing APIs.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/24373.\r\nThank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/24374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/24374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
