to deserialize a JSON string using jackson-databind Objectmapper which has a set of Enum attributes within it, but ends up in InvalidFormatException. \r\n\r\nThis happens when an unknown attribute, which is not defined in the enum comes in the JSON. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n    ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n    objectMapper.setVisibility(PropertyAccessor.ALL, Visibility.NONE);\r\n    objectMapper.setVisibility(PropertyAccessor.FIELD, Visibility.ANY);\r\n    objectMapper.setSerializationInclusion(Include.NON_NULL);\r\n   objectMapper.configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, deserialization (objectMapper.readValue(jsonText, .class);) throws an  error. \"Test\" is the unknown attribute that comes in the JSON String to be deserialized.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException: Cannot deserialize Map key of type com..* from String \"Test\": not a valid representation, problem:(com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException) Cannot deserialize Map key of type com.... from String \"Test\": not one of values excepted for Enum class: [ ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample of JSON String would look like this.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString jsonText=\"{\\\"cartId\\\":\\\"31028\\\",\\\"userId\\\":\\\"106784\\\",\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"count\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"amount\\\":\\\"10\\\",\\\"email\\\":\\\"N\\\",\\\"Test\\\":\\\"No\\\",\\\"phone\\\":\\\"N\\\"}}\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe JSON maps to a Cart class, which holds these attributes as a Map. \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Cart {\r\n  private String cartId;\r\n  private String userId;\r\n  private Map<Attributes,String> attributes;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttributes map to the Enum, as given below.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic enum Attributes {\r\n  Count(0),\r\n  Amount(1),\r\n  Email(2),\r\n  Phone(3);\r\n\r\n  private final int value;\r\n  private Attributes(int value) {\r\n    this.value = value;\r\n  }\r\n  public int getValue() {\r\n    return value;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso tried adding this configuration \r\n\r\n    objectMapper.configure(DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_AS_NULL, true);\r\n\r\nThis resulted in the Unknown attribute key to be deserialized as null. (i.e., instead of Test=No, it gets deserialized as null=No). So, when a new attribute - say, 'Test' comes in the Json, it would be good if the mapper can ignore that field and proceed with de-serializing the remaining fields that has a match in the Enum, rather than throwing the exception.\r\n\r\n  ","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1859/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
