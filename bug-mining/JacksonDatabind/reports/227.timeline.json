:):\n- Removing `@JsonUnwrapped` from the mixin\n- Removing `getNested()` from the mixin entirely\n- Not registering the mixin\n- Adding `suppressConstructorProperties = true` to `@AllArgsConstructor` on `Foo`.\n\nSo it looks like that the \"override\" of the accessor in the mixin has a higher priority than the constructor that's generated by default Lombok. However, tricking Lombok into not adding the explicit constructor argument annotations seems to resolve the issue, too.\n\nThe error appears on 2.7.4, 2.6.5 works fine. Originally I thought I run into something related to #1122, but that one was resolved in 2.7.4.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1239/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jmoney","id":1157041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTcwNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1157041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-30T14:07:33Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T14:07:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/1755","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/1755/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/1755/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/1755/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/1755","id":180312366,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0ODc0OTk4NjQ=","number":1755,"title":"Update

for a creator property instead of treating it like a delegate creator.\n\nIn this example there is no property with the implied name.  As a gist, see [here](https://gist.github.com/david-bakin/9feb4fdb07c0abc94276), which actually has two problems in it.  This is the problem with class D:\n\n``` java\npackage com.bakin_bits;\n\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\nimport org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.EqualsBuilder;\nimport org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder;\nimport org.testng.annotations.Test;\n\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonValue;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.module.paramnames.ParameterNamesModule;\n\npublic class TestJacksonModuleParameterNames\n{\n\n    public static class D\n    {\n        private final String raw1;\n        private final String raw2;\n\n        private D(String raw1, String raw2) {\n            this.raw1 = raw1;\n            this.raw2 = raw2;\n        }\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        public static D make(String value) {\n            String[] split = value.split(\":\");\n            return new D(split[0], split[1]);\n        }\n\n        @JsonValue\n        public String getMyValue() {\n            return raw1 + \":\" + raw2;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n            if (null == obj)\n                return false;\n            if (this == obj)\n                return true;\n            if (this.getClass() != obj.getClass())\n                return false;\n\n            D rhs = (D) obj;\n            return new EqualsBuilder().append(this.raw1, rhs.raw1).append(this.raw2, rhs.raw2).isEquals();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public int hashCode() {\n            return new HashCodeBuilder().append(this.raw1).append(this.raw2).toHashCode();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public String toString() {\n            return getMyValue();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Test(enabled = true)\n    public void D_delegate_based_creator_without_parameter_names_module() throws IOException {\n        // ARRANGE\n        ObjectMapper sut = new ObjectMapper();\n\n        D d = D.make(\"abc:def\");\n\n        // ACT\n        String actualJson = sut.writeValueAsString(d);\n        D actualD = sut.readValue(actualJson, D.class);\n\n        // ASSERT\n        assertThat(actualJson).isEqualTo(\"\\\"abc:def\\\"\");\n        assertThat(actualD).isEqualTo(d);\n    }\n\n    @Test(enabled = true)\n    public void D_delegate_based_creator_with_parameter_names_module() throws IOException {\n        // ARRANGE\n        ObjectMapper sut = new ObjectMapper();\n        sut.registerModule(new ParameterNamesModule());\n\n        D d = D.make(\"abc:def\");\n\n        // ACT\n        String actualJson = sut.writeValueAsString(d);\n        D actualD = sut.readValue(actualJson, D.class);\n\n        // ASSERT\n        assertThat(actualJson).isEqualTo(\"\\\"abc:def\\\"\");\n        assertThat(actualD).isEqualTo(d);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nStack trace looks like this:\n\n``````\nFAILED: D_delegate_based_creator_with_parameter_names_module\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Could not find creator property with name 'value' (in class com.bakins_bits.TestJacksonModuleParameterNames$D)\n at [Source: \"abc:def\";
