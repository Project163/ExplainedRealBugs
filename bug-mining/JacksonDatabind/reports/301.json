with Jackson release `2.9.0.pr1` deserialization of `@JsonAnySetter` fails when `ParameterNamesModule` is registered.\r\n\r\nThe following sample demonstrates the problem:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\napply plugin: 'java'\r\n\r\next {\r\n\tjacksonVersion = '2.9.0.pr4'\r\n}\r\n\r\nrepositories {\r\n\tjcenter()\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n\tcompile \"com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:$jacksonVersion\"\r\n\tcompile \"com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-parameter-names:$jacksonVersion\"\r\n\r\n\ttestCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'\r\n\ttestCompile 'org.assertj:assertj-core:3.8.0'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class AnySetterRegressionTests {\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tpublic void deserialization() throws Exception {\r\n\t\tString content = \"{ \\\"info1\\\":\\\"value1\\\", \\\"info2\\\":\\\"value2\\\" }\";\r\n\t\tObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\t\tobjectMapper.registerModule(new ParameterNamesModule());\r\n\t\tBaseClientDetails clientDetails = objectMapper.readValue(content, BaseClientDetails.class);\r\n\t\tMap<String, Object> additionalInfo = clientDetails.additionalInformation;\r\n\t\tassertThat(additionalInfo).hasSize(2);\r\n\t\tassertThat(additionalInfo.get(\"info1\")).isEqualTo(\"value1\");\r\n\t\tassertThat(additionalInfo.get(\"info2\")).isEqualTo(\"value2\");\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT)\r\n\t@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)\r\n\tstatic class BaseClientDetails {\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate final Map<String, Object> additionalInformation = new HashMap<>();\r\n\r\n\t\t@JsonAnySetter\r\n\t\tpublic void

is not registered, or when Jackson release `2.8.9` is used.\r\n\r\nThis was originally reported as
