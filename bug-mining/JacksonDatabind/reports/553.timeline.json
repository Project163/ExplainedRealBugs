I'm having some trouble with the GraphQL client (version 3.6.1). I'm getting an exception when `GraphQLClient` is trying to deserialize the response data to `GraphQLResponse<HubCheckOut.Result>`. The model itself looks fine and matches the JSON, but for some reason Jackson is not able to map it.\r\n\r\nIf I use a debugger to manually serialize to `Map<String, Any>` with the mapper it works, so the JSON is fine. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThis is the generated model class:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nconst val HUB_CHECK_OUT: String =\r\n    \"mutation HubCheckOut(${'$'}hubID: ID!, ${'$'}employeeID: ID!) {\\n    insertHubCheckedOutLogRecord(input: {hubId: ${'$'}hubID, employeeId: ${'$'}employeeID}) {\\n        record {\\n            shiftId\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\"\r\n\r\nclass HubCheckOut(\r\n  private val graphQLClient: GraphQLClient<*>\r\n) {\r\n  suspend fun execute(variables: HubCheckOut.Variables, requestBuilder: HttpRequestBuilder.() ->\r\n      Unit = {}): GraphQLResponse<HubCheckOut.Result> = graphQLClient.execute(HUB_CHECK_OUT,\r\n      \"HubCheckOut\", variables, requestBuilder)\r\n\r\n  data class Variables(\r\n    val hubID: ID,\r\n    val employeeID: ID\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  data class ShiftStateHubLogRecord(\r\n    val shiftId: ID?\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  data class InsertHubLogCheckedOutRecordResponse(\r\n    val record: HubCheckOut.ShiftStateHubLogRecord\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  data class Result(\r\n    val insertHubCheckedOutLogRecord: HubCheckOut.InsertHubLogCheckedOutRecordResponse?\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the exception:\r\n```\r\nStrange Map type java.util.Map: cannot

for the repros @dariuszkuc and @MartinTeeVarga . It seems that the issue with Kotlin and the example that @MartinTeeVarga provided are somewhat different than what I have. In my case, the issue is in serialization. I assume that the problems are related.\r\n@cowtowncoder  I now had some time to isolate the issue from the repository that I originally provided.  This is the simplest case I was able to strip it down to. I made some observations that if I change on of the 3 things:  \"Entity<?> -> Entity\", \"remove public static Attributes dummyMethod(Map attributes)\" or \"remove @JsonUnwrapped\", the test will pass and JSON serialization won't fail. It seems that the JsonUnwrapped together with generics and the static \"dummyMethod\" (in the repro) trigger the issue that I have faced.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class JacksonBugIsolatedTest {\r\n
