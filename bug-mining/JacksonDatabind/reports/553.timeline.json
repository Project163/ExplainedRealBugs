from databinding as requested)\n\nI don't know if this applies also for deserializing a json message, but by using the `XmlMapper` the resulting Map does only contain the last child node in case there are some `maxOccurence=\"unbounded\" elements.\n\nThe reason seems to be that the `Vanilla` implementation just uses `result.put(key,value)` instead of checking if there already exists an entry. \n\nI was able to get the expected result by modifying the method `mapObject(JsonParser jp, DeserializationContext ctxt)` and replacing all 'result.put' with an `addValue` delegate which looks like this:\n\n```\nprivate void addValue(Map<String, Object> result, String fieldName, Object value) {\n            if (!result.containsKey(fieldName)) {\n                result.put(fieldName, value);\n            } else {\n                Object existing = result.get(fieldName);\n                if (existing instanceof List) {\n                    ((List) existing).add(value);\n                } else {\n                    List list = new ArrayList();\n                    list.add(existing);\n                    list.add(value);\n                    result.put(fieldName, list);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nI could provide a pull request if this is considered a bug/improvement and is desired, but for that i would need to know where to hook in, as the current solution is based on the databinding

{\n    \"count\" : \"3\",\n    \"dog\" : {\n      \"name\" : \"Bob\",\n      \"age\" : \"14\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n#### Problem\n\nDuplicated elements in the entity get swallowed by current UntypedObjectDeserializer implementation.\n\nI can't use Typed Objects. In my use case, I don't have any typed objects, because I don't know how objects are sent to me.\n#### Possible Solution\n\nWhile creating the Map for the data, check if there are duplicated keys, and start an Array, with this approach, the output would be:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\" : \"John\",\n  \"parent\" : [ \"Jose\", \"Maria\" ],\n  \"dogs\" : {\n    \"count\" : \"3\",\n    \"dog\" : [ {\n      \"name\" : \"Spike\",\n      \"age\" : \"12\"\n    }, {\n      \"name\" : \"Brutus\",\n      \"age\" : \"9\"\n    }, {\n      \"name\" : \"Bob\",\n      \"age\" : \"14\"\n    } ]\n  }\n}\n```\n#### How to Reproduce\n\nGist\n- https://gist.github.com/joaovarandas/1543e792ed6204f0cf5fe860cb7d58ed\n\nArtifacts:\n- jackson-core\n- jackson-databind\n- jackson-dataformat-xml\n\nVersion:\n- 2.7.4\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe gist implements the solution using an extended version of the UntypedObjectDeserializer.\n\nIf not the default behavior, what about creating a new DeserializationFeature to enable this(default or not)?\n\nShould you guys like/aprove this solution, I can always fork the project and submit a pull request with the full solution as a feature or default behavior.\n\nThanks!\nJp\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/205/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/631871291","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2732#issuecomment-631871291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2732","id":631871291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTg3MTI5MQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-21T04:26:10Z","updated_at":"2020-05-21T04:26:10Z","body":"Actually,
