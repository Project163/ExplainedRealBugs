Figure out a replacement that is close enough to original one (if not exactly same), or\r\n2. Un-deprecate it\r\n\r\nIn former case we could do something as simple as \"move\" it to be `MapperFeature`, so that it can not be (attempted to be) changed on `ObjectWriter`, since even thought it can nominally be changed, change will not take effect as is.\r\nIn latter case we could just let it be used as is, with caveat that its semantics (wrt changing) differ from other `SerializationFeature`s.\r\n\r\nOn replacement: one initial thought was to add a new `JsonFormat.Feature` option; which would work nicely if there was a way to set global default (similar to `ObjectMapper.setDefaultPropertyInclusion()`), but currently there isn't (there is only per-class facility to set `JsonFormat.Value`). It would be possible to add such default, but since its only function would be to be used for this one format feature it may not be a way to go since it could be confusing in other ways (since other `JsonFormat.Value` choices would not be used).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1547/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
