yes, I can reproduce this.\r\n\r\nBefore looking at the fix, this does cause a problem since the way this should work (as per design) is as per (3): Jackson does (or at least attempts :) to) distinguish between primitive and wrapper types; and so current behavior is incorrect. Problem here is that changing this now is API changing as the problem was not caught before 2.12.0 release.\r\nAs a result, I don't think I can change this in 2.12.x, as patches should not cause behavior change (although obv there is grey area wrt bug fixes).\r\nI think I will do this for 2.13.0, however, since behavior is unintended and other configuration settings (for numbers, f.ex) do take into account primitive/wrapper distinction.\r\n\r\nIn theory I could try to specify defaulting of some sort (so that setting for `Boolean` would be default for `boolean`, but could further be overridden for `boolean`), but while that could be more compatible it would be different from handling of all types -- there should ideally be a general logic to primitive<-wrapper defaulting for all options. This does not exist, nor do I want to write one.\r\n\r\nSo.
