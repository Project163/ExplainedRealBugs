Full lexicographic (~= alphabetic) sorting of all properties\r\n2. Creator properties first (in declaration order), other properties in lexicographic order\r\n3. Creator properties first (in declaration order), other properties in whatever order we happen to get them\r\n4.

Search before asking\r\n\r\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI am encountering a problem where the field order is not preserved after serializing and deserializing objects in Jackson.\r\n\r\nI need access to only one specific field (transactionId), while I want to pass the remaining fields as they are, preserving the order in which they appear. I expected the transactionId field order might change, but I did not expect the order of the other fields `(a, b, c)` to change, especially in the second and third tests (SecondObject and ThirdObject). The data inside the `c` array is preserved in the expected order, but the surrounding fields are re-ordered.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n2.17.2\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n## Tested Objects:\r\n```kotlin\r\n@JsonAutoDetect(\r\n    fieldVisibility = JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.ANY,\r\n    getterVisibility = JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.NONE\r\n)\r\nclass FirstObject {\r\n    @field:JsonAnySetter\r\n    @field:JsonAnyGetter\r\n    val data: Map<String, Any?> = LinkedHashMap()\r\n\r\n    val transactionId: String\r\n        get() = data[\"transactionId\"] as String\r\n}\r\n\r\n@JsonAutoDetect(\r\n    fieldVisibility = JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.ANY,\r\n    getterVisibility = JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.NONE\r\n)\r\nclass SecondObject(\r\n    val transactionId: String\r\n) {\r\n    @field:JsonAnySetter\r\n    @field:JsonAnyGetter\r\n    val data: Map<String, Any?> = LinkedHashMap()\r\n}\r\n\r\n@JsonAutoDetect(\r\n    fieldVisibility = JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.ANY,\r\n    getterVisibility = JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.NONE\r\n)\r\nclass ThirdObject(\r\n    val transactionId: String,\r\n    @field:JsonAnySetter\r\n    @field:JsonAnyGetter\r\n    val data: Map<String, Any?> = LinkedHashMap()\r\n)\r\n``` \r\n## Input JSON for tests:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"b\": 2,\r\n  \"a\": 1,\r\n  \"transactionId\": \"test\",\r\n  \"c\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"3\",\r\n      \"value\": \"c\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"1\",\r\n      \"value\": \"a\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"2\",\r\n      \"value\": \"b\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Test Case:\r\nHere’s a test case to reproduce the issue. The following Kotlin test serializes and deserializes three different classes (FirstObject, SecondObject, and ThirdObject), comparing the serialized JSON with the original input JSON.\r\n[JacksonSortingTest.kt](https://github.com/arvgord/jackson-databind-sorting-issue/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/JacksonSortingTest.kt).\r\n### First Test Result (Passes):\r\nThe first test for FirstObject passes as expected, with the field order being preserved.\r\n### Failing Test Results:\r\nExpected:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"b\": 2,\r\n  \"a\": 1,\r\n  \"transactionId\": \"test\",\r\n  \"c\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"3\",\r\n      \"value\": \"c\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"1\",\r\n      \"value\": \"a\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"2\",\r\n      \"value\": \"b\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor SecondObject was:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"transactionId\": \"test\",\r\n  \"a\": 1,\r\n  \"b\": 2,\r\n  \"c\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"3\",\r\n      \"value\": \"c\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"1\",\r\n      \"value\": \"a\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"2\",\r\n      \"value\": \"b\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor ThirdObject was:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"transactionId\": \"test\",\r\n  \"c\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"3\",\r\n      \"value\": \"c\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"1\",\r\n      \"value\": \"a\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"2\",\r\n      \"value\": \"b\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"a\": 1,\r\n  \"b\": 2\r\n}\r\n```\r\nRepository for Reproduction:\r\nYou can find a repository with the full reproduction of the issue at [jackson-databind-sorting-issue](https://github.com/arvgord/jackson-databind-sorting-issue).\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFor SecondObject and ThirdObject, after serializing the object back to JSON, I expect the `transactionId` field to appear at the top, followed by the fields `b`, `a`, and `c`, in the exact order they were present when the JSON was deserialized into SecondObject and ThirdObject.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No
