integration tests written in Junit5 brining up a GenericContainer for end-to-end tests between components. When the tests are run in a host process the GenericContainer object is created successfully, but when tests are run within a container (like in Jenkins) the GenericContainer fails to build, throwing the exception reported in the log pane.\n\nDebugging the code, it seems the GenericContainer fails to deserialize dates in com.github.dockerjava.api.model.Network object when inspecting the docker network. The date format returned with docker network inspect is indeed \"2024-11-13T21:04:48.309416219+0100\", but apparently the BaseSettings initialized in ObjectMapper uses a StdDateFormat that is not able to parse it.\n\nReverting the dependency to testcontainers 1.17.6 made it work. I think this could be a regression.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\njava.lang.RuntimeException: org.testcontainers.shaded.com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException: Can not deserialize value of type java.util.Date from String \"2024-11-13T21:04:48.309416219+01:00\": not a valid representation (error: Failed to parse Date value '2024-11-13T21:04:48.309416219+01:00': Can not parse date \"2024-11-13T21:04:48.309416219+0100\": while it seems to fit format 'yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ', parsing fails (leniency? null))\n\n at [Source: N/A; line: -1, column: -1] (through reference chain: com.github.dockerjava.api.model.Network[\"Created\"])\n\tat org.testcontainers.shaded.com.github.dockerjava.core.DefaultInvocationBuilder.get(DefaultInvocationBuilder.java:77) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.shaded.com.github.dockerjava.core.exec.InspectNetworkCmdExec.execute(InspectNetworkCmdExec.java:26) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.shaded.com.github.dockerjava.core.exec.InspectNetworkCmdExec.execute(InspectNetworkCmdExec.java:12) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.shaded.com.github.dockerjava.core.exec.AbstrSyncDockerCmdExec.exec(AbstrSyncDockerCmdExec.java:21) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.shaded.com.github.dockerjava.core.command.AbstrDockerCmd.exec(AbstrDockerCmd.java:33) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.shaded.com.github.dockerjava.core.command.InpectNetworkCmdImpl.exec(InpectNetworkCmdImpl.java:7) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.dockerclient.DockerClientProviderStrategy.resolveDockerHostIpAddress(DockerClientProviderStrategy.java:453) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.dockerclient.DockerClientProviderStrategy.getDockerHostIpAddress(DockerClientProviderStrategy.java:424) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.DockerClientFactory.dockerHostIpAddress(DockerClientFactory.java:344) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.ContainerState.getHost(ContainerState.java:64) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.wait.strategy.HostPortWaitStrategy.waitUntilReady(HostPortWaitStrategy.java:112) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.wait.strategy.AbstractWaitStrategy.waitUntilReady(AbstractWaitStrategy.java:52) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer.waitUntilContainerStarted(GenericContainer.java:901) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer.tryStart(GenericContainer.java:492) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer.lambda$doStart$0(GenericContainer.java:346) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.rnorth.ducttape.unreliables.Unreliables.retryUntilSuccess(Unreliables.java:81) ~[duct-tape-1.0.8.jar:?]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer.doStart(GenericContainer.java:336) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer.start(GenericContainer.java:322) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.PortForwardingContainer.createSSHSession(PortForwardingContainer.java:43) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.PortForwardingContainer.getSshConnection(PortForwardingContainer.java:38) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.PortForwardingContainer.exposeHostPort(PortForwardingContainer.java:69) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.containers.PortForwardingContainer.exposeHostPort(PortForwardingContainer.java:63) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n\tat org.testcontainers.Testcontainers.exposeHostPorts(Testcontainers.java:14) ~[testcontainers-1.20.3.jar:1.20.3]\n```\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/9542/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/9542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
