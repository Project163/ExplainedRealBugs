ObjectMapper\r\nCarProperties -> {\"Speed\":100}\r\nCar           -> {\"model\":\"F60\",\"properties\":{\"Speed\":100}}\r\n\r\nTest2: Include.NON_NULL on ObjectMapper and Include.USE_DEFAULTS override on Map class \r\nCarProperties -> {\"Speed\":100,\"Weight\":null}\r\nCar           -> {\"model\":\"F60\",\"properties\":{\"Speed\":100}}\r\n\r\nTest3: Include.NON_NULL on ObjectMapper and Include.ALWAYS override on Map class \r\nCarProperties -> {\"Speed\":100,\"Weight\":null}\r\nCar           -> {\"model\":\"F60\",\"properties\":{\"Speed\":100}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n\r\n- In `Test2`, `Weight` property is included when properties map is serialized directly. Config override for `Map` class is set to `USE_DEFAULTS` which ultimately should resolve to `NON_NULL` as set on the mapper object, so weight should not be included and the output should be the same as `Test1`.\r\n\r\n- In `Test3`, `Weight` property is missing when `Car` is serialized. `Include` for `Map` class has been overridden with `ALWAYS` yet `Weight` property with null value is ignored when serializing the class. However, it is included when the map is serialized directly.
