This may work for some cases, but won't for others, because necessary parts of structure are missing.\r\n\r\nConceptually the idea would be that `null` for Type Id means \"do not add Type Id\", but doing so cannot be done by simply skipping calls to `JsonGenerator`s `writeTypePrefix()` and `writeTypeSuffix()`: rather, calls need to be made but these methods need to be aware of possibly missing type id and output whatever else is necessary.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: another way to describe this is that if `idFromValue()` / `idFromValueAndType()` returns `null`, serialization occurs AS IF non-polymorphic serialization was used. For `As.PROPERTY` / `As.EXISTING_PROPERTY`, for example, output would be similar but without `\"type\": \"typeId\"` entry in JSON Object; and for wrappers (`As.ARRAY_WRAPPER` / `As.OBJECT_WRAPPER`) no wrapping is added.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4407/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
