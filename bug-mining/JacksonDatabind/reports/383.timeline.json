But perhaps combination of considering:\n1. Non-existing of `defaultImpl` (I think?)\n2. Parsing being at root level (or close enough? With \"As-property\", should be root JSON Object)\n3. Current value being of proper, concrete type\n\ncould allow resolving intended type.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/206700401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":617841022,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NjE3ODQxMDIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/617841022","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-07T05:13:42Z","rename":{"from":"Deserialization: Use given concrete class if type property is missing (instead of `defaultImpl`)","to":"(2.8) Deserialization: Use given concrete class if type property is missing (instead of `defaultImpl`)"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/208823965","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/955#issuecomment-208823965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/955","id":208823965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODgyMzk2NQ==","user":{"login":"Martin-Luft","id":8995517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTU1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8995517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft","html_url":"https://github.com/Martin-Luft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Luft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-12T09:51:37Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T09:51:37Z","body":"Can the `objectMapper.readValue()` method check if **defaultImpl** is not set and in this case set **defaultImpl** with the provided class?

have a protocol where all JSON objects contain a `_type` field that indicates what the JSON represents. In some cases, protocol objects contain other protocol objects as properties. We are currently using Jackson 2.8.7 for serialization and deserialization.\r\n\r\nIf we define a `defaultImpl` class as a catch-all for unknown types, deserialization fails for any protocol objects that contain other protocol objects if the reference to those objects is `null`. It appears that Jackson attempts to substitute the `null` with an instance of the default class. This results in a `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException` exception as the default class is not a subclass of the property's type.\r\n\r\nThe following code illustrates the problem:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.test;\r\n\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonAnyGetter;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonAnySetter;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonGetter;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonSetter;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonSubTypes;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonSubTypes.Type;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.LinkedHashMap;\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\n\r\npublic class JacksonTest {\r\n\r\n    @JsonTypeInfo(\r\n        use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME,\r\n        include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY,\r\n        property = \"_type\",\r\n        visible = true,\r\n        defaultImpl = Default.class)\r\n        //visible = true)\r\n    @JsonSubTypes({\r\n        @Type(value = Inner.class, name = Inner._TYPE),\r\n        @Type(value = Outer.class, name = Outer._TYPE)\r\n    })\r\n    public static class Base {\r\n        private String type;\r\n\r\n        @JsonGetter(\"_type\")\r\n        public String type() {\r\n            return this.type;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @JsonSetter(\"_type\")\r\n        public void setType(String type) {\r\n            this.type = type;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected Base(String type) {\r\n            this.type = type;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class Inner extends Base {\r\n        public static final String _TYPE = \"inner\";\r\n\r\n        public Inner() {\r\n            super(_TYPE);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class Outer extends Base {\r\n        public static final String _TYPE = \"outer\";\r\n\r\n        private Inner inner;\r\n\r\n        public Outer() {\r\n            super(_TYPE);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @JsonGetter(\"inner\")\r\n        public Inner inner() {\r\n            return this.inner;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @JsonSetter(\"inner\")\r\n        public void setInner(Inner inner) {\r\n            this.inner = inner;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class Default extends Base {\r\n        private Map<String, Object> properties = new LinkedHashMap<String, Object>();\r\n\r\n        public Default() {\r\n            super(\"default\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @JsonAnySetter\r\n        public void set(String name, Object value) {\r\n            this.properties.put(name, value);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @JsonAnyGetter\r\n        public Map<String, Object> properties() {\r\n            return this.properties;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\r\n        // leave 'inner' as null\r\n        Outer originalOuter = new Outer();\r\n        try {\r\n            JsonNode tree = mapper.valueToTree(originalOuter);\r\n            Base base = mapper.treeToValue(tree, Base.class);\r\n            System.out.println(base.type());\r\n        } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this code produces the exception\r\n\r\n    com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Class com.example.test.JacksonTest$Default not subtype of [simple type, class com.example.test.JacksonTest$Inner]\r\n     at [Source: N/A;
