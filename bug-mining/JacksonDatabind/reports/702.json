Search before asking\n\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWe're using `@JsonSetter(nulls = Nulls.SKIP)` quite heavily in our code base to avoid dealing with `null` values, but yesterday I noticed that some fields contain `null` despite being annotated with `@JsonSetter(nulls = Nulls.SKIP)`\n\n### Version Information\n\n2.15.3, 2.15.4, 2.16.0, 2.16.1, 2.16.2, 2.17.0\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```java\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    static class Outer {\r\n        @JsonSetter(nulls = Nulls.SKIP)\r\n        private final List<Middle> list1 = new ArrayList<>();\r\n\r\n        public Outer() {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public List<Middle> getList1() {\r\n            return list1;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static class Middle {\r\n        @JsonSetter(nulls = Nulls.SKIP)\r\n        private final List<Inner> list1 = new ArrayList<>();\r\n        private final String field1;\r\n\r\n        @ConstructorProperties({\"field1\"})\r\n        public Middle(String field1) {\r\n            this.field1 = field1;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public List<Inner> getList1() {\r\n            return list1;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public String getField1() {\r\n            return field1;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static class Inner {\r\n        private final String field1;\r\n\r\n        @ConstructorProperties({\"field1\"})\r\n        public Inner(String field1) {\r\n            this.field1 = field1;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public String getField1() {\r\n            return field1;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        String json = \"\"\"\r\n                {\r\n                    \"list1\": [\r\n                        {\r\n                            \"list1\": null,\r\n                            \"field1\": \"data\"\r\n                        }\r\n                    ]\r\n                }\r\n                \"\"\";\r\n        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n        Outer outer;\r\n        try {\r\n            outer = objectMapper.readValue(json, Outer.class);\r\n        } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n        }\r\n        validateNotNull(outer);\r\n        validateNotNull(outer.getList1());\r\n        for (Middle middle : outer.getList1()) {\r\n            validateNotNull(middle);\r\n            validateNotNull(middle.getField1());\r\n            validateNotNull(middle.getList1());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static void validateNotNull(Object o) {\r\n        if (o == null) {\r\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Shouldn't be null\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n``` \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`middle.getList1()` shouldn't be `null` since it's annotated with `@JsonSetter(nulls = Nulls.SKIP)`\n\n### Additional context\n\nAny of the following seems to fix the issue, but is not really feasible to do:\r\n* Change the order of fields in the JSON:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"list1\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"field1\": \"data\",\r\n            \"list1\": null\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Remove `final` from `Middle#field1` and remove this field from constructor parameters","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
