Merging to `master` (3.0) found out that all these problems had been fixed for `3.0` (so `ArrayNode` now has `replace()`/`set()` similar to `ObjectNode`).\r\n\r\nThank you for suggestions here, and I hope these are useful: co-variant helps in some cases but not in all\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/498070197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/498135661","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2339#issuecomment-498135661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2339","id":498135661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODEzNTY2MQ==","user":{"login":"victornoel","id":160975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel","html_url":"https://github.com/victornoel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victornoel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-03T06:56:31Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T06:56:31Z","body":"yep,

I encountered some problems after I upgraded jackson-databind from 2.9.9.3 to 2.10: some of my calls to `ObjectNode.set` now cause compilation errors. I've reduced it to this minimal example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage org.example;\r\n\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.JsonNodeFactory;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode;\r\nimport java.util.function.Function;\r\n\r\npublic class JacksonCompilationFailure {\r\n\r\n    static ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n    static JsonNodeFactory jsonFactory = JsonNodeFactory.instance;\r\n\r\n    static ObjectNode editValue(ObjectNode value, String name, JsonNode v) throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n        return ((ObjectNode) objectMapper.readTree(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(value)))\r\n            .set(name, v);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static <T extends JsonNode> ObjectNode editValue(ObjectNode value, String name, Function<JsonNode, T> updater) throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n        ObjectNode cpy = (ObjectNode) objectMapper.readTree(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(value));\r\n        return cpy.set(name, updater.apply(cpy.get(name)));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n        ObjectNode a = (ObjectNode) objectMapper.readTree(\"{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\"}\");\r\n        ObjectNode b = editValue(a, \"foo\", jsonFactory.objectNode().set(\"bar\", jsonFactory.textNode(\"boo\")));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fails with the compilation error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError:(27, 24) java: reference to editValue is ambiguous\r\n  both method editValue(com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode,java.lang.String,com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode) in org.example.JacksonCompilationFailure and method <T>editValue(com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode,java.lang.String,java.util.function.Function<com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode,T>) in org.example.JacksonCompilationFailure match\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs best as I can tell, this is because the [`set` method returns `<T extends\r\nJsonNode>\r\nT`](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.10/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/node/ObjectNode.java#L385)\r\nwhere `T` is not constrained by the arguments, so the compiler can't infer the\r\ntype `T` in the above case. If you explicitly specify the type parameter in the\r\ncall to `set`, or bind it to a variable before passing it as an argument, it\r\ncompiles and runs fine:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        ObjectNode b = editValue(a, \"foo\", jsonFactory.objectNode().<ObjectNode>set(\"bar\", jsonFactory.textNode(\"boo\")));\r\n        // or alternatively:\r\n        ObjectNode o = jsonFactory.objectNode().set(\"bar\", jsonFactory.textNode(\"boo\"));\r\n        ObjectNode b = editValue(a, \"foo\", o);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ObjectNode.setAll` has the same issue, and possibly some other methods as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is considered fixed, because the return type on master is `ObjectNode` which should not cause these issues, but [the 2.11 branch also has the same `<T extends JsonNode> T` return type](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.11/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/node/ObjectNode.java#L385) as 2.10 does.\r\n\r\nThe original context in which I encountered this is [here, in Scala](https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/blob/master/webauthn-server-core/src/test/scala/com/yubico/webauthn/RelyingPartyRegistrationSpec.scala#L1025), which also fails to disambiguate which overload of `editAttestationObject` to call. This causes a few more issues with type inference in Scala, but I'm not sure Scala support is a major concern for the project.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
