there! I'm using jackson-module-kotlin and I like my null safety, but Jackson doesn't appear to respect these desires. I've been fighting with this issue for nearly 4 hours, and the guidance I've found is very confusing. I'm creating the issue here because I believe the solution lies with `jackson-databind` and not `jackson-module-kotlin`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata class ObjectWithStringList(val strings: List<String>)\r\n\r\n@Test\r\nfun `list contains null`() {\r\n    expectThrows<JsonProcessingException> {\r\n        val result = ObjectMapper().registerKotlinModule().readValue<ObjectWithStringList>(\"\"\"{ \"strings\": [\"a\", null, \"b\"] }\"\"\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nObjectWithStringList defines strings as List<String>, which means that users should expect that the strings inside the list are never null (List<String?> would mean it could contain nulls). When I run this test, however, it fails (the exception is not thrown). What happens instead is result[1] evaluates to null, which should never happen according to Kotlin.\r\n\r\nWhat do I want? Ideally I would want jackson-module-kotlin to respect collection element types' nullity, however I realize this is idealistic and may be difficult. Instead, I would like the default behavior of deserializing any list type with nulls (whether String or String?) to throw an exception. And then I would like some way to override this behavior if I really want to allow nulls in my list.\r\n\r\nI've gone down the rabbit hole and tried a large number of things (which I can summarize upon request, but for brevity's sake, decided not to here), and have been unable to find anything acceptable. The best solution I've found so far is implementing my own collection type (see below) but the drawback to this solution is that I still want it to appear as List, not ArrayListOfNotNull.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata class ObjectWithStringList(val strings: ArrayListOfNotNull<String>)\r\nclass ArrayListOfNotNull<E: Any> : ArrayList<E> {\r\n    constructor(): super()\r\n    constructor(initialSize: Int): super(initialSize)\r\n    constructor(elements: Collection<E>): super(elements) { require(elements.none { it == null }) }\r\n    override fun addAll(elements: Collection<E>): Boolean { require(elements.none { it == null }); return super.addAll(elements) }\r\n    override fun addAll(index: Int, elements: Collection<E>): Boolean { require(elements.none { it == null }); return super.addAll(index, elements) }\r\n    override fun add(element: E): Boolean { requireNotNull(element); return super.add(element) }\r\n    override fun add(index: Int, element: E) { requireNotNull(element); super.add(index, element) }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso note that this did not work (I was really hoping it would):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata class ObjectWithStringList(@JsonDeserializer(`as` = ArrayListOfNotNull::class) val strings: List<String>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven if it did work, however, it's not the default behavior (which was my original preference).\r\n\r\nWith the plethora of ways to integrate into Jackson Databind, what is the recommended approach here? Additionally, I have to believe this affects lots of Kotlin users, whether they realize it or not (and I think the latter is more likely). As a result, I'd like to see some documentation added for handling this type of situation, because I could not find much of substance.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"robvarga","id":2808019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDgwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2808019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga","html_url":"https://github.com/robvarga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robvarga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T22:53:27Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T22:53:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3214","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3214/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3214/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3214/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3214","id":945804479,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NDU4MDQ0Nzk=","number":3214,"title":"For

the bug**\r\nWhen using @ConstructorProperties-annotated constructor to deserialize type, for an attribute of type JsonNode which is absent from the deserialized JSON, a NullJsonNode is passed to the constructor instead of null reference.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if there is a workaround (e.g. some annotation indicating what to do for absent properties, or configuring some alternative deserializer on a per-property basis which is able to deal with this) for this issue which works with a constructor and final attributes instead of having to resort to non-final attributes and setters. \r\nSince our project is on 2.7.5 at the moment, I would particularly be intereted if there is a workaround for 2.7.x which allows me to inject null instead of this NullNode at least on a per object basis if not on a per-property basis.\r\n\r\nIf there is no workaround, then this should probably be fixed or a workaround should be provided which works with final attributes and @ConstructorProperties-annotated constructor.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nWhich Jackson version(s) was this for?\r\nReproduced with 2.12.4, 2.9.8 and 2.7.5\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nIf you have a way to reproduce this with:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage jacksontests;\r\nimport java.beans.ConstructorProperties;\r\nimport org.junit.Assert;\r\nimport org.junit.Test;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n\r\npublic class JsonNodeNullTest {\r\n\r\n    public static class TestClass {\r\n\r\n        private final JsonNode nodeFromConstructor;\r\n        private JsonNode nodeFromSetter;\r\n\r\n        @ConstructorProperties(\"nodeFromConstructor\")\r\n        public TestClass(JsonNode nodeFromConstructor) {\r\n            this.nodeFromConstructor = nodeFromConstructor;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public JsonNode getNodeFromSetter() {\r\n            return nodeFromSetter;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setNodeFromSetter(JsonNode nodeFromSetter) {\r\n            this.nodeFromSetter = nodeFromSetter;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public JsonNode getNodeFromConstructor() {\r\n            return nodeFromConstructor;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testJsonNodeNulls() throws Exception {\r\n        TestClass res = new ObjectMapper().readValue(\"{}\", TestClass.class);\r\n        Assert.assertNotNull(res);\r\n        Assert.assertNull(res.getNodeFromSetter());\r\n        Assert.assertNull(res.getNodeFromConstructor());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe unit test fails as res.getNodeFromConstructor() returns a NullNode instead of null.\r\nIt should return null identically to the property which is setter-populated. (The setter does not get called).\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
