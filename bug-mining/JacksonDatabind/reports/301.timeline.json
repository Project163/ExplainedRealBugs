have run into this problem when I upgrade to Spring Boot 2.0.0.M2 which use the 2.9 version of Jackson, here is my test case: \r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testAnyGetterSetter() {\r\n        Employee employee = new Employee();\r\n        employee.setName(\"Jack\");\r\n        employee.setAge(22);\r\n        employee.setOther(\"address\", \"ShangHai\");\r\n        String jsonString = JSON.toJsonString(employee);\r\n        assertThat(jsonString).isNotBlank().contains(\"\\\"address\\\" : \\\"ShangHai\\\"\");\r\n        assertThat(JSON.parseObject(jsonString, Employee.class))\r\n                .isNotNull()\r\n                .isEqualToComparingFieldByFieldRecursively(employee);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Data\r\n    public static class Employee {\r\n

difference: <other>\r\n- expected: <{\"address\"=\"ShangHai\"}>\r\n- actual  : <{}>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or something I did wrong
