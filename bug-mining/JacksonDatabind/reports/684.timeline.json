actually, it's not so much `EnumDeserializer` that is not playing nicely, but rather `EnumSetDeserializer`... since that would have to create and use `TypeDeserializer` for `Enum` values.\r\nThis is what basic `CollectionDeserializer` does.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I have time to work much more on this issue but if anyone wants to try to figure it out would be happy to review PR.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1827037376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1827064102","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4214#issuecomment-1827064102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4214","id":1827064102,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c5s5skm","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-27T03:19:35Z","updated_at":"2023-11-27T03:19:35Z","body":"Ok,
