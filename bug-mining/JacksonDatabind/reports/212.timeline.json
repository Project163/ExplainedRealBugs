This should be documented better, but 2.8 introduced a way to apply `@JsonFormat` and `@JsonInclude` defaults for specific types. In this case `@JsonInclude` is what you want (javadocs incorrectly refer to `@JsonFormat`).\n\nFrom `JsonIncludeTest`:\n\n```\n    mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n    mapper.configOverride(List.class)\n        .setInclude(JsonInclude.Value.construct(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY, null));\n```\n\nwhich should have similar effect for `List` valued properties, further overridable on per-property basis if necessary. For arrays type must be specified (`String[].class` and so on).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/240008166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":756573230,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzU2NTczMjMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/756573230","actor":{"login":"richturner","id":7072278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzIyNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7072278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner","html_url":"https://github.com/richturner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-16T05:52:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":756573232,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc1NjU3MzIzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/756573232","actor":{"login":"richturner","id":7072278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzIyNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7072278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner","html_url":"https://github.com/richturner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richturner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-16T05:52:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/240008382","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1327#issuecomment-240008382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1327","id":240008382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDAwODM4Mg==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/r
