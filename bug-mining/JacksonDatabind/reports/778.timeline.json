But if not, throw exception\n* `asIntOpt()` like `asInt()` but returns `OptionalInt`, either present (as per `asInt()`) or absent (instead of exception)\n\nbut as with `JsonNode.xxxValue()` methods like `intValue()`, no exception is thrown but quietly default value (like `0` for `int`) is returned. For Jackson 3.0 we have unchecked `JsonNodeException` so use that instead.\nWe can also clarify coercions that are allowed, as well as extend set of `asXxx()` methods as it makes sense.\n\nTypes/methods to handle:\n\n* `asDecimal()` (`BigDecimal`)\n* `asDouble()`\n* `asInt()`\n* `asLong()`\n\nbut let's also add\n\n* `asBigInteger()`\n\n(probably not `asFloat()` or `asShort()`

`asByte()`)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5003/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16610812799,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c6r3CJazwAAAAPeFON_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/16610812799","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"02ee69ef7cbc063de4c84995d29ab08eca66659c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/02ee69ef7cbc063de4c84995d29ab08eca66659c","created_at":"2025-03-06T04:30:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16626344286,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c6r3CJazwAAAAPfAeFe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/16626344286","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0a2c836f76838694a5aa569f592c3a56ff23080c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/0a2c836f76838694a5aa569f592c3a56ff23080c","created_at":"2025-03-07T04:04:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16704449531,"node_id":"CE_lADOAC5e2c6r3CJazwAAAAPjqav7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/16704449531","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-12T04:15:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16704451244,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAC5e2c6r3CJazwAAAAPjqbKs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/16704451244","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followin

Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn Spring Security, we have a green unit test that can be reduced to:\n```java\nJsonNode node = JsonMapper.builder().build().readTree(\"{\\\"username\\\":\\\"admin\\\",\\\"password\\\":null}\");\nassertThat(node.get(\"password\").textValue()).isNull();\n```\nLooks basic, when I read a null String, I get `null` as expected.\n\nWith Jackson 3, this use case seems broken with both `asString` and `stringValue`:\n - `node.get(\"password\").asString()` returns `\"\"` (empty string)\n - `node.get(\"password\").asString(null)` also returns `\"\"` (empty string)\n - `node.get(\"password\").stringValue()` fails with a `'NullNode' method `stringValue()` cannot convert value <null> to `java.lang.String`: value type not String`exception\n - `node.get(\"password\").stringValue(null)` return `null` but we can't use that as `\"{\\\"username\\\":\\\"admin\\\",\\\"password\\\":1}\"` would also return a `null` String.\n - `node.get(\"password\").asStringOpt()` returns an `Optional` of \"\" (`Optional` of empty string)\n\nI think the root issue here is not default value handling. The root issue here seems to be that on deserialization side, `null` is not considered as a valid value for JSON String, while in Jackson 2 it was and while in Jackson 3 serialization side it still is, as `writeValueAsString(new User(\"admin\", null))` write `{\"password\":null,\"username\":\"admin\"}` as expected.\n\nI would expect Jackson 3 to allow me to get nullable string values when expected without having to rely on default values that are applicable to a lot of other use case as explained above, so not usable here.\n\nThe behavior I would expect is that Jackson 3 deserialization consider `null` as a valid String value so with `\"{\\\"username\\\":\\\"admin\\\",\\\"password\\\":null}\"`:\n - `node.get(\"password\").asString()` would return `null` instead of `\"\"`\n - `node.get(\"password\").stringValue()` would return return `null` instead of `\"\"`\n  - `node.get(\"password\").asStringOpt()` would return an empty `Optional` instead of an `Optional` of \"\" (`Optional` of empty string)\n\n### Version Information\n\n3.0.0-rc8\n\n### Reproduction\n\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5283/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
