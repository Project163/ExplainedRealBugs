follow up on #2456 )\r\n\r\nCurrently most of caching Jackson does internally (for reusing things like serializers, deserializers, to avoid re-resolving some generic types and so on) is internally defined with settings that can not be changed. But it would make sense to expose an interface, like cache provider, that could be changed to override either some parameters (sizes for default caches) or even cache implementations if that matters. This would also allow things like instrumentation  (for cache hit rates) and using time-based eviction, dynamic sizing and so on.\r\n\r\nKnown caches are in:\r\n\r\n* `DeserializerCache` (added via #4101)\r\n* `SerializerCache` (added via #4111)\r\n* `TypeFactory` (added via #4115)\r\n* `RootNameLookup` (small -- probably no need to configure)\r\n* `JacksonAnnotationIntrospector` (`_annotationsInside`) -- (tiny, likely no need to configure either)\r\n\r\nSome modules may add their own caches as well although not many do; and so configuration of those can be separate from
