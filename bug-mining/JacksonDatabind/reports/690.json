This is done for following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Later JDK versions have stricter access checks, and reducing amount of discovery/access-forcing for JDK types reduces warnings (and sometimes actual failures), without reducing access to User-Provided Types (UPT)\r\n2. Forced access to Platform types may open up security holes in conjunction with Polymorphic Deserialization -- problematic as they are known to exist and hence much easier to exploit that User-Provided Types. So closing access may improve security as well\r\n3. JDK types to support mostly already have explicit (de)serializers, so auto-detection is rarely used for actual handling (and can be added for types as needed)\r\n\r\nDue to legacy reasons, there are also \"well-known\" Platform types under some other packages; most notably `sun.security` (and generally anything under `sun.*`). For example see #4204.\r\n\r\nSo, for Jackson 2.17, let's consider adding this set of classes as \"platform\" (JDK) types for more limited auto-discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
