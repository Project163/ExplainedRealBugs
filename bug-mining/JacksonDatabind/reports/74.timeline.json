using Jackson 2.2.2 in a Dropwizard service. I'm attempting to create a resource method with a bounded type parameter:\n\n```\n@POST\npublic <P extends Period> P createPeriod(@PathParam(VERSION_ID) String versionId,\n                               P period)\n```\n\nHowever, when I attempt to post JSON to this endpoint, `com.yammer.dropwizard.jersey.JacksonMessageBodyProvider` deserializes the request as a `LinkedHashMap` instead of a `Period`. I believe there is enough information provided in the method declaration that Jackson should be able to deserialize this correctly. I've traced the problem to the `TypeFactory#_fromVariable` method.\n\n`JacksonMessageBodyProvider` extends `com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs.base.ProviderBase` and calls `super.readFrom(Class<Object> type, Type genericType, Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType, MultivaluedMap<String,String> httpHeaders, InputStream entityStream)` with the following arguments:\n\n```\ntype: class Period\ngenericType: sun.reflect.generics.reflectiveObjects.TypeVariableImpl with name \"P\"\nannotations: []\nmediaType: application/json\nand the provided headers and stream\n```\n\nThis ends up calling the last line in `ProviderBase#readFrom`: \n\n```\nreturn reader.withType(genericType).readValue(jp);\n```\n\n`ObjectReader#withType` eventually calls `TypeFactory#constructType(Type type)`, which passes a `null` context to `_constructType(Type type, TypeBindings context)`. Since `type` is an instance of `TypeVariable`, it ends up calling `TypeFactory#_fromVariable(TypeVariable<?> type, TypeBindings context)`.\n\nSince `context` is `null`, this method immediately returns `_unknownType()`, which means the object ends up deserialized as a `LinkedHashMap`. However, if I call `getBounds()` on the `type` object while in the `_fromVariable` method, it returns an array containing `Period.class`. It seems that if we didn't short-circuit due to the null context, `_fromVariable` would eventually return the right type on the last line: `return _constructType(bounds[0], context);`\n\nI've searched and couldn't find this exact issue. I looked at the [latest code](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/540213faa9efc3904b27cf9ee61cc1f5700063a0/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/type/TypeFactory.java#L913) and see the same line, so I don't think upgrading would help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
