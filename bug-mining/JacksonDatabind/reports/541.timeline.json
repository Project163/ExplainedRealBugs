If so, the examples in the tests only have a single delegating creator each, one example from a primitive and the other from an array. Can you clarify?\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nWhat concerns me is the inconsistent impact of the creators based on type on the normal (non-`@JsonCreator` based) object deserialization. Specifically, that it's possible to have a primitive creator and still retain deserialization from objects, but it's not possible to have an array creator and retain deserialization from objects.\r\n\r\nWhile I like the idea of being able to specify an alternate creation path while still retaining the object deserialization semantics, the inconsistency was surprising. Should `@JsonCreator` based deserialization prevent deserialization via any other means? \r\n\r\nAt least documentation and a clearer error message would be advisable. \r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I dove into it, but as I mentioned above and in the review, on the surface it would seem possible to address this if the vanilla-ness of the deserialization were deferred until the shape of the input were determined. Specifically, the deserialization is vanilla unless the input shape matches the creator argument shape (object => map, array => array/list, primitive => primitive). Not sure what the consequences of deferring this decision are.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/623006766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vjkoskela","id":1775197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzUxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela","html_url":"https://github.com/vjkoskela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/623013276","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2486#issuecomment-623013276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2486","id":623013276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzAxMzI3Ng==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-02T21:06:59Z","updated_at":"2020-05-02T21:06:59Z","body":"side note: created #2707 and implemented it;

And it is not quite what I expected.\r\n\r\nBasically, there are couple of different classes of creators for POJOs, added in roughly this order over time\r\n\r\n1. \"Default\" (0-argument) -- used for traditional POJOs, where creation is separate from setting values (create + deserialize)\r\n2. Scalar creators: close-coupling with a small number of primitive/simple types, discoverable without annotation -- String, int, long, boolean (and matching wrappers). Essentially delegating but special case later generalized\r\n3. Properties-based Creator (constructor, static factory): construction and deserialization coupled (deserializer has to read and buffer values)\r\n4. Full delegation: originally just one method, but with contribution separate \"array delegation\" was added.\r\n\r\nOf these, 1 and 4 are mutually exclusive: you can not have both delegating and traditional default constructor with setters approach, only one.\r\nThis is the problem here as existence of \"array delegating\"  prevents use of expected traditional POJO creation.\r\nI think I was wrong earlier, and that it would be legal to have \"delegating\" AND \"array-delegating\".\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, I will see if it would actually be possible to support intended usage here. It seems possible that maybe combination might be supportable.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this gives me some ideas of how to maybe improve the handling for 3.x (if not earlier). Division in many cases is by \"shape\" of incoming type, and maybe one could annotate `@JsonCreator`s to support more interesting delegation -- so that one could match `JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT` to `BigInteger`, or any other type that can be deserialized from integral number.\r\nSimilarly for other shapes as well. This would reduce need for hard-coded mappings to small set of types.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/623043876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3296991624,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI5Njk5MTYyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/3296991624","actor":{"login":"vjkoskela","id":1775197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzUxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela","html_url":"https://github.com/vjkoskela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-03T02:24:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3296991626,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyOTY5OTE2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/3296991626","actor":{"login":"vjkoskela","id":1775197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzUxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela","html_url":"https://github.com/vjkoskela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-03T02:24:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/623047471","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2486#issuecomment-623047471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2486","id":623047471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzA0NzQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_even

If you come up with a path forward for 2.x please post here, I may have some cycles over the next few weeks to take a look. I'm back in Java land for a while and certainly if I run into this again it would give me a reason to invest some cycles.\r\n\r\nFor context, the specific use cases that brought this up were extending two existing serialization models from primitive (case 1) and array (case 2) to object. So we created an object to represent the new model in each case, and added `@JsonCreator` methods to support the old models (from primitive in one case and from array in another). That's when we noticed that only the primitive `@JsonCreator` path allowed us to also deserialize from the new object shape as well.\r\n\r\nI also updated the tests, looks like you did too - thank you - and they now include variants that do not deserialize through the Builder (just into it) and behave the same way.
