If it does not occur, you might want to wait for 2.7.0-rc1 which should be released quite soon (I am hoping for next weekend). If it still occurs, the way generics are resolved probably needs more work; you'd have to follow the build process and compare that to standard handling of Bean(De)Serializer. I suspect this is related to either using raw (type erased) type where generic type is needed; or generic type being resolved using wrong context. Latter becomes bit involved, but basically one has to get type from accessor and resolve it against exact class in which it was declared. With 2.7 this is properly automated so that calling 'getType()' of accessor (like `AnnotatedField` or `AnnotatedMethod`) should do it all; but with older versions, calls had to do more work-arounds.\n\nSo yeah, it can be bit involved. I hope to get this working for 2.7 regardless, but there is a significant backlog of issues to work on unfortunately.

the type is generic (e.g. `Foo<T>`) then its builder is also likely generic (e.g. `Foo$Builder<T>`). In such a case there is inevitably a setter on the builder that takes T (e.g. `public void setBar(final T value)`). When you deserialize json into such a type you do so with a type reference (e.g. `new TypeReference<Foo<Bar>>(){}`. Although the resulting pojo is constructed via its builder the provided type reference is for the resulting type and not its builder. \n\nThere is a bug in Jackson where the type binding information from the type reference is not carried over to the builder. Consequently, when deserializing content for `setBar` the type of the value is undetermined and is therefore deserialized by default as a `TreeMap`. The issue in Jackson is: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/921\n\nIn such situations the recommended work around is to deserialize into the builder and then manually call `build`. This is easy if the generic type is at the top level; however, if it's buried in the type hierarchy you would need to use a custom serializer to achieve this same result at the desired level.\n\nTests were added for a generic and non-generic round-trip with builders through Jackson in #16.

So this does not appear to be a regression -- not sure if that was clear, at least based on a-k-g's issue #1210.\n\nI've been debugging this in the 2.7 branch and in [BeanDeserializerFactory's createBuilderBasedDeserializer method](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.7/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/BeanDeserializerFactory.java#L147) the valueType contains the bindings as expected, they are not in beanDesc but looking at the [BasicBeanDescription](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.7/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/introspect/BasicBeanDescription.java#L57) that does not seem unexpected. However, the builderType created in this method does not discover/inherit the bindings from the valueType. As a crude first attempt I tried to build the builder type with the value type's bindings:\n\n``` java\nJavaType builderType = ctxt.getTypeFactory().constructType(builderClass, valueType.getBindings())\n```\n\nHowever, builderClass is not a ParameterizedType so TypeFactory refuses to perform this construction.  Temporarily working around this by exposing _fromClass on TypeFactory publicly yields:\n\n```\nJavaType builderType = ctxt.getTypeFactory()._fromClass(null, builderClass, valueType.getBindings());\n```\n\nAnd this fixes the problem! -- and all existing tests continue to pass -- So aside from coming up with a cleaner way in TypeFactory to allow this combined type creation (builder base class and value type bindings) there is the question of what assumptions this introduces between the type bindings of the value type and builder. \n\nConsider:\n\n1) Rename the `T` parameter to `U` in the builder _only_. This results in the same problem where the generic member's type cannot be determined correctly. Below is the pojo,  builder and test:\n\n``` java\n@JsonDeserialize(builder = MyGenericPOJO_B.Builder.class)\n    public static class MyGenericPOJO_B<T> {\n        private List<T> data;\n\n        private MyGenericPOJO_B(List<T> d) {\n            data = d;\n        }\n\n        public List<T> getData() {\n            return data;\n        }\n\n        public static class Builder<U> {\n            private List<U> data;\n\n            public Builder<U> withData(List<U> d) {\n                data = d;\n                return this;\n            }\n\n            public MyGenericPOJO_B<U> build() {\n                return new MyGenericPOJO_B<U>(data);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void testWithBuilder_B() throws Exception {\n        final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n        final String json = \"{ \\\"data\\\": [ { \\\"x\\\": \\\"x\\\", \\\"y\\\": \\\"y\\\" } ] }\";\n        final MyGenericPOJO_B<MyPOJO> deserialized =\n                mapper.readValue(json, new TypeReference<MyGenericPOJO_B<MyPOJO>>() {});\n        assertEquals(1, deserialized.data.size());\n        Object ob = deserialized.data.get(0);\n        assertNotNull(ob);\n        assertEquals(MyPOJO.class, ob.getClass());\n    }\n```\n\n2) Two parameters if the order of types are swapped across the value type and builder type. No surprise here either, this fails to deserialize correctly. Below is the pojo,  builder and test:\n\n``` java\n    public static class MyGenericPOJOWithCreator<T, U> {\n      private List<T> data;\n      private Map<String, U> map;\n\n      private MyGenericPOJOWithCreator(List<T> d, Map<String, U> m) {\n          data = d;\n          map = m;\n      }\n\n      @JsonCreator\n      public static <T, U> MyGenericPOJOWithCreator<T, U> create(\n              @JsonProperty(\"data\") List<T> data,\n              @JsonProperty(\"map\") Map<String, U> map) {\n          return new MyGenericPOJOWithCreator.Builder<T, U>().withData(data).withMap(map).build();\n      }\n\n      public List<T> getData() {\n          return data;\n      }\n\n      public Map<String, U> getMap() {\n          return map;\n      }\n\n      public static class Builder<U, T> {\n          private List<U> data;\n          private Map<String, T> map;\n\n          public Builder<U, T> withData(List<U> d) {\n              data = d;\n              return this;\n          }\n\n          public Builder<U, T> withMap(Map<String, T> m) {\n              map = m;\n              return this;\n          }\n\n          public MyGenericPOJOWithCreator<U, T> build() {\n              return new MyGenericPOJOWithCreator<U, T>(data, map);\n          }\n      }\n    }\n\n    public void testWithBuilder() throws Exception {\n      final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n      final String json = \"{ \\\"data\\\": [ { \\\"x\\\": \\\"x\\\", \\\"y\\\": \\\"y\\\" } ], \\\"map\\\": { \\\"a\\\": 1, \\\"b\\\": 2 } }\";\n      final MyGenericPOJO<MyPOJO, Integer> deserialized =\n          mapper.readValue(json, new TypeReference<MyGenericPOJO<MyPOJO, Integer>>() {});\n      assertEquals(1, deserialized.data.size());\n      Object ob = deserialized.data.get(0);\n      assertNotNull(ob);\n      assertEquals(MyPOJO.class, ob.getClass());\n    }\n```\n\nThe exception shows it tries to deserialize the integer value for the data object:\n\n```\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Can not deserialize instance of java.lang.Integer out of START_OBJECT token\n at [Source: { \"data\": [ { \"x\": \"x\", \"y\": \"y\" } ], \"map\": { \"a\": 1, \"b\": 2 } }; line: 1, column: 13] (through reference chain: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Builder[\"data\"]->java.util.ArrayList[0])\n```\n\nThe type reference for the value type does not imply anything about the builder's generic type bindings. One option that we could consider a BuilderTypeReference to pass such a binding into the deserialization. Another option would be to add annotations to the builder and/or value expressing how the bindings map from the value class to the builder class. However, such measures should only be necessary when the bindings don't map 1:1 in name and order across the value type and builder type. The common case for us at least is that the parameter mapping exists so simply supporting transfer of bindings does not seem like an unreasonable start.\n\nIf someone can give some guidance on my strategy and how TypeFactory should be extended to supporting merging a value type's bindings with the builder class into a builder type I can submit a PR for this. Otherwise, if I'm barking up the wrong tree here any pointers would be welcome!\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/243977279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vjkoskela","id":1775197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzUxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela","html_url":"https://github.com/vjkoskela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":774631804,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Nzc0NjMxODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/774631804","actor":{"login":"gilbode","id":2422580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjI1ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2422580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode","html_url":"https://github.com/gilbode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-01T05:07:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":774631805,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc3NDYzMTgwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/774631805","actor":{"login":"gilbode","id":2422580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjI1ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2422580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode","html_url":"https://github.com/gilbode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-01T05:07:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":774631806,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Nzc0NjMxODA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/774631806","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-01T05:07:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":774631807,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc3NDYzMTgwNw=="

{}\n}\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        String json = \"{\\\"value\\\": \\\"123\\\"}\";\n        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new

java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Long`. \n\nHowever changing deserialization from `@JsonDeserialize(builder = GenericType.Builder.class)` to static `@JsonCreator` seems to solve the problem, but ideally we don't want to write this manually.\n\nIt is worth noting that using `String json = \"{\\\"value\\\": 123}\";` result in `java.lang.Integer` being deserialized instead of `java.lang.Long`. So it looks like Jackson is picking up some default deserialization method (String for JSON String, Integer for JSON Number) instead of trying to deserialize into custom type. It is especially annoying if you try to use StringWrapper-like classes.\n\nTested with jackson 2.4.4 and 2.6.5.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/inferred/FreeBuilder/issues/190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/inferred/FreeBuilder/issues/190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/263545828","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/921#issuecomment-263545828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/921","id":263545828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzU0NTgyOA==","user":{"login":"olasundell","id":724772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/724772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell","html_url":"https://github.com/olasundell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olasundell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-29T11:25:13Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T11:25:13Z","body":"I've searched in vain for a +1 feature on GitHub issues but to no avail.

After re-reading everything above I think I finally understand the problem accurately. Many thanks to @vjkoskela for digging through it. That's good news.\r\n\r\nAs to bad news... to be completely honest I don't know if this will ever be supported. @vjkoskela is correct in pointing out that the issue is that builder type is specified as type-erased class and there is no way to really either indicate or infer type parameterization. It is not safe, in general, to assume that there is strict equivalency of bindings between value and builder type declarations: even if names are same (like `T`) seems dangerous. As per points (1) and (2) these wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nIn theory one could perhaps figure out type by first fully resolving value type, with generics; then locate build method from builder, and try to backtrack actual type parameterization by matching expected value type into type parameters exposed by build method. This is probably solvable but would require someone to really really dig deep into type handling (reification?). I don't think I'll have time or interest to pursue that myself.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, maybe naive matching of type bindings between value and builder could be acceptable, but only if:\r\n\r\n1. Number of names of type variables are identical. So, `<T>` would match `<T>`, but not `<U>` or `<T,V>`\r\n2. Bounds should be compatible (perhaps even strictly base bound)\r\n\r\nand if above do not match, a hard exception should be thrown to indicate invalid definitions.\r\nThis could achieve two goals:\r\n\r\n1. Work for simplest/trivial cases, and should allow translation of other cases to these (that is, avoiding use of same id etc)\r\n2. Catch many/most problems early, instead of failing in more mysterious ways (like when bound types do not match).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/263665409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":875736035,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODc1NzM2MDM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/875736035","actor":{"login":"vjkoskela","id":1775197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzUxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela","html_url":"https://github.com/vjkoskela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-29T19:03:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":875736036,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg3NTczNjAzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/875736036","actor":{"login":"vjkoskela","id":1775197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzUxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela","html_url":"https://github.com/vjkoskela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjkoskela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-29T19:03:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":875736220,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDg3NTczNjIyMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/875736220","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-29T19:03:30Z","label":{"name"
