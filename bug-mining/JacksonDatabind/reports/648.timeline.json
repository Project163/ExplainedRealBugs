I am not saying that case-sensitive ordering is optimal, just that it is how things currently work -- so it should at very least be documented.\r\nIt is also not something that was consciously chosen but rather what JDK `String` default ordering does. Implementing case-insensitive ordering requires more work, and then the challenge is simply that doing this is a behavioral change, and some use cases (or at very least tests) probably assume that the current way is the way it will always work... and changing to case-insensitive could break other use cases.\r\n\r\nSo: thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.
