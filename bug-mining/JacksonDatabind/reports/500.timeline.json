At this point I think I will not try fixing it for 2.10.x partly since it is resolved for 2.11, and partly since I suspect there is non-trivial risk for regression for 2.10.x. And mostly I guess as I really hope to get 2.11.0 released relatively soon (early Feb 2019).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/572689960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2935982390,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkzNTk4MjM5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2935982390","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T18:25:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/572705074","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2365#issuecomment-572705074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2365","id":572705074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjcwNTA3NA==","user":{"login":"LukasKarasek","id":30320091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzIwMDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30320091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek","html_url":"https://github.com/LukasKarasek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasKarasek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-09T19:00:06Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T19:00:06Z","body":"OK, thanks , I'll try when it will release .

Search before asking\r\n\r\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI'm using a thirdparty client that is deserializing json where an enum is made of variations like RGBA and RGBa. When upgrading our dependencies from Jackson 2.14.1 to 2.16.1 this API started failing with\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: Multiple fields representing property \"rgba\" ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n2.16.1 \r\n\r\nLooks like the bug was introduced in 2.16.0 as it works with 2.15.4\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static class Bug {\r\n        public enum ColorMode {\r\n            RGB, RGBa, RGBA\r\n        }\r\n        public ColorMode colorMode;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void enumFails() throws Exception {\r\n        String json = \"{ \\\"color_mode\\\": \\\"RGBa\\\"}\";\r\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n        mapper.setPropertyNamingStrategy(PropertyNamingStrategies.SNAKE_CASE);\r\n        mapper.disable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES);\r\n        Bug bug = mapper.readValue(json, Bug.class);\r\n    }\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThis should succeed.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nFor this particular, I worked around this issue right now by patching the objectmapper created within the client and adding a custom deserializer for that enum:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static class EnumDeserializer extends StdDeserializer<File.ColorMode> {\r\n        public EnumDeserializer() {\r\n            this(null);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public EnumDeserializer(Class<?> vc) {\r\n            super(vc);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public File.ColorMode deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException, JacksonException {\r\n            JsonNode node = p.getCodec().readTree(p);\r\n            String value = node.asText();\r\n            return value != null ? File.ColorMode.valueOf(value) : null;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // .... reflective access to find the objectmapper in the thirdparty client...\r\n    mapper.registerModule(new SimpleModule(\"patch-enum\")\r\n         .addDeserializer(File.ColorMode.class, new EnumDeserializer()));\r\n\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
