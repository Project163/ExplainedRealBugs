So this limitation is due to backwards compatibility (for 2.x)\n\nSo there are a few things to improve for 3.0:\n\n1. Should allow throwing exceptions, for case where no default is specified. We can now do this more easily as we throw unchecked exception -- meaning accessors are still safe with Java 8 streaming\n    * Jackson 3.0 now has `JsonNodeException` to use\n2. Should allow use of Java 8 `Optional`, as that is useful for `stream()` operations\n\nThis would lead to bigger set of methods, once again for `boolean`:\n\n1. `booleanValue()` as before, return value if JSON Boolean -- but if not, throw exception\n2. `booleanValue(boolean defaultValue)` as `booleanValue()` except returns `defaultValue` instead of exception\n3. `booleanValueOpt()` similar to `booleanValue()` but returns `Optional<Boolean>`, either present (as per `intValue()`) or absent (instead of exception)\n4. `asBoolean()` similar to `booleanValue()` but allows coercion from Integral numbers (0 == `false`, anything else `true`) and `String`, as well as `null` But if not, throw exception\n5. `asBooleanOpt()` like `asBoolean()` but returns `Optional<Boolean>`, either present (as per `asBoolean()`) or absent (instead of exception)\n\nWe should also do the same for `String` (by default `stringValue()` only for JSON String; `asString()` for all scalar-types but not Objects/Arrays).\n\nNOTE:\n\nIn addition to set for `boolean` there's:\n\n* `stringValue()`, `asString()`\n\nAnd there are some partial accessors to handle too:\n\n* `binaryValue()`\n\nNOTE 2:\n\nThis issue does NOT tackle `asXxx()` variants -- there's #5003 for that.\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
