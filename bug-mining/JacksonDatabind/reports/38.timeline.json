Right, the problem with array is that one is only instantiated after collecting all entries (since arrays are not resizable). With collections this may not be the case, so I should go back and add a reference if possible. I realize that non-type-safety between `Class` and instance is awkward, but sometimes that is best that can be done when deserializing (f.ex. if problem occurs during deserialization of creator parameter, or due to
