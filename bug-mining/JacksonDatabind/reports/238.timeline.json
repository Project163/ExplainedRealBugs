is not a good fix.\n\nFirst of all, you aren't returning the `result` map... but I just saw you fixed that in 50855c39f7c28e21e8466787f463f8c3eb0bfa3d so forget this point.\n\nSecondly, the value stored for `null` is lost. This is really bad. Data integrity should be way more important than the sorting of the keys.\n\nI've given this some more thoughts and I now think that the right way of fixing this issue would look like this:\n\n``` java\n    protected Map<?,?> _orderEntries(Map<?,?> input)\n    {\n        // minor optimization: may already be sorted?\n        if (input instanceof SortedMap<?,?>) {\n            return input;\n        }\n        try {\n            return new TreeMap<Object,Object>(input);\n        } catch (Throwable ignored) {\n            return input\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThis would also cover the case were keys aren't `Comparable` (see `TreeMap.compare(Object k1, Object k2)` called by `put(K key, V value)` which would throw a `ClassCastException` in that case).\n\nCatching `Throwable` instead of explicitly catching `ClassCastException` and `NullPointerException` would have the advantage that it would also eat `OutOfMemoryException` (in case of huge maps that won't fit into memory twice) and any unexpected exceptions caused by buggy implementations of the `Comparable` interface.\n\nI'm usually not a fan of using exceptions for logic but  think this is an exception to the rule since it would impose zero performance overhead in the \"good\" case while still returning correct, albeit unsorted, values in the \"bad\" case.\n\nSorry I didn't catch the problem before the 2.8.4 release.

I wasn't aware that `null` is an invalid key in JSON. That changes the problem quite a bit.\n\nAn `ObjectMapper` without `SerializationFeature.ORDER_MAP_ENTRIES_BY_KEYS` enabled would currently throw a `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerationException: Null key for a Map not allowed in JSON (use a converting NullKeySerializer?)` by default, but it looks like this can be changed...\n\nEnabling or disabling `ORDER_MAP_ENTRIES_BY_KEYS` should not change anything other than the order, so the remainder of the serialization logic should still behave the same, i.e. use a `NullKeySerializer` if available and any registered `keySerializer` for complex types.\n\nWe are talking about new behavior here:\nA `null` key has previously generated a `NullPointerException` and keys that did not implement `Comparable` caused a `ClassCastException` with `ORDER_MAP_ENTRIES_BY_KEYS` enabled. So people that previously stumbled over this problem likely already disabled this option in their code. We aren't dealing with something that suddenly produces different, unsorted output but with something that would suddenly produce unsorted output instead of causing an exception. So this most likely isn't causing compatibility issues, at least. We are talking about currently undefined (AFAIK) behavior that you could fix by defining it.\n\nI'd suggest that you document over at `ORDER_MAP_ENTRIES_BY_KEYS` that this is only a best-effort option, i.e. that it will only have an effect if there is no `null` key and if the keys implement `Comparable`. That would be fair game and just catching any exception during construction of the `TreeMap`, returning to unsorted `Map`, would provide the effect that all the other `Map`-serialization-logic configured by the user would still have the chance to kick in.\n\nMy rationale for this is that `ORDER_MAP_ENTRIES_BY_KEYS` is (AFAIK) a \"global\" setting of `ObjectMapper` so it's not possible (again, AFAIK) to say \"Please sort this map in my object but not that map\". So defining `ORDER_MAP_ENTRIES_BY_KEYS` as a best-effort option would still behave reasonable in most cases and put the ball in the ballpark of the developer using the library in the edge-cases we are talking about right now.\n\nI'm just trying to be helpful here, throwing my brain and 2 cents into your brainstorming pool, but you are way deeper involved in the topic than I am so I'm not sure about the actual value of my rambling. This isn't meant as a \"I am right and you are wrong!\" argument at all.\n\nI also feel sorry about the whole issue since I was the one who originally suggested `ORDER_MAP_ENTRIES_BY_KEYS` to you... it was only meant to make generated JSON more easily consumable by humans. If you had told me to just \"use a SortedMap in your data if you want that\" back then, then you wouldn't have this problem now... So I kind of feel responsible for your current misery/ambivalence.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/254040045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"huxi","id":119647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTY0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi","html_url":"https://github.com/huxi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/254115227","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1411#issuecomment-254115227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1411","id":254115227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDExNTIyNw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-17T05:24:02Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T05:24:02Z","body":"Actually there is per-property override also using\n\n```\n@JsonFormat(with = JsonFormat.Feature.WRITE_SORTED_MAP_ENTRIES)\n```\n\nI think I do have an idea of what to do with null entry...
