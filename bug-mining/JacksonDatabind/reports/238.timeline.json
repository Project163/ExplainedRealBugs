Right, so default should only apply to non-annotated properties, but would then \"override\" setting of `false` in a sense. Or put another way: having setting as `false would NOT prevent class annotation from taking effect.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/288559838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1011407134,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTAxMTQwNzEzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1011407134","actor":{"login":"sdeleuze","id":141109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze","html_url":"https://github.com/sdeleuze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-22T22:29:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1011407135,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwMTE0MDcxMzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1011407135","actor":{"login":"sdeleuze","id":141109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze","html_url":"https://github.com/sdeleuze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdeleuze/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-22T22:29:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/477066333","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/507#issuecomment-477066333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/507","id":477066333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzA2NjMzMw==","user":{"login":"yugander-krishan-singh","id":20454909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDU0OTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20454909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh","html_url":"https://github.com/yugander-krishan-singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/event

 I am a  bit confused about class-level @JsonView annotation.\r\nAfter going throught he above discussions thread I tried the class-level @JsonView annotations. \r\nFirst, I have disabled DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION in Object mapper. Now I have a class level JsonView annotation(with default view class) on my Entity class which has both annotated and non-annotated fields.\r\n\r\nNow when I serialize my entity class by passing the default view class I am not getting the non-annotated fields of the class in the output.  \r\nBut when I enable DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION again the o/p is as expected. \r\nIt seems the **class-level @JsonView** annotation has no effect on the o/p.\r\n\r\nPls have a look at this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/55371168/6407858) question which is not exactly same but similar.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/477066333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yugander-krishan-singh","id":20454909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDU0OTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20454909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh","html_url":"https://github.com/yugander-krishan-singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugander-krishan-singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2232477443,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIzMjQ3NzQ0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2232477443","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-27T09:46:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
