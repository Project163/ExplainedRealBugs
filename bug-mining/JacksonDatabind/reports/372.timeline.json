Anything related to Lombok has to be expanded as no tests can rely on Lombok (it is one of dependencies I explicitly rule out), so result of its class processing need to be expanded, to the degree they are relevant. In this case I think it may add `@ConstructorProperties` annotation at least, as well as setters/getters.\r\n\r\nBut I think I may be able to add implied annotations and constructor.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/382470713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1582035612,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU4MjAzNTYxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1582035612","actor":{"login":"OndraZizka","id":644904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDkwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/644904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka","html_url":"https://github.com/OndraZizka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-18T17:44:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1582035613,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1ODIwMzU2MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1582035613","actor":{"login":"OndraZizka","id":644904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDkwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/644904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka","html_url":"https://github.com/OndraZizka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-18T17:44:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/382573100","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1999#issuecomment-382573100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1999","id":382573100,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjU3MzEwMA==","user":{"login":"OndraZizka","id":644904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDkwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/644904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka","html_url":"https://github.com/OndraZizka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndraZizka/r
