the bug**\r\nWhen deserializing a Java Record with `@JsonAnySetter` annotated field the field is left as null and the unmapped values are ignored. Given the nature of Java records, there is no other way to get the unmapped fields values (like in case of annotating a setter method).\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.13.2.2\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```java\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonAnySetter;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\n\r\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;\r\n\r\npublic class JsonAnySetterRecordTest {\r\n\r\n    record TestRecord(\r\n        @JsonProperty String field,\r\n        @JsonAnySetter Map<String, Object> anySetter\r\n    ) {}\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testJsonAnySetterOnRecord() throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n        var json = \"\"\"\r\n            {\r\n                \"field\": \"value\",\r\n                \"unmapped1\": \"value1\",\r\n                \"unmapped2\": \"value2\"\r\n            }\r\n            \"\"\";\r\n\r\n        var objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\r\n        var deserialized = objectMapper.readValue(json, TestRecord.class);\r\n\r\n        assertEquals(\"value\", deserialized.field());\r\n        assertEquals(Map.of(\"unmapped1\", \"value1\", \"unmapped2\", \"value2\"), deserialized.anySetter());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this test the result will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExpected :{unmapped1=value1, unmapped2=value2}\r\nActual   :null\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe `@JsonAnySetter` annotated field should contain a Map instance with all unmapped fields and their values.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe problem happens in `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.SettableAnyProperty` class in method `set(...)`. The value of the  `@JsonAnySetter` annotated field is null and therefore setting the property value is skipped. \r\n\r\nThe suggested solution would be for Java Record to provide a new empty Map instance for the annotated field to gather the unmapped properties and this would then be provided to Record's constructor when the deserialization is concluded. Given the immutable nature of Java Records, this should ideally be some kind of immutable Map implementation (i.e. `Map.copyOf(...)` ?)\r\n\r\nThere might be a workaround (which however won't be probably feasible in all cases) by supplying an additional `@JsonCreator` constructor or factory method, where the `@JsonAnySetter` field is initialized to an empty map and then to ensure the immutability, the getter for this map needs to be overridden and the value returned wrapped as immutable.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nrecord TestRecord(\r\n        String field,\r\n        @JsonAnySetter Map<String, Object> anySetter\r\n    ) {\r\n\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        TestRecord(@JsonProperty(\"field\") String field) {\r\n            this(field, new HashMap<>());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Map<String, Object> anySetter() {\r\n            return Collections.unmodifiableMap(anySetter);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3439/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3439/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2243907211","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4634#issuecomment-2243907211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4634","id":2243907211,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c6Fv06L","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-22T22:19:13Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T22:19:13Z","body":"Ok; with regular accessors there is clearly define precedence so Constructor parameter has precedence over Setter which has precedence over Field.
