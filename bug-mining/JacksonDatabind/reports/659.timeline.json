And in this case there is no suppression of writing type id.\r\nThis is not specific to `enum`s I think, but does affect them.\r\n\r\nI'll have to think of best way to tackle the issue; instead of using an existing `TypeSerializer` maybe it's better to create new \"NoTypeSerializer\" or

working on a JSON:API utility library and experimenting with ways to handle its remarkably flexible polymorphism. In this case, I am trying to model [links](https://jsonapi.org/format/1.1/#document-links), where the value can be either an `object` or a `string` representing a URI.\r\n\r\nMy initial attempt (which would not entirely work for other reasons) was as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@JsonTypeInfo(use = DEDUCTION)\r\n@JsonSubTypes({\r\n    @Type(JsonApiLink.BareUri.class),\r\n    @Type(JsonApiLink.LinkObject.class),\r\n})\r\npublic abstract class JsonApiLink {\r\n    public abstract URI getHref();\r\n\r\n    @Data\r\n    @EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)\r\n    public static class BareUri extends JsonApiLink {\r\n        @JsonValue\r\n        URI href;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Data\r\n    @EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)\r\n    public static class LinkObject extends JsonApiLink {\r\n        URI href;\r\n\r\n        String rel;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInvoking `jackson.writeValueAsString(new LinkObject(href: uri))` produces the expected \"JSON object in a Java string\" with no type information, but when I attempt to call `jackson.writeValueAsString(new BareUri(uri))`, I get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\"com.example.jsonapi.links.JsonApiLink$BareUri\",\"https://links.test/d3a99621-971b-40b1-b8e4-cbbdd3299602\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears that `TypeSerializerRerouter` is invoked from `ToStringSerializerBase#serializeWithType`, swaps the `@JsonValue`'s strategy for the subtype's strategy, and then `JsonGenerator` forgets the `DEDUCTION` instruction and imposes a default of `WRAPPER_ARRAY` (`JsonGenerator.java:1934` in 2.13.2).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1373326811","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3711#issuecomment-1373326811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3711","id":1373326811,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c5R203b","user":{"login":"smilep","id":7077727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzc3Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7077727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep","html_url":"https://github.com/smilep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smilep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-06T08:08:25Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T08:08:25Z","body":"@cowtowncoder Thanks.

Search before asking\n\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn v2.14.2 AsDeductionTypeSerializer was introduced. \r\nPrior to this we could define an immutable interface as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Nullable\r\n    @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.DEDUCTION)\r\n    /* Complex/ nested classes should be added to this list for Jackson to check */\r\n    @JsonSubTypes({\r\n            @JsonSubTypes.Type(StoreField.class),\r\n            @JsonSubTypes.Type(StringArray.class),\r\n            @JsonSubTypes.Type(NumberArray.class),\r\n            @JsonSubTypes.Type(QueryRequest.class) })\r\n    T getValue();\r\n``` \r\n\r\nand set a value of LocalDate, LocalDateTime, OffsetDateTime etc as the return of `getValue()`\r\n\r\nThis would serialize correctly with `JsonMapper.builder().disable(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS)` set.\r\n\r\nWe now get a \"Cannot read field 'valueShape'\" exception because `AsDeductionTypeSerializer`  returns null if the `WritableTypeId.valueShape` is not a structure start token.\r\nThis results in an NPE within the `LocalDateTimeSerializer` class on line 89;\r\n```java\r\n if (typeIdDef.valueShape == JsonToken.START_ARRAY) {\r\n``` \n\n### Version Information\n\n2.14.2\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```java\r\n\r\n@Value.Immutable\r\n@JsonSerialize(as = ImmutableQueryPredicate.class)\r\n@JsonDeserialize(as = ImmutableQueryPredicate.class)\r\npublic interface QueryPredicate<T> extends Serializable {\r\n\r\n    @Nullable\r\n    @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.DEDUCTION)\r\n    /* Complex/ nested classes should be added to this list for Jackson to check */\r\n    @JsonSubTypes({\r\n            @JsonSubTypes.Type(StoreField.class),\r\n            @JsonSubTypes.Type(StringArray.class),\r\n            @JsonSubTypes.Type(NumberArray.class),\r\n            @JsonSubTypes.Type(QueryRequest.class) })\r\n    T getValue();\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n``` \r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testSerialiseLocalDatePredicate() {\r\n\r\n        final QueryPredicate<LocalDateTime> dateTimePredicate = ImmutableQueryPredicate.<LocalDateTime>builder()\r\n                .value(LocalDateTime.of(2022, 06, 24, 10, 23, 51))\r\n                .build();\r\n\r\n        final String asString = mapper.writeValueAsString(dateTimePredicate);\r\n}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf deduction cannot find the class it should return default property behaviour.\n\n### Additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3711#issuecomment-1371580012","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
