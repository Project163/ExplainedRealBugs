yes, I think you are right wrt delegation, methods are missing. And I suppose calling of `Converter` makes sense as well. There are a few other methods missing too so it'd make sense to address those as well.\r\n\r\nI think this would qualify to be in 2.14(.2).\r\n\r\nI can probably work on this, time permitting, to get it in 2.14.2. Or if you want to do PR, happy to review. Methods from `JsonSerializer` that seem to be missing:\r\n\r\n* `isCachable`\r\n* `getKnownPropertyNames`\r\n* `unwrappingDeserializer` (may need to re-construct delegating one itself)\r\n* `replaceDelegatee` (not sure this is actually used anywhere but...)\r\n* `getNullValue` / `getNullAccessPattern`\r\n* `getAbsentValue`\r\n* `getEmptyValue` / `getEmptyAccessPattern` \r\n* `getObjectIdReader`\r\n* `findBackReference`\r\n\r\nSo I think all of those should delegate. Although one way to reduce risk would be to only delegate `getXxxValue()`/`getXxxAccessPattern()` calls for 2.14(.2), and the rest in 2.15.\r\nAlthough I am not sure why delegation should break anything it might still be safest.\r\n\r\nIdeally we'd also have unit tests for these which adds to work.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1387615491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8258955955,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAC5e2c5bpOcZzwAAAAHsRaqz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/8258955955","actor":{"login":"k163377","id":24751011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzUxMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24751011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377","html_url":"https://github.com/k163377","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-18T19:06:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8258955966,"node_id":"SE_lADOAC5e2c5bpOcZzwAAAAHsRaq-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/8258955966","actor":{"login":"k163377","id":24751011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzUxMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24751011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377","html_url":"https://github.com/k163377","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-18T19:06:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1399381960","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3741#issuecomment-1399381960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3741","id":1399381960,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c5TaN_I","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at
