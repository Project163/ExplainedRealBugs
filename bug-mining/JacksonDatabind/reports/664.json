the bug**\r\n`StdDelegatingDeserializer` does not properly override methods such as `getNullValue`.\r\nThis prevents `Converter` from working when the value is `null`.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.14.1\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI think I can read it from the source code, but I will write it if necessary.\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/ae3ca887c589e075ed13ea0665ac9bf22c0517a9/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/std/StdDelegatingDeserializer.java\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`override` a method such as `getNullValue` and call `Converter` if the result of such a method call to `_delegateDeserializer` is not `null`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThere was a situation where the `value class` deserialization in `jackson-module-kogera` needed to be enabled.\r\nhttps://github.com/ProjectMapK/jackson-module-kogera","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
