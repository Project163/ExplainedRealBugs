Search before asking\n\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nDeserialisation doesn't work as expected in case of several Json Creators are defined on a class ( PROPERTIES and DELEGATED), and the delegating one is accepting a `List` as an argument and represents the single mandatory property of the class. \r\n\r\nIt's expected that the PROPERTIES deserializer will be used, but the deserialisation process opts for the delegating deserialiser despite JSON definition being provided as Object.\n\n### Version Information\n\n2.16.1\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI have the following class definition for a JSON object:\r\n```\r\nclass MyDefinition {\r\n  List<StepDefinition> steps;\r\n  ExtraProperties extra;\r\n\r\n  @JsonCreator(mode = JsonCreator.Mode.PROPERTIES)\r\n  public MyDefinition(@JsonProperty(\"steps\") List<StepDefinition> steps, @JsonProperty(\"extra\") ExtraProperties extra) {\r\n     this.steps = steps;\r\n     this.extra = extra;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @JsonCreator(mode = JsonCreator.Mode.DELEGATING)\r\n  public static MyDefinition of(List<StepDefinition> steps) {\r\n    return new MyDefinition(steps, null);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nClasses `StepDefinition` and `ExtraProperties` are simple class with straight-forward mapping.\r\n\r\nI annotated the `MyDefinition` class in such a way, so it could handle mapping for the following two cases of JSON:\r\n\r\nCase 1:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"myDefinition\": {\r\n    \"steps\": [ { \"step\": \"some\" } ], \r\n    \"extra\": { \"prop\": \"value\" }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCase 2:\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  \"myDefinition\": [\r\n    { \"step\": \"some\" }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe deserialisation for the \"PROPERTIES\" case (Case 1)  fails on trying to deserialise \"extra\" property value as `StepDefinition` type.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'd expect that the PROPERTIES deserialiser is used in case the object is provided with a bunch of properties.\n\n### Additional context\n\nA similar mapping scenario works in case the delegating factory method accepts `String` as a value (not a list).\r\n\r\nMy mapper is created using `YAMLFactory` and the failure occurs on parsing YAML.\r\nThe mapper has `DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_SINGLE_VALUE_AS_ARRAY` feature enabled, and is configured with `ParameterNamesModule`\r\n\r\nI guess it could be important to mention that I also use Lombok.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4602/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
