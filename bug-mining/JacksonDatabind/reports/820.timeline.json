related to the upgrade of jackson dependencies from 2.17.3 to 2.18.2\nDeserialization is not working anymore for a class with 2 constructor, one with @JsonCreator annotation.\n\nIt fails with this exception:\n```\nInstantiation of [simple type, class User] value failed for JSON property fullName due to missing (therefore NULL) value for creator parameter fullName which is a non-nullable type\n at [Source: REDACTED (`StreamReadFeature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` disabled); line: 6, column: 13] (through reference chain:

seems it take the wrong constructor, I also try with `@JsonIgnore` and `@JsonCreator(mode=DISABLED)` on the first constructor but it didn't help.\nAny idea on how to solve this issue?\n\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n\nProject with failing test can be found on this repo https://github.com/fabienfleureau/jackson-deserialization-issue/\n\nI have defined this class:\n```kotlin\nclass User(\n    val age: Int,\n    fullName: String,\n) {\n    var firstName: String = fullName.split(\" \").first()\n    var lastName: String = fullName.split(\" \").last()\n\n    fun fullName() = \"$firstName $lastName\"\n\n    @JsonCreator\n    constructor(): this(\n        age = 0,\n        fullName = \"John Doe\",\n    )\n}\n```\n\nand the json to deserialize looks like this:\n```json\n            {\n                \"age\": 25,\n                \"firstName\": \"Jane\",\n                \"lastName\": \"Doe\"\n            }\n```\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expected to have a user deserialized having age set to 25, firstName set to Jane and lastName set to Doe\n\n### Versions\n\nKotlin: 2.1\nJackson-module-kotlin: 2.18.3\nJackson-databind: 2.18.3\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nalso created an issue in databind https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5040 but someone suggested to ask

be better to assert (I know, there's now exception instead, but eventually this should work).\n\nI think the problem probably has to do with special handling of \"default\" (0-args) construct (note: \"findDefaultCreator()\" is bad name, renamed in 3.0 as \"findPreferredCreator\".\nIt should be recognized, I suppose, as Properties-based one.\nBut unfortunately there is some specific code for use
