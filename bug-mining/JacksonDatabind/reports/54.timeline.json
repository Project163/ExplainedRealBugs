This is not ideal, but is required to support (more) efficient handling of the common case for polymorphic types, in which first value pair contains type id, and addition of leading `{` would require merging of additional stream.\nThis is not an ideal state of things, and in cases where content is to be reconstructed, it would be better to reconstruct the whole value.\n\nAlso, since `TokenBuffer` could contain any JSON value, this is bit of a gray area.\n\nHowever, all relevant values should be contained, so missing `\"b\":null` pair.\n\nAlso: as you point out, due to the way `copyCurrentStructure` works, this won't behave properly, so I think handling is not as intended. There is a bug somewhere. :)\nI'm not sure which parts need to be changed, but with given example case it should be possible to figure out proper handling here.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/60777871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/60798172","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/592#issuecomment-60798172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/592","id":60798172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNzk4MTcy","user":{"login":"elucash","id":1692611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTI2MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1692611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash","html_url":"https://github.com/elucash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elucash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-28T17:39:22Z","updated_at":"2014-10-28T17:41:38Z","body":"Thank you for the explanation. I solved somewhat similar problems in generated marshalers by always require that marshaler expects current token to be the first token as a precondition and leaves parser on a last token as a post condition and with some temporary copying to buffer for a polymorphic deserialization, but it's definitely not trivial having a lot of different deserializers.\n\nAs a workaround for my usecase, I
