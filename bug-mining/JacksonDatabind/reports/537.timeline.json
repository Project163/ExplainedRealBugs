for your insight David.\r\n\r\n@cowtowncoder , I've essentially got a recursive parsing issue. I'd like my json structure to reference a file, which in turn is this parsed w/ the same mapper as the original.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"file\": \"/tmp/the-real-type.json\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy hope was to inject ObjectMapper and use that (after registering as injectable value):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@JsonCreator\r\npublic static RefType create(\r\n  @JacksonInject ObjectMapper mapper,\r\n  @JsonProperty(value = \"file\") File reference) throws IOException {\r\n  return new RefType(mapper.readValue(reference, RealType.class));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I was getting the same error as seen here (and a few other places).\r\n\r\nMy workaround for now is to use a custom deserializer:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic RefType deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt)\r\n  throws IOException, JsonProcessingException {\r\n  final ObjectMapper mapper = (ObjectMapper) p.getCodec(); // hacky\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a more idiomatic way to accomplish
