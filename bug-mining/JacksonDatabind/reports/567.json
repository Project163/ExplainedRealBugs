the bug**\r\nWhen serializing a map key, if the key's type uses `@JsonValue` on one of its attributes, and if that attribute's type uses `@JsonValue` on one of its own attributes, the second `@JsonValue` is ignored, and `toString()` is used instead.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.10.0\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```java\r\n    class Inner {\r\n\r\n        @JsonValue\r\n        String string;\r\n\r\n        Inner(String string) {\r\n            this.string = string;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public String toString() {\r\n            return \"Inner(String=\"+this.string+\")\";\r\n
