It seems `InvalidFormatException` would be a good fit here, with the benefit of programmatically exposing the value that failed conversion.\r\n\r\nI noticed this since I've added some custom handling in my application for `InvalidFormatException`/`MismatchedInputException` to provide terser/more user-appropriate errors.  Since this scenario throws `MismatchedInputException`, I cannot programmatically retrieve the JSON value that failed to serialize.  If it did implement `InvalidFormatException`, I could use [`InvalidFormatException.getValue()`](https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.11/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/exc/InvalidFormatException.html#getValue--) to get the value.\r\n\r\nNote: This same reasoning applies to other similar features, such as `ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS` & `FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES`.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
