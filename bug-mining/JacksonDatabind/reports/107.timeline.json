just got hit by this as well. It also seems counter-intuitive to me to treat zero valued ints and doubles as \"empty\". Furthermore based on my tests a zero valued Double (_object not primitive_) is also treated as empty which is very perplexing since **Double doesn't have a default value** (other than null).\n\nSo if you serialize a Double whose value is 0.0 using JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY the value will disappear entirely in serialized form, and then when you attempt to deserialize the output, the deserialized value will be null.\n\nAlso consider a corner case where the field is a string, but the getter returns a double. \n\n``` java\nprivate String riskScore;\n\npublic double getRiskScore(){\n    return Double.parseDouble(riskScore);\n}\n```\n\nUsing the default serialization (or a pre-2.6 version of jackson) a string value of \"0.0\" would be serialized to a Json Number (0.0) and then deserialized back to the original string without issue. However now the 0.0 double is thrown away during serialization and then after serialization you end up with a null string.\n\nI am all for making things more flexible with a custom inclusion definition, but these new defaults of discarding ints and doubles definitely don't seem intuitive to me.

Ideally a version  2.6.x would come out with a fix, reverting to the previous behaviour of NON_EMPTY.  I think the fundemental concept of NON_EMPTY has been misunderstood. NON_EMTPY is just not a concept that applies to real primitives, they always have a default value.  So with auto-unboxing it is imperitive to not apply NON_EMPTY to the boxed versions.  Version prior to 2.6.0 cope with this correctly.\n\nBelow is a fully runnable example, hopefully illustrating the seriousness of this change.  I've also included some additional fields, that show why simply removing the NON_EMPTY serialisation option is not the solution - as you can't keep the same payload structure between version 2.5.4 and 2.6.\n\n``` java\npackage com.testcomp;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude.Include;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n\npublic class PrimitiveHandlingIssue {\n\n    public static class IntegerIssue {      \n\n        public IntegerIssue(){}\n\n        private List<String> shouldntSerialise;\n        private String alsoShouldntSerialise;\n\n        private Integer mustSerialise;\n\n        public Integer getMustSerialise() {\n            return mustSerialise;\n        }\n\n        public void setMustSerialise(Integer mustSerialise) {\n            this.mustSerialise = mustSerialise;\n        }\n\n        public List<String> getShouldntSerialise() {\n            return shouldntSerialise;\n        }\n\n        public void setShouldntSerialise(List<String> shouldntSerialise) {\n            this.shouldntSerialise = shouldntSerialise;\n        }\n\n        public String getAlsoShouldntSerialise() {\n            return alsoShouldntSerialise;\n        }\n\n        public void setAlsoShouldntSerialise(String alsoShouldntSerialise) {\n            this.alsoShouldntSerialise = alsoShouldntSerialise;\n        }\n\n    }   \n\n    /**\n     * Run this test on both version 2.5.4 and 2.6.0 to see the behaviour difference.\n     * @param args\n     * @throws Exception\n     */\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n        //Comment the line below to see the behaviour of this field across version 2.5.4 and 2.6.0.\n        //see how it behaves correctly in 2.5.4.  In 2.6.0 a fundemental error has been made.\n        //NON_EMPTY is not a concept that can apply to real primitives, as they always have a default, and you can't tell whether they where set to the default or not.\n        mapper.setSerializationInclusion(Include.NON_EMPTY);\n\n        PrimitiveHandlingIssue.IntegerIssue phiBefore = new PrimitiveHandlingIssue.IntegerIssue();\n        phiBefore.setMustSerialise(0);\n\n        phiBefore.setShouldntSerialise(new ArrayList<String>());\n\n\n        String js = mapper.writeValueAsString(phiBefore);\n        System.out.println(js);\n\n        PrimitiveHandlingIssue.IntegerIssue phiAfter = mapper.readValue(js, PrimitiveHandlingIssue.IntegerIssue.class);\n        //Here is the now unavoidable NULL POINTER caused by this bug.\n        System.out.println(phiAfter.getMustSerialise() * 2);\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nCurrently I'm struggle to upgrade from version 2.4.1 to 2.6.+ - as I can't find a version that doesn't have some form of bug/odd feature.  I'm trying to upgrade to get the JsonTypeInfo.As.EXISTING_PROPERTY but have so far hit 2 major reasons not to use 2.6.+.  Unfortunately version 2.5+ are also unusable as they do not allow multiple named types refering to the same subclass (something fixed in version 2.6).\n\nWould it be possible to have a 2.6.x patch for this issues (too many other issues/major changes with 2.7 at the moment to conisder making that leap).\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/166458960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knightweb","id":16388403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzg4NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16388403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb","html_url":"https://github.com/knightweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":497980193,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk3OTgwMTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/497980193","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-21T23:38:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":497980194,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5Nzk4MDE5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/497980194","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-21T23:38:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/166461624","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/849#issuecomment-166461624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/849","id":166461624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjQ2MTYyNA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncod

It is unfortunate that your use case happens to touch these disparate items, making upgrade much more difficult than it should be.\n\nAs to 2.7, it is sort of half-way version. 2 core components -- `jackson-annotations` and `jackson-core` should still only require Java 6, whereas others will require Java 7. But even with that:\n1. Java 7 should only be needed to build Jackson 2.7 components (other than annotations, streaming)\n2. Java 6 runtime should be enough to use `jackson-databind`, and most other modules; exceptions are modules for datatypes not included in Java 6 (like Java 8 datetime (jsr-310)) or that require Java 7 (HPPC)\n3. No Java 7 language constructs are yet used (they will be used in 2.8)\n4. Java 7 datatypes supported by `jackson-databind` are all dynamically loaded, and should downgrade gracefully (there is just 1 new value type, and 2 annotation types)\n\nSo... it's bit unclean from
