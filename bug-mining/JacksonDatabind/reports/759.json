If so, a POJO with `buf` and `length` fields were produced.\r\nWith 2.13 the default visibility settings for JDK types were changed to only detect `public` accessors; this also prevents custom default visibility from being applied. As a result, `ByteArrayOutputStream` values are no longer serializable.\r\n\r\nBut it might make sense to make it serializable again. However, the representation as POJO does not make sense: if serialization is to be used, it should:\r\n\r\n1. Use public `ByteArrayOutStream.toByteArray()` to access content\r\n2. Serialize contents as a Binary value: for JSON backend this means Base64-encoded String; for other backends whatever their representation of Binary values is\r\n\r\nI realize that this behavior is different from the earlier one so it is an open question if this should be deferred until Jackson 3.0.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
