I am bit torn on whether allowing extension by sub-classing is a good thing or not (ideally it should not be used), partly because it will then further limit implementation aspects of standard (de)serializers as internal methods become part of semi-public API.\r\n\r\nOn  `NumberSerializers.Base`: is there particular need for this? As in, specific immediate problem, or just general wish that this would allow easier implementation of support for other numeric types?\r\nSince it is geared towards support for JDK primitive/wrapper types (... although I guess it may also support `BigDecimal` / `BigInteger`? it has been a while since I looked into this) it is not necessarily designed for extensibility at this point.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/414394290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1798234170,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3OTgyMzQxNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1798234170","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-20T17:17:06Z","label":{"name":"2.10","color":"006b75"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/414564070","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2116#issuecomment-414564070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2116","id":414564070,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDU2NDA3MA==","user":{"login":"edouardmercier","id":82481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardmercier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardmercier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-21T06:28:27Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T06:28:27Z","body":"I understand your point regarding the default serialization behavior in Java and about the fact that opening too much the code sometimes leads to bad usage.\r\n\r\nMaybe subclassing is not the right choice and that you may do this by delegation.\r\n\r\nRegarding `NumberSerializers.Base`, you are right: if `NumberSerializers.FloatSerializer` is not final anymore, then I will be able to override the `JsonSerializer.serialize(Object value, JsonGenerator generator, SerializerProvider provider)` method, hence you do not need to have it public.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, an API like Jackson should have a descent behavior — which is the case — but should be enough open so that you may change this behavior, at your own risks.
