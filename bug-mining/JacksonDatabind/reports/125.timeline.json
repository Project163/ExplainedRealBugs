from #943)\n\nAlthough it is possible to add local caching for key serializers of `Map` types, it may make sense to also add global cache, used via `SerializerProvider.findKeySerializer(...)`. This would reduce cost of lookup misses from local cache, or eliminate need for local caches altogether.\n\nThe reason caching is important, in general, is that due to extensive configuration via annotations, modular extension mechanisms, optional contextualization and other advanced feature, the actual lookup by type is rather a complicated process. So instead of trying to go crazy optimizing lookups (which may or may not even be possible; any module can request callbacks to be done during lookups) it often makes sense to make sure resulting handler is cached for future (dynamic) lookups.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/947/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":420406638,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyMDQwNjYzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/420406638","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9566ea8e2cebff0081b6a6df90370ada20aaccc9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/9566ea8e2cebff0081b6a6df90370ada20aaccc9","created_at":"2015-09-28T05:52:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":420406751,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDIwNDA2NzUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/420406751","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"9566ea8e2cebff0081b6a6df90370ada20aaccc9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/9566ea8e2cebff0081b6a6df90370ada20aaccc9","created_at":"2015-09-28T05:52:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":420406807,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQyMDQwNjgwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/420406807","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-28T05:52:29Z","milestone":{"title":"2.6.3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/143646152","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/943#issuecomment-143646152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/943","id":143646152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzY0NjE1Mg==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.c

able to implement a dynamic key serializer based on ideas bounced on dev list. Key serializer is used if nominal type is detected as `Object.class`; assumption (for now) being that if a more specific type is passed, there is a reason for that. That part of the logic may be improved later on if and as needed.\nFor now local caching (within serializer) is done using `PropertySerializerMap`, but I also created an issue for possible adding a higher-level caching, similar to existing value serializer caches. This would help with the cases where `Map`s exist where number of distinct types for keys is large, and where `PropertySerializerMap` does not perform well (it is designed for lowish number of choices).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/143646152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":422526612,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyMjUyNjYxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/422526612","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"04cb084c913e82414a7e92803cd037f0169450d6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/04cb084c913e82414a7e92803cd037f0169450d6","created_at":"2015-09-30T00:10:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-14T18:13:44Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T18:13:44Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3972","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3972/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3972/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3972/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3972","id":1749290478,"node_id":"I_kwDOAC5e2c5oRA3u","number":3972,"title":"Stack

Refer to the solution of jackson-databind: Add the depth variable to record the current parsing depth. If the parsing depth exceeds a certain threshold, an exception is thrown. (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/fcfc4998ec23f0b1f7f8a9521c2b317b6c25892b)\r\n\r\n2. Refer to the GSON solution: Change the recursive processing on deeply nested arrays or JSON objects to stack+iteration processing.(（https://github.com/google/gson/commit/2d01d6a20f39881c692977564c1ea591d9f39027）)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/jettison-json/jettison/issues/52 \r\n2. https://github.com/jettison-json/jettison/pull/53/files","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3972/reactions","total_count":36,"+1":0,"-1":36,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
