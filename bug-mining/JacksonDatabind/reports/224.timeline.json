currently valid to add the `@JsonCreator` annotation to an enum constructor, but that doesn't \"do\" anything. This might confuse users (it did confuse me when I found an occurrence in our code):\n- If an enum has a static method `@JsonCreator` then that method will be called upon each deserialization, while by definition an enum's constructor is invoked only once for each enum value.\n- Multi-param static method `@JsonCreator`s yield an `IllegalArgumentException` (see also #929), but `@JsonCreator`-annotated enum constructors with multiple parameters don't.\n- In combination with a `@JsonValue`-annotated method there may even be a mismatch between the number and types of arguments accepted by the constructor (this is the scenario I found in our code): it's unclear then what Jackson will do. (Until one realizes that the constructor's `@JsonCreator` annotation is bogus. That took me a while to figure out and is the reason I'm filing this issue.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1272/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":791557205,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzkxNTU3MjA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/791557205","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"129f9ba1abd5ed3a5d0f74c8270130c3715443ba","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/129f9ba1abd5ed3a5d0f74c8270130c3715443ba","created_at":"2016-09-16T01:15:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":791562945,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NzkxNTYyOTQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/791562945","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-16T01:24:46Z","label":{"name":"2.9","color":"0e8a16"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":791562972,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDc5MTU2Mjk3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/791562972","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-16T01:24:49Z","milestone":{"title":"2.8.3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":791564154,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc5MTU2NDE1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/791564154","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder
