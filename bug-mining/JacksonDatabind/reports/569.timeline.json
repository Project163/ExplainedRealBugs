the bug**\r\nIn upgrading to 2.12.5 from Spring Boot 2.4.9's Jackson version (2.11.4), I realized an object is getting serialized differently than it was before.\r\nI am using `mapper.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY)` on my mapper.\r\nThe object I want serialized has a `@JsonValue` annotation on a String returning method. In 2.11.4, when the return value of that method returns a blank string `\"\"`, it is serialized. In 2.12.5, the `\"\"` is not serialized. \r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nWhich Jackson version(s) was this for?\r\nJackson 2.11.4 --> Jackson 2.12.5.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nMy testing code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// parent class\r\n@Data\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\nstatic class ParentObj {\r\n    private SimpleTestObject simpleObj;\r\n    private int num;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// problem class\r\n@Data\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\nstatic class SimpleTestObject {\r\n    private String str;\r\n\r\n    @JsonValue\r\n    public String toString() {\r\n        return str;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Call the following for the 2 Jackson versions ...\r\n// ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n// mapper.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY);\r\n\r\n// SimpleTestObject obj = new SimpleTestObject() ...  [and modify its string for different calls]\r\n// ParentObj parent = new ParentObj(obj, 1);\r\n// print mapper.writeValueAsString(parent)\r\n\r\n// Results in 2.11.4: \r\n// with str = null --> \"{\"simpleObj\":null,\"num\":1}\"\r\n// with str = \"\" (empty string) --> \"{\"simpleObj\":\"\",\"num\":1}\"\r\n// with str = \"hi\" --> \"{\"simpleObj\":\"hi\",\"num\":1}\"\r\n\r\n// Results in 2.12.5\r\n// with str = null --> \"{\"num\":1}\"\r\n// with str = \"\" (empty string) --> \"{\"num\":1}\"\r\n// with str = \"hi\" --> \"{\"simpleObj\":\"hi\",\"num\":1}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIs this expected?  For what it's worth, the serialization is the SAME across versions when `@JsonValue` is not used.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI looked for some sort of change in `@JsonValue` annotation and in Serialization in 2.12 but I didn't see anything obvious that would cause this. The main reason I upgraded was to try the Blackbird module but found this as a side effect and wanted to find out if it was intended or expected. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
