I expect that \"{}\" will be parsed correctly to empty Map when I'm using `@JsonCreator`\n\nI've found that this case is invalid https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/jackson-databind-2.6.3/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/std/UntypedObjectDeserializer.java#L272, but why?\n\nHere is the minimum code to reproduce:\n\n```\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n        mapper.readValue(\"[]\", SomeObjectThatCanBeAggregated.class);\n        mapper.readValue(\"[{}]\", SomeObjectThatCanBeAggregated.class);\n        mapper.readValue(\"{\\\"key\\\":null}\", SomeObjectThatCanBeAggregated.class);\n        mapper.readValue(\"{}\", SomeObjectThatCanBeAggregated.class);\n    }\n}\nclass SomeObjectThatCanBeAggregated {\n\n    @JsonCreator\n    public SomeObjectThatCanBeAggregated(Object obj) {\n        System.out.println(obj + \" //\" + obj.getClass());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput: \n\n```\n[] //class java.util.ArrayList\n[{}] //class java.util.ArrayList\n{key=null} //class java.util.LinkedHashMap\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Can not deserialize instance of java.lang.Object out of END_OBJECT token\n at [Source: {}; line: 1, column: 2]\n...\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/989/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
