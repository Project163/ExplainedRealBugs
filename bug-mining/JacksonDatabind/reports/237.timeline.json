main motivation for this update is updating Guava from 20.0 to 27.0.1-jre. Between these versions, the implementation of `Maps.newConcurrentMap()` (this method is used in many places in Curator code) was changed and now it returns `ConcurrentHashMap` instead of Guava's own implementation, that was less efficient.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates Jackson version, as well as #280, from 2.7 to 2.9. Answering questions raised in the comments to that PR: I believe upgrading Jackson from 2.7 to 2.9 is safe. The compatibility standards in Jackson are much higher than in an average Java project. Most incompatibilities in [2.8](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.8#changes-compatibility) and [2.9](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9#changes-compatibility) are minor tweaks in Jackson's programmatic API (shouldn't be a concern as long as Curator is built and passes tests with the updated dependencies). Also support for some old Java and Android versions is dropped, shouldn't be a concern in Curator either. Finally, seems that there are the only two changes that affect serialization format: [of `java.nio.Path`](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1235) and [of `java.sql.Date`](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/219). It also doesn't seem to be relevant to Curator.\r\n\r\nTesting: `mvn test` in a private CI server passed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/477407283","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/219#issuecomment-477407283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/219","id":477407283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzQwNzI4Mw==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-28T01:24:01Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T01:24:01Z","body":"Would this be considered a breaking change or incompatibility migrating from jackson-databind 2.8 to 2.9?
