Search before asking\r\n\r\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nAfter #4481, I checked if we have anything else in `EnumDeserializer` that won't override.\r\n`READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE` config does not work also.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n2.17.0\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n(Copied from my PR)\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    enum Types {\r\n        @JsonEnumDefaultValue\r\n        DEFAULT_TYPE,\r\n        FAST, SLOW\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static class SpeedWithoutDefaultOverride {\r\n        @JsonFormat(without = JsonFormat.Feature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE)\r\n        public Types type;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static class SpeedWithDefaultOverride {\r\n        @JsonFormat(with = JsonFormat.Feature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE)\r\n        public Types type;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testJsonEnumDefaultValueOverrideOverGlobalConfig() throws Exception {\r\n        final String UNKNOWN_JSON = a2q(\"{'type':'OOPS!'}\");\r\n\r\n        // First, global configuration is ENABLED and JsonFeature configuration is DISABLED\r\n        // So the test should fail\r\n        try {\r\n            JsonMapper.builder()\r\n                .enable(DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE)\r\n                .build()\r\n                .readValue(UNKNOWN_JSON, SpeedWithoutDefaultOverride.class);\r\n            fail();\r\n        } catch (InvalidFormatException e) {\r\n            verifyException(e, \"Cannot deserialize value of type\");\r\n            verifyException(e, \"not one of the values accepted for Enum class\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Second, global configuration is DISABLED and JsonFeature configuration is ENABLED\r\n        // So the test should pass\r\n        SpeedWithDefaultOverride pojo = JsonMapper.builder()\r\n            .disable(DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE)\r\n            .build()\r\n            .readValue(UNKNOWN_JSON, SpeedWithDefaultOverride.class);\r\n\r\n        assertEquals(Types.DEFAULT_TYPE, pojo.type);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBe able to override `DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE` with `JsonFormat.Feature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE` \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nFiled a PR to fix

issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
