the bug**\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidTypeIdException: Could not resolve type id 'java.util.GregorianCalendar' as a subtype of `javax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar`: Not a subtype\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.12.0\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nAfter enabling default typing, any objects containing XMLGregorianCalendar fields will throw the above error when deserializing.\r\nThis is likely because Jackson internally converts XMLGregorianCalendar to java.util.GregorianCalendar automatically.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nDefault typing should work with XMLGregorianCalendar without having to override with any customized deserializer.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThere was a SO question describing the problem and a proposed workaround.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/49258540/jackson-polymorphic-serialization-generates-an-incorrect-class-name","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
