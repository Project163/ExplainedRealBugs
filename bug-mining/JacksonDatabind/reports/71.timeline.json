the bug**\r\nWith #312 sub type mapping to same class was fixed/ enabled for declaring `@JsonSubTypes`. As already mentioned in [a later comment](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/312#issuecomment-406244548) in that issue, the same does not work for specifying sub type mapping programmatically using `ObjectMapper.registerSubtypes(NamedType... types)`. Reason is that `equals(..)` and `hashCode(..)` of `NamedType` only do consider the class field, but not the name field. StdSubtypeResolver uses a LinkedHashSet to which only the first sub type is being added.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nWhich Jackson version(s) was this for?\r\n2.10.5\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```\r\nfinal ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n// this sub type is being added successfully\r\nobjectMapper.registerSubtypes(new NamedType(MyObject.class, \"myObject1\"));\r\n// this one is not being added\r\nobjectMapper.registerSubtypes(new NamedType(MyObject.class, \"myObject2\"));\r\n```\r\nWhile the same worked with `@JsonSubTypes`:\r\n```\r\n@JsonTypeInfo(\r\n        use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME,\r\n        include = JsonTypeInfo.As.EXTERNAL_PROPERTY,\r\n        property = \"type\",\r\n        defaultImpl = java.lang.Void.class)\r\n@JsonSubTypes({\r\n        @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = MyObject.class, name = \"myObject1\"),\r\n        @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = MyObject.class, name = \"myObject2\")\r\n})\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nObjectMapper should successfully register all sub types even if they map to same class.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nBackground for changing from declarative (annotations) to programmatic approach is a refactoring in a way that the generic (and so far annotated) class is being moved into a central lib and must no longer be aware of all the specific sub types.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"amseager","id":13808248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODA4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13808248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager","html_url":"https://github.com/amseager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amseager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-02T13:37:38Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T13:37:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4064","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4064/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4064/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4064/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4064","id":1833209765,"node_id":"I_kwDOAC5e2c5tRI-l","number":4064,"title":"Question:
