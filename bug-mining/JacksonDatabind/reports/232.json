This fails in a few different versions of Jackson for me. I'm not sure if I'm missing some sort of configuration somewhere or what, so I've included a gist reproducing the issue:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/brianv0/0dc42b7bd45b7a7b384e\n\nIn summary, what I get when serializing a BigDecimal, a java.lang.Integer, and a java.lang.String, where all classes have been annotated as subtypes of types decimal, integer, and string:\n\n```\n{\"$type\":\"MetadataView\",\"metadata\":\n   [{\"key\":\"hello_decimal\",\"value\":1234.4321,\"$type\":\"BigDecimal\"},\n   {\"key\":\"hello_integer\",\"value\":1234,\"$type\":\"integer\"},\n   {\"key\":\"hello_string\",\"value\":\"world\",\"$type\":\"string\"}]\n}\n```\n\nWhat I'd like:\n\n```\n{\"$type\":\"MetadataView\",\"metadata\":\n   [{\"key\":\"hello_decimal\",\"value\":1234.4321,\"$type\":\"decimal\"},\n   {\"key\":\"hello_integer\",\"value\":1234,\"$type\":\"integer\"},\n   {\"key\":\"hello_string\",\"value\":\"world\",\"$type\":\"string\"}]\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/466/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
