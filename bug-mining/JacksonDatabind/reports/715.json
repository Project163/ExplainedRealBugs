This is probably not what is wanted, at least for Records.\r\n\r\nSo, we have 2 possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. If `SORT_CREATOR_PROPERTIES_FIRST` is enabled, retain order of all Properties-based Creators (unless there is explicit `@JsonPropertyOrder`)\r\n2. Only retain full ordering for `Record` Creators\r\n\r\nFurther we could add a new `MapperFeature` to control above cases.\r\nSomething like `MapperFeature.RETAIN_ORDER_OF_CREATOR_PROPERTIES`?\r\n\r\nNOTE: this becomes more obvious with 3.0 when `SORT_PROPERTIES_ALPHABETICALLY` will be enabled by default.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4580/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
