Describe your Issue\r\n\r\n#4416 suggested deprecation of `JsonNode.asText(defaultValue)` because the default implementation of the method seemed to be useless according to its javadoc. But in my opinion, the javadoc didn't describe the behavior of the method accurately, which caused misunderstanding. It said: \r\n\r\n...  it will return `defaultValue` in cases where **null value would be returned**;\r\n\r\nWhat did \"null value would be returned\" mean? Judging from its default implemenation, it seemed that when `asText()` returned a null value, the default value would be returned instead.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the truth. I believe you have noticed that some classes have overwritten the method, for example the `NullNode` and the `MissingNode`. But their implementation did not follow the javadoc, which was more confusing.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the description \"null value would be returned\". Actually, it does not mean `asText()` would return a null value, but it means **the internal value of the node is null**. If we take this understanding, we could easily understand the overwritten behavior of `NullNode`, `MissingNode` and `POJONode`. The `NullNode` and `MissingNode` definitely contain null values, and the `POJONode` may contain a null value (by the way, there's a similar but rare case in `TextNode` if it is constructed from `null`). All of the 3 classes overwrite the method to follow the rule described above.\r\n\r\nNow we could understand the default implementation of the method. For a `TextNode`, there is a rare case that it may contain null values (`asText()` will return `null` in the case) and the implementation has covered the case. For other types of `JsonNode`, there should not be null values so the implementation actually forwards the method invocation to `asText()`.\r\n\r\nWe can see that the motivation of `asText(defaultValue)` is clear but the implementation is a bit tricky. But this is not enough to persuade us to keep the method. We should find cases in which `asText(defaultValue)` is useful. Consider the case when we try to process a list of json objects in which some keys may be missing or null. We would like to display the data of the json objects in a  table. If the corresponding column is missing or null, we will show a dash \"-\". With the help of `asText(defaultValue)`, we just need to write:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString toShow = theObj.path(\"the corresponding key\").asText(\"-\"); // Show a dash - for values not available\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the method:\r\n```java\r\nJsonNode theNode = theObj.path(\"the corresponding key\");\r\nString toShow;\r\nif (theNode.isNull() || theNode.isMissing()) {\r\n  toShow = \"-\";\r\n} else if (theNode.isPojo()) {\r\n  Object value = ((POJONode) theNode).getPojo();\r\n  if (value == null) {\r\n    toShow = \"-\";\r\n  } else {\r\n    toShow = value.toString();\r\n  }\r\n} else {\r\n  String value = theNode.asText();\r\n  // Rare cases. Usually we can directly use asText() but the code below makes our program more robust.\r\n  if (value == null) {\r\n    toShow = \"-\";\r\n  } else {\r\n    toShow = value;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see that `asText(defaultValue)` provides a convenient and natural way of string conversion with defaults for missing or null values. At the same time, it provides \"non-null\" guarantee for getting text values by a non-null default value, and \"null-if-not-available\" behavior by passing a default null value.\r\n\r\nFinally, I suggest keeping the method and clarifying its javadoc description. or deprecating the current name but renaming it to describe the behavior more
