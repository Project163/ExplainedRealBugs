Please describe.\n\nIn Jackson 3, for some reasons, only `createNonBlockingByteArrayParser` exists in ObjectMapper. Spring also uses `createNonBlockingByteBufferParser` in its `JacksonTokenizer` and currently has to write code like:\n```java\nDeserializationContextExt context = objectMapper._deserializationContext();\nJsonParser parser = context.assignAndReturnParser(objectMapper.tokenStreamFactory().createNonBlockingByteBufferParser(context));\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be better to have `ObjectMapper#createNonBlockingByteBufferParser` to avoid invoking `objectMapper._deserializationContext()` in production code and have a shorter syntax.\n\n### Usage example\n\n```java\nJsonParser parser = objectMapper.createNonBlockingByteBufferParser();\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
