the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen trying to deserialise an empty JSON string as `java.util.Locale`, the resulting value is `NULL`, when ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT is set to `true`.\r\nMy expectation was that the empty string would be converted to `Locale.ROOT`.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.13.5\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nThe following test fails:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass JsonDeserializationTest\r\n{\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testDeserializeRootLocale() throws JsonProcessingException\r\n    {\r\n        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n        objectMapper.configure(DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT, true);\r\n\r\n        assertEquals(Locale.ROOT, objectMapper.readValue(\"\\\"\\\"\", Locale.class));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the current source code at https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.16/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/cfg/CoercionConfigs.java#L241\r\nIt looks like `CoercionAction.TryConvert` should be returned in this case.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
