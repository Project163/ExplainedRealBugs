The main reason has been mutability of `ObjectMapper` which has meant that it'd effectively be a stateful global singleton, prone to cause problems when one library re-configures it.\r\n\r\nBut with Jackson 3.0 we finally get truly immutable mappers. Given this, there is no reason why we could not offer simple, efficient and intuitive way for \"stock vanilla instance\", useful for things like:\r\n\r\n1. Reading of `Map`s, `JsonNode`s\r\n2. Writing of most types, without customization (or, via `ObjectWriter`, even with minor tweaks)\r\n3. Use from static and otherwise limited context (`toString()` implementation)\r\n\r\nSo, let's do it.\r\n\r\nAfter some thought, name `shared()` seems appropriate over alternatives considered (`default()` is not possible due to Java 8 making it keyword; `vanilla()` may not be intuitive; `instance()` implies creation of something new).\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
