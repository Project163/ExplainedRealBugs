The data is fetched from an api that can add further possible enum values at any point. I want to guard my implementation by using the JsonEnumDefaultValue.\r\n\r\nDuring the deserialization of an unknown value, instead of the annotated default, a different instance of this enum is returned.\n\n### Version Information\n\n2.16\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/dominik-henning/jackson-databind-enum-deserialization-reproducer\r\n\r\ni created a projected containing a test class which shows my usecase and setup.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen an value is encountered which does not match to a annotated JsonProperty, i would expect that the JsonEnumDefaultValue is returned.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe real world example is different, but the project boils the problem down to the bare minimum.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
