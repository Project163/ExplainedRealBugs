Details can be found at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/18077\n\nCan the ignoring of CGLIB be restored? If not, what is the reason and what is the recommended way that users should restore this behavior in Jackson 3?\n\n### Version Information\n\ntools.jackson.core:jackson-databind-3.0.0\n\n### Reproduction\n\nA complete example of the `callbacks` property not being rendered [in Jackson 2](https://github.com/rwinch/spring-sample/blob/jackson-cglib-properties/src/jackson2/java/jackson2/CglibTest.java#L16) and [rendering callbacks property in Jackson 3](https://github.com/rwinch/spring-sample/blob/jackson-cglib-properties/src/jackson3/java/jackson3/CglibTest.java) can be found at https://github.com/rwinch/spring-sample/tree/jackson-cglib-properties You can run `./gradlew check` to perform checks for both Jackson 2 and Jackson 3 or `./gradlew jackson2` and `./gradlew jackson3` to run the tests separately.\n\n\n```java\nstatic class Person {\n\tprivate final String firstName;\n\n\tprivate final String lastName;\n\n\tpublic Person(String firstName, String lastName) {\n\t\tthis.firstName = firstName;\n\t\tthis.lastName = lastName;\n\t}\n\n\tpublic String getFirstName() {\n\t\treturn firstName;\n\t}\n\n\tpublic String getLastName() {\n\t\treturn lastName;\n\t}\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void cglibPropertiesNotRendered() throws Exception {\n\tJsonMapper mapper = JsonMapper.builder().build();\n\tPerson target = new Person(\"first\", \"last\");\n\tProxyFactory factory = new ProxyFactory(target); // ProxyFactory from org.springframework:spring-aop:7.0.0-RC1\n\tfactory.setOpaque(true);\n\n\tPerson proxied = (Person) factory.getProxy();\n\tString json = mapper.writeValueAsString(proxied);\n\tMap<String, Object> properties = mapper.readValue(json, new TypeReference<>() {\n\t});\n\tassertThat(properties).containsOnlyKeys(\"firstName\", \"lastName\"); // fails because callbacks property is included\n}\n``` \n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'd expect that Jackson 3 does not render CGLIB proxy properties.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5354/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
