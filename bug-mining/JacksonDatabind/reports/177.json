I was able to create a simple test case that seems very similiar to the examples given in the comments of SimpleAbstractTypeResolver, yet it doesn't work:\n\n``` java\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.module.SimpleModule;\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;\nimport static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;\n\npublic class AbstractTypeMappingGenericsProblemTest {\n\n    public interface IContainer<T> {\n        @JsonProperty(\"ts\")\n        List<T> getTs();\n    }\n\n    public static class MyContainer<T> implements IContainer<T> {\n\n        final List<T> ts;\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        public MyContainer(@JsonProperty(\"ts\") List<T> ts) {\n            this.ts = ts;\n        }\n\n        public List<T> getTs() {\n            return ts;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static class MyObject {\n        @JsonProperty(\"msg\")\n        String msg;\n    }\n\n\n    @Test\n    public void testDeserializeMyContainer() throws IOException {\n        Module module = new SimpleModule().addAbstractTypeMapping(IContainer.class, MyContainer.class);\n        final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper().registerModule(module);\n        String json = \"{\\\"ts\\\": [ { \\\"msg\\\": \\\"hello\\\"} ] }\";\n        final Object o = mapper.readValue(json, mapper.getTypeFactory().constructParametricType(IContainer.class, MyObject.class));\n        assertThat(o, instanceOf(MyContainer.class));\n        assertThat(o, hasProperty(\"ts\", contains(instanceOf(MyObject.class))));\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nI am able to make the test case work using a custom implementation of AbstractTypeResolver that directly resolves to a parameterized type:\n\n``` java\n        Module module = new Module() {\n\n            // ....\n\n            @Override\n            public void setupModule(SetupContext context) {\n                context.addAbstractTypeResolver(new AbstractTypeResolver() {\n                    @Override\n                    public JavaType findTypeMapping(DeserializationConfig config, JavaType type) {\n                        //  Just a simple stub implementation\n                        if (type.getRawClass().equals(IContainer.class)) {\n                            return config.getTypeFactory().constructParametricType(MyContainer.class, MyObject.class);\n                        }\n                        return super.findTypeMapping(config, type);\n                    }\n                });\n            }\n        };\n```\n\nSo is this a bug or does SimpleAbstractTypeResolver just not really support generics? Or did I misunderstand something here? Is implementing a custom AbstractTypeResolver the way to go?\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
