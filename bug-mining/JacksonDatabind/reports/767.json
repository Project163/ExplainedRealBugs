The equivalent `DeserializationContext` functions do not. I would expect the two functions to behave similarly, or the differences should be documented.\n\nSee below for a reproducer and use case.\n\n### Version Information\n\n2.18.1\n\n### Reproduction\n\nMy use case is that I have a custom deserializer that reads the `defaultValue` metadata field that is populated by the `JsonProperty` annotation. I implement a custom `getAbsentValue` function that will handle the default values. However, I also want to allow `\"null\"` as a default value.\n\n```kotlin\noverride fun getAbsentValue(ctxt: DeserializationContext): Property<*> {\n    val defaultString = property?.metadata?.defaultValue // This is the string \"null\"\n\n    if(defaultString != null) {\n        val tree = ctxt.parser.codec.factory.createParser(defaultString).readValueAsTree<JsonNode>()\n        val thisWorks = (ctxt.parser.codec as ObjectMapper).treeToValue<Any>(tree, valueType)\n        val doesNotWork = ctxt.readTreeAsValue<Any>(tree, valueType)\n\n        // Further handling\n}\n```\n\nThe workaround is to cast the codec to an `ObjectMapper`, but that does not seem very nice and I would prefer not to do it, since there are no guarantees of the cast being allowed.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4934/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
