So, all remaining 11 failures are actually weird, but due to same underlying issue: use of External Type Id leading to:\n\n```\nUnexpected close marker '}': expected ']'\n```\n\nfailures. This must be due to the way `JsonTypeInfo.Include.EXTERNAL_PROPERTY` is internally handled and not due to actual parsing.\n\nThis suggests problem unrelated to `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_TRAILING_TOKENS`, actually, which is good. But unfortunately I am at loss as to how to actually resolve it at this point.\nSo without somehow resolving this issue, change to defaults cannot proceed because:\n\n1. Unit test must pass, and in this case changing defaults is wrong (hiding true problem). But more importantly...\n2. ... some users would probably hit this problem with default change (otherwise they would only do so if explicitly enabling feature).\n\nSo will need to put this on hold for now, probably.
