I use the annotation @JsonUnwrapped to materialize a component bean, the scale of the BigDecimal deserialized is different. I've written a test case below to reproduce the issue.\nIs there a way to control the scale of BigDecimal? Do I have to configure a custom deserializer?\n\n(Test case reproduced with Jacskon 2.4.0 and 1.9.13 on Java 6)\n\nThanks,\n\nBenoit\n\n``` java\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonUnwrapped;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport org.junit.Assert;\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\nimport java.math.BigDecimal;\n\npublic class BigDecimalScaleTest {\n\n    private String json = \"{\" +\n            \"  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Ben\\\",\" +\n            \"  \\\"first\\\": 12.00,\" +\n            \"  \\\"second\\\": 14.00\" +\n            \"}\";\n\n    private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n\n    @Test\n    public void testScale() throws Exception {\n\n        MyDomain myDomain = objectMapper.readValue(json, MyDomain.class);\n\n        MyFlatDomain myFlatDomain = objectMapper.readValue(json, MyFlatDomain.class);\n\n        Assert.assertEquals(myDomain.getName(), myFlatDomain.getName());\n        Assert.assertEquals(myDomain.getFirst(), myFlatDomain.getFirst()); // 12.00 = 12.00\n        Assert.assertEquals(myDomain.getInnerDomain().getSecond(), myFlatDomain.getSecond());\n         // 14.0 != 14.00\n    }\n\n    private static class MyDomain {\n        private String name;\n        private BigDecimal first;\n        @JsonUnwrapped\n        private MyInnerDomain innerDomain;\n\n        public String getName() {\n            return name;\n        }\n\n        public void setName(String name) {\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n\n        public BigDecimal getFirst() {\n            return first;\n        }\n\n        public void setFirst(BigDecimal first) {\n            this.first = first;\n        }\n\n        public MyInnerDomain getInnerDomain() {\n            return innerDomain;\n        }\n\n        public void setInnerDomain(MyInnerDomain innerDomain) {\n            this.innerDomain = innerDomain;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static class MyInnerDomain {\n        private BigDecimal second;\n\n        public BigDecimal getSecond() {\n            return second;\n        }\n\n        public void setSecond(BigDecimal second) {\n            this.second = second;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static class MyFlatDomain {\n        private String name;\n        private BigDecimal first;\n        private BigDecimal second;\n\n        public String getName() {\n            return name;\n        }\n\n        public void setName(String name) {\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n\n        public BigDecimal getFirst() {\n            return first;\n        }\n\n        public void setFirst(BigDecimal first) {\n            this.first = first;\n        }\n\n        public BigDecimal getSecond() {\n            return second;\n        }\n\n        public void setSecond(BigDecimal second) {\n            this.second = second;\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/632/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
