If I understand description correctly, yes, creator method should be detected for deserialization purposes. But handling of Creator methods is not done by `POJOPropertiesCollector` (for historical reasons), so it does not have (nor, I think, should have) logic to deal with Creators. At least for Jackson 2.x: for 3.0 I hope we can and will fully rewrite the logic as this division is problematic.\r\n\r\nGiven this, I think that:\r\n\r\n1. From above definition, `ObjectMapper` should be able to deserialize things using Builder-style pattern here. If not, a test showing failure would be useful\r\n2.
