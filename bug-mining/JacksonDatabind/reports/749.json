no `java.util.stream.Stream` producing methods in `JsonNode`. But it should be straight-forward at methods as follows:\r\n\r\n1. `Stream<JsonNode> JsonNode.valueStream()`: for `ArrayNode` return `Stream` of all element `JsonNode`s; for `ObjectNode` return `Stream` of all values of child entries; for other nodes empty `Stream`\r\n2. `Stream<Map.Entry> JsonNode.propertyStream()`: for `ObjectNode` return `Stream` of all properties (name, value pairs); for other nodes empty `Stream`\r\n3. `void JsonNode.forEachEntry(BiConsumer<String, JsonNode>)`: for `ObjectNode` calls consumer with all entries; for other nodes does nothing.\r\n\r\nIn future we could also consider some of:\r\n\r\n- \"parallel\" stream variants (for `valueStream()`, `propertyStream()`)\r\n- \"spliterator\" for value/property streams\r\n\r\nBut let's start with the simplest cases first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
