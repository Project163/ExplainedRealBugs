Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nSerialising and deserialising an object that has a List field with two getters returning the field, results in the list elements being duplicated after a serialisation and deserialisation process. If there was one item in the myIds field of the class initially, on serialisation and deserialisation the myIds list contains two duplicated elements in the newly deserialised object. The duplication is exponential on subsequent serialisations and deserialisations.\n\nThis simplified example is a little contrived. Just for a bit of context, in the real scenario we experienced this issue the class that was being serialised/deserialised extended an abstract class which defined a getter method that needed to be overridden by the child classes. The extending class had @Data Lombok annotation to add getters and setters for all fields in the class. The overridden getter had a common name (not tied to the field name) as it returned different fields based on the type of the extending class. That is how there ended up being two getters returning the same property.\n\nThe list element duplication ended up leading to very high memory usage in the service, one object taking up pretty much all the heap space. This was a result of a number of serialisation and deserialisations of the same object. This happened due to the object being read from a cache and moved between different cache tiers (heap to offheap etc) as usage dictated. Note, we have since resolved the issue by adding @JsonIgnore on the overridden getter.\n\n### Version Information\n\n2.18.3\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThe ids field on MyObject initially has [\"1234\"] when deserialised. On subsequent serialisation and subsequent deserialisation, it has [\"1234\", \"1234\"]. Below is a view of what the objects contain during the test, showing the duplicated elements in obj2.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e184655a-5ebd-4bfc-b6bc-ef57ca6c602f)\n\n```java\npackage com.test;\n\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;\nimport org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\n\n@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)\npublic class TestSerialisation {\n\n    static class MyObject {\n\n        public MyObject() {\n\n        }\n        private List<String> ids = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        public List<String> getIds() {\n            return ids;\n        }\n\n        public List<String> getMyIds() {\n            return ids;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testDuplicatedListElementsOnSerializationAndDeserialization() throws IOException {\n        String json = \"\"\"\n                { \"ids\": [\"1234\"] }\n                \"\"\";\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n\n        // First deserialisation to a MyObject instance\n        MyObject obj = mapper.readValue(json, MyObject.class);\n\n        // First serialisation of the MyObject\n        String serialisedObject = mapper.writeValueAsString(obj);\n\n        // Second deserialisation of the serialised string to a new MyObject instance.
