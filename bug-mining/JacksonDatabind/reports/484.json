takes an array of `NamedType`s:\r\n```java\r\n    @Override    \r\n    public void registerSubtypes(NamedType... types) {\r\n        if (_registeredSubtypes == null) {\r\n            _registeredSubtypes = new LinkedHashSet<NamedType>();\r\n        }\r\n        for (NamedType type : types) {\r\n            _registeredSubtypes.add(type);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nBut unfortunately, if I want to register the same POJO for several types (let's say the JSONs only differ on their type field), it will only register the first one because they are added to a `LinkedHashSet` and NamedType doesn't include `name` field in `equals`/`hashcode`.\r\n\r\nI don't even create a subtype of NamedType to override `equals`/`hashcode` because the class it final.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to care about `NamedType.name` field ?","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
