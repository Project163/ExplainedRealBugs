It is possible to specify format (via `@JsonFormat(pattern=...)`, global defaults), which users probably have to do, but I can not think of other easy setting to use. Use of `SerializationFeature` would be a possibility although it'd seem unfortunate to add a datatype-specific feature in general set (it has been done often before, but seems wrong nonetheless). And then we have the practical problem that API should not be extended in patch release, which would suggest any feature added would have to wait until 3.0.\r\nSo, bit of a problem

thanks for the explanation. Originally I was using @JsonFormat with the pattern \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ\" for a ZonedDateTime and that serialized the timezone with no colon. That was not a problem until I tested against Safari so I had to change it.\r\n\r\nI understood that \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX\" should serialize the timezone with the colon but the JSON produced has Z instead of the 4 numbers with the colon. I also understood that \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZZ\" should serialize the timezone with the colon but that serializes it without the colon.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't know if that's a bug and if it's jackson's, or if I'm using the wrong patterns. If it is indeed a bug, I'd be happy to file it.\r\n\r\nPS: I do not use Joda at
