}\n}\n\npublic interface Person extends Contact {}\n\npublic class PersonImpl extends ContactImpl implements Person {}\n\npublic class PersonMixin extends ContactMixin implements Person {}\n```\n\nand I configure a module as\n\n``` java\n// There are other getters/properties in the Impl class that do not need to be serialized and so\n// I am using the Mixin to match the interface and explicitly annotate all the inherited methods\nmodule.disable(MapperFeature.ALLOW_FINAL_FIELDS_AS_MUTATORS)\n    .disable(MapperFeature.AUTO_DETECT_FIELDS)\n    .disable(MapperFeature.AUTO_DETECT_GETTERS)\n    .disable(MapperFeature.AUTO_DETECT_IS_GETTERS)\n    .disable(MapperFeature.INFER_PROPERTY_MUTATORS);\nmodule.setMixInAnnotation(Person.class, PersonMixin.class);\n```\n\nWhen a `PersonImpl` instance is serialized, `city` is not included.\n\nI debugged the code and this is what happens:\nIn `AnnotatedClass.resolveMemberMethods()` the supertypes of `PersonImpl` are `[Person.class, Contact.class, ContactImpl.class]` in that order.\n\nIt starts with `Person` for which it finds `PersonMixin` and proceeds to `AnnotatedClass._addMethodMixIns()`. Here the `parents` list has `[PersonMixin, ContactMixin, Contact]`. When it processes `ContactMixin` it adds `getCity()` with the `JsonProperty` annotation. Then it processes `Contact`, doesn't find `getCity()` in `methods` map and so creates a new `AnnotatedMethod` for `getCity()` with the one from the interface which has no annotation which replaces the one from `ContactMixin`\n\nThe workaround for this issue is to explicitly add any parent mixins to the module i.e.\n\n``` java\nmodule.setMixInAnnotation(Contact.class, ContactMixin.class);\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
