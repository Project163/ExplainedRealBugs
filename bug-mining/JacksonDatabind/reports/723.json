Please describe.\r\n\r\nRelates to and described in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/805, to help better reduce maintenance points on module side.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nProvide extension point for modules (esp. per language, like jackson-module-kotlin) to indicate primary Creator (usually properties-based constructor) to use if no annotations used: this is typically referred to as \"Canonical\" creator. Concept also exists in Java, for Record types.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious approach would be to add a new method (or methods) in `AnnotationIntrospector` as this is an existing extensible mechanism already used by language modules.\r\n\r\n### Usage example\r\n\r\nUsage to be discussed.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nSee #4515 for work that enabled possibility to detect Canonical creator (for Java Records).\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit the title and all @cowtowncoder ","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
