This requires endless littering of boilerplate casts and conversions throughout code, for example:\n\n``` java\nMap<String, Object> map = mapper.readValue(payload, Map.class);\n//long value = (Long)map.get(\"key\");  // throws class cast exception\nlong value = ((Number)map.get(\"key\")).longValue;  // gack\n```\n\nIt would be fantastic if Jackson had an option to force all untyped numbers to Long instead of Integer. I propose DeserializationFeature.USE_LONG_FOR_INTS to be consistent with other features.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/504/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":8,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
