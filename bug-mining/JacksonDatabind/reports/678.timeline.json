In HTTP, a response with a status code of 204 (No Content) indicates that the request was successful, but there is no content to return in the response body. Since there is no response body, there won't be an HTTP entity associated with the response and hence response.getEntity() returns IllegalArgumentException(HTTP Response entity doesn't exist) when the HTTP response code is 204 when the ingestionReportMethod is set to TABLE.

Search before asking\n\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nAfter upgrading to latest version of jackson i.e. 2.15.0-rc1, serialization of X509Certificate is failing with error whereas same is working with 2.13.5\r\n\r\nGetting following error:\r\n\r\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: No serializer found for class sun.security.util.ObjectIdentifier and no properties discovered to create BeanSerializer (to avoid exception, disable SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS) (through reference chain: CertChainValidation[\"chain\"]->java.util.ArrayList[0]->CertificateChain[\"certificate\"]->sun.security.x509.X509CertImpl[\"publicKey\"]->sun.security.rsa.RSAPublicKeyImpl[\"algorithmId\"]->sun.security.x509.AlgorithmId[\"oid\"])\r\n\r\nWe are getting following error from our internal application:\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: No serializer found for class java.util.Vector$1 and no properties

know we can fix by disabling the SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS but we want to retain the old behavior. Any pointer on retaining the old behavior will be appreciated. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Version Information\n\n2.15.0-rc1\n\n### Reproduction\n\n<-- Any of the following\r\n1.
