Ok now it all makes sense. Series of unfortunate events, unintended side effects. So it's due to 2 things:\r\n\r\n1. Use of `Class<?>`es from wherever (annotation types) as keys AND\r\n2. Static reference to default introspector instance\r\n\r\nAlthough (2) might be initially easier, I think (1) might actually make more sense: without resolving that there would still be possibility of retention via non-static references. Use of arbitrary Class instances as keys tends to lead to hard to track down retention.\r\n\r\nA simple way that I'll probably is to use `String` of class name as the key. There's theoretical concern of same class via different class loaders, but I'd think these should refer to same definition (at leas wrt existence of `@JacksonAnnotationsInside`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately fix needs to go in 2.15.0, I think, just due to risk involved (no API change needed).\r\nBut I think it's otherwise fairly straight-forward; will tackle this today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1418199367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1418240092","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3771#issuecomment-1418240092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3771","id":1418240092,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c5UiKBc","user":{"login":"pjfanning","id":11783444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgzNDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11783444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning","html_url":"https://github.com/pjfanning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-05T19:04:00Z","updated_at":"2023-02-05T19:04:00Z","body":"@cowtowncoder there is com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.ClassKey which seems to have been written for this purpose.

to #3771 )\r\n\r\nCurrently there is a problem in static singleton instance of `JacksonAnnotationIntrospector`: due to caching used for `_annotationsInside`, instances are stateful; a big no-no for static singletons. It has caused class retention, as per #3771, but even if that gets resolved this is not good design.\r\nBut beyond static singleton instance there's related `BaseSettings` default which should not be static singleton either.\r\n\r\nWe have couple of options here:\r\n\r\n1. Change instance to be per-mapper, constructed eagerly; also need to change `BaseSettings` similarly. Some increased memory usage per-mapper but should not be too drastic\r\n2. Just remove `_annotationsInside` cache -- as per comments, it is highly speculative and might not provide that much performance benefits for typical non-badly-written use
