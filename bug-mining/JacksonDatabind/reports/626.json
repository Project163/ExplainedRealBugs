                 // is the string \"test\"\r\nStringBuffer b = mapper.readValue(json, StringBuffer.class); // throws Exception\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot construct instance of `java.lang.StringBuffer` (although at least one Creator exists): no String-argument constructor/factory method to deserialize from String value ('test')\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\njava.lang.String, java.lang.StringBuilder, java.lang.StringBuffer can be serialized and deserialized.\r\n\r\n**EDIT** (by @cowtowncoder )\r\n\r\nRegression affects versions 2.12.x and 2.13.0 - 2.13.2;
