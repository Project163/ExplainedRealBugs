is a work in progress.\r\n\r\nBehavior changed upstream in Jackson 2.9's MapSerializer to pass entire\r\nmap object to the filter instead of the entry.getValue() for the\r\nspecific entry.getKey() being filtered. This means that the object\r\nreceived by the filter is of an unexpected Map type instead of the\r\nCollection (in the JsonOutputFilter, the value is a Collection, because\r\nit's the set of values coming from a Multimap).\r\n\r\nThis change occurred to address FasterXML/jackson-databind#1655 and\r\noccurred in commit a2c667b9b8482581e64bb8752963984efb1214b5\r\n(https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/a2c667b9b8482581e64bb8752963984efb1214b5)\r\n\r\nAnother change seems to have affected the filtered output. The output\r\nthat is emitted is not the filtered output, but the unfiltered output,\r\nas if the filter is running, but its output does not affect\r\nserialization.\r\n\r\nThis is a very strange and buggy result.\r\n\r\nEarlier versions of Jackson databind are affected by numerous CVEs, but\r\nI'm not sure how to work around this (possibly broken) behavior change\r\nin order to upgrade to 2.9.9\r\n\r\nThis commit demonstrates a partial workaround, fixing the type change...\r\nbut I have not yet figured out how to fix the second issue to have the\r\nfilter affect the serialized output properly, and this is demonstrated\r\nby a test case which continues to fail.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
