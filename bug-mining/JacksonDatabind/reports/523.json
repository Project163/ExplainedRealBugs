It should be at least protected, like is the case of `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.util.EnumResolver` used by `EnumDeserializer`.\r\n\r\nI try to implement different strategy for serialization and deserialization of enums, simply to convert java SNAKE_CASE to more common in JSON camelCase and vice-versa. It is quite easy with `EnumDeserializer`, but in case of `EnumSerializer` it is not. I would like to just create new instance of `EnumSerializer` with `EnumValues` instance build using different logic. Currently the only way (without reflection which I will use for the time being) is to cal the `EnumValues#construct*` methods, which have hard-coded enum-to-string mapping logic.\r\n\r\nBTW. Consider adding casing strategy for enum serialization/deserialization as build-in jackson feature. For example in JSON.NET it is just a matter of passing approprate [NamingStrategy](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_Serialization_NamingStrategy.htm) to [StringEnumConverter](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/M_Newtonsoft_Json_Converters_StringEnumConverter__ctor_1.htm) constructor.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
