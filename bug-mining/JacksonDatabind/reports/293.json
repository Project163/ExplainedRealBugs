It appears the parser removes the trailing `Z` when found and construct a new `java.util.Date` instance using the timezone of the mapper instead of forcing it to UTC.\r\n\r\nThe example below illustrates the problem. It parses the representation of EPOCH in _zulu_ format once with the mapper in its default configuration and a second time with its timezone set to GMT+1.\r\nBecause the trailing `Z` should be considered as a UTC timezone indicator, both cases should lead to the same date which is not the case.\r\n\r\n```\r\nString json = \"\\\"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\\\"\";\r\n\r\n// Standard mapper with timezone UTC\r\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\nDate dateUTC = mapper.readValue(json, Date.class);  // 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000+00:00\r\n\r\n// Mapper with timezone GMT+1\r\nmapper.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"GMT+1\"));\r\nDate dateGMT1 = mapper.readValue(json, Date.class);  // 1969-12-31T23:00:00.000+00:00\r\n\r\n// Both dates should be the same\r\nAssert.assertEquals(dateUTC.getTime(), dateGMT1.getTime());  // FAIL\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1651/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
