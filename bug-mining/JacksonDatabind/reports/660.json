the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\nSimilar to #3093, in JBoss `JacksonAnnotationIntrospector._annotationsInside`, referenced statically via `ObjectMapper.DEFAULT_ANNOTATION_INTROSPECTOR`, might contain references to annotations from Deployment Class-Loaders, which leads to leaking those when the deployment is stopped/undeployed.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nWhich Jackson version(s) was this for?\r\n\r\n2.13.4.2, but from the code it looks like it's still true today.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/de62c677b12c02967c9620a11c1c5208f701cfef/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.java#L375\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/de62c677b12c02967c9620a11c1c5208f701cfef/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/introspect/JacksonAnnotationIntrospector.java#L82\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/de62c677b12c02967c9620a11c1c5208f701cfef/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/introspect/JacksonAnnotationIntrospector.java#L162\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ciis0/jackson-3771\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf reproduction itself needs further explanation, you may also add more details here.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n\r\nReference to annotation class from deployment class-loader in `JacksonAnnotationIntrospector `instance:
