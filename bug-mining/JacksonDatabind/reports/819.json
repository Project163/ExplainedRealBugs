Search before asking\n\n- [ ] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf `@JsonIdentityInfo` is used with records, an exception is thrown at deserialization.\n\n### Version Information\n\n2.19.2\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThis works perfectly:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIdentityInfo;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.ObjectIdGenerators;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n\npublic class JacksonTester {\n    public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n        Thing thing1 = new Thing(1, \"name1\");\n        Thing thing3 = new Thing(3, \"name3\");\n        Example example = new Example(List.of(thing1, thing3), thing3);\n\n        String jsonString = mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(example);\n        System.out.println(jsonString);\n        Example exampleD = mapper.readValue(jsonString, Example.class);\n        System.out.println(exampleD);\n    }\n}\n\nrecord Example(List<Thing> allThings, Thing selected) {}\n\n@JsonIdentityInfo(generator = ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator.class, property = \"id\")\n// record Thing(int id, String name) { }\nclass Thing {\n    public final int id;\n    public final String name;\n\n    @JsonCreator\n    Thing(@JsonProperty(\"id\") int id, @JsonProperty(\"name\") String name) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Thing [id=\" + id + \", name=\" + name + \"]\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf, however, I replace `class Thing {...}`  with `record Thing(int id, String name) { }`, an exception is thrown when the json is deserialized:\n\n> Exception in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: No fallback setter/field defined for creator property 'id' (of `Thing`) (through reference chain: Example[\"allThings\"]->java.util.ArrayList[0])\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nEither no exception when using records or a more informative error message if records cannot be supported for whatever reason.\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3307 - marked with try-with-later-jackson.\n\n(I tried with the last available version.)","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
