note: this issue seems to combine serialization and deserialization aspects: I understand that from end user perspective these are related; but from implementation perspective we need to try to separate them.\n\nSo it'd be good to limit this issue into one, or split into 2 issues (keeping this for one side, create another for the other side).\n\nFor example, @JooHyukKim 's comment mentions `@JsonInclude` which only affects serialization (which `Optional` valued properties are included in serialized JSON -- but then refers to `OptionalDeserializer` which is part of deserialization. Two are not directly related: and specifically `getAbsentValue()` has slightly different meaning for serialization and deserialization (in ser, it's whether Java value marks \"absent\" value; only relevant for `Optional` (and similar Ref types); in deser, it means \"absence [missing] from (incoming) JSON content\".\n\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/3375093853/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20131325851,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAC5e2c7P2Lt_zwAAAASv66eb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/20131325851","actor":{"login":"JooHyukKim","id":61615301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNjE1MzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61615301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim","html_url":"https://github.com/JooHyukKim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-07T03:51:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20131325860,"node_id":"SE_lADOAC5e2c7P2Lt_zwAAAASv66ek","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/20131325860","actor":{"login":"JooHyukKim","id":61615301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNjE1MzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61615301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim","html_url":"https://github.com/JooHyukKim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooHyukKim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-07T03:51:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/3375594956","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5335#issuecomment-3375594956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5335","id":3375594956,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c7JM33M","user":{"login":"wendigo","id":66972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo","html_url":"https://github.com/wendigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wendigo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admi
