This would happen when for example custom deserializer was wrapping standard one, created via `BeanDeserializerModifier`: both `resolve()` (via `ResolvableDeserializer`) and `createContextual` (via `ContextualDeserializer`) should be propagated as they are the mechanism to resolve cyclic type dependencies (resolve) and access to contextual information (annotations).\r\n\r\nAnother possibility wrt custom deserializers could be if `BeanDeserializer` was sub-classes: while this is not encouraged (sub-classing here is fragile, but can not be prevented) it is sometimes done as work-around.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/305891522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1108389326,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTEwODM4OTMyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1108389326","actor":{"login":"Johny-Kandhari","id":29130461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTMwNDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29130461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari","html_url":"https://github.com/Johny-Kandhari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-02T19:44:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1108389327,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExMDgzODkzMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1108389327","actor":{"login":"Johny-Kandhari","id":29130461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTMwNDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29130461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari","html_url":"https://github.com/Johny-Kandhari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-02T19:44:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/305894630","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1638#issuecomment-305894630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1638","id":305894630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTg5NDYzMA==","user":{"login":"Johny-Kandhari","id":29130461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTMwNDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29130461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari","html_url":"https://github.com/Johny-Kandhari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johny-Kandhari

\r\n\r\nNow I have the root cause for this issue. In Jackson 2.8.8 (MapperFeature.ACCEPT_CASE_INSENSITIVE_PROPERTIES,true) is not working. When i kept this feature disabled by default then the scenario is working fine.\r\n\r\nActually in the above scenario one of the bean is having wrong setter method Name. In SFTPConnectionBean the setter for field password is named as setPassWord instead of setPassword.\r\n\r\nThis is a typo error in the bean, bull till jackson 2.5.2 this feature (MapperFeature.ACCEPT_CASE_INSENSITIVE_PROPERTIES,true) was allowing this bean to deserialize \r\n\r\nBut in jackson 2.8.8 this is not working. when i commented this feature then the functionality was working fine and the bean was deserialized.\r\n\r\nIs is like that it is not reccomended to use this feature after 2.8.0? If it is recommended then why it is failing and if there is some another alternative to this in jackson 2.8.8.?\r\n\r\nPlease answer my queries so that i can get down to suitable conclusion.

sounds like there could be a remaining problem with that feature then. It should not throw an NPE. There have been some issues with this feature, but as far as I know all known issues before this one have been fixed.\r\n\r\nI have not had time to work on this issue, and probably will not for next couple of days. I hope to look into it relatively soon, still, as it sounds legitimate problem, even if as of yet not reported by anyone else.\r\n\r\nNow.... I think you may have misunderstood how open source software works: there are many, MANY users with all kinds of problems -- our projects have literally hundreds of open, reported issues -- and volunteers like me try to help these get resolved. Quite often I work on things on first-come, first-served basis. Others may work the same way, helping in areas they are most familiar with, or on issues they have also experienced. Sometimes more widely relevant issues get worked on earlier, sometimes not.\r\n\r\nBut one sure-fire way to get people pissed is to demand immediate focus for problem that you happen to have; somehow assuming that your need should somehow trump needs of everyone else. I suggest you avoid making that mistake.\r\n\r\nI will also not be giving hourly updates -- when I work on an issue, I add updates. Lack of updates is typically an indication of nothing of interest happening. It is fine to occasionally ask since things may fall through the cracks, but as I wrote, what seems like a demand is unlikely to result in additional helpful interaction.\r\n\r\nThank you for providing a test case; that should be helpful in isolating the
