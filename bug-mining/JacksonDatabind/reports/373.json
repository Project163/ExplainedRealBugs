multiple modules are used to map abstract types, deserialization might fail in 2.9+:\r\n\r\n> com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: Cannot construct instance of `model.Datatype1` (no Creators, like default construct, exist): abstract types either need to be mapped to concrete types, have custom deserializer, or contain additional type information\r\n\r\nThe bug can be reproduced for version 2.9+ in the attached maven project.\r\n\r\nI guess the bug was introduced due to a modification of _mapAbstractType2 in com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BasicDeserializerFactory:\r\n\r\n2.9:\r\nJavaType concrete = resolver.findTypeMapping(config, type);\r\nif (ClassUtil.rawClass(concrete) != currClass) {\r\n    return concrete;\r\n}\r\n\r\n2.8\r\nif (concrete != null && concrete.getRawClass() != currClass) {\r\n    return concrete;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe not null check is needed for continuing iterating other modules for abstract type mappings. \r\n\r\n[jackson-error-example.zip](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/1964903/jackson-error-example.zip)\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nAsger
