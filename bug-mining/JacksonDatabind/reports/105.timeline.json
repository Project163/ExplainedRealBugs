your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nNot a problem, as there is a relatively clear and simple way to achieve the same, albeit slightly more limited, functionality. See below:\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to see the functionality of the `@JsonProperty` annotation on enum values be extended to output the value as integers (and potentially other types) in the JSON output (and also deserialized with the same logic). I imagine a `@JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.NUMBER_INT)` annotation on the property in the POJO would define the output format of the enum value given to `@JsonProperty` as a string. Hence, see the example below.\r\n\r\n**Usage example**\r\n\r\nThe following example is taken from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52201603/15150382), an answer by user [SomethingSomething](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3322273/somethingsomething):\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic enum State {\r\n\r\n    @JsonProperty(\"0\")\r\n    OFF,\r\n\r\n    @JsonProperty(\"1\")\r\n    ON,\r\n\r\n    @JsonProperty(\"2\")\r\n    UNKNOWN\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe enum `State` in the following POJO would be serialized as `{\"state\": \"1\"}`, all good so far.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic record Pojo(\r\n\t@JsonProperty(\"state\") State state\r\n) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic record Pojo(\r\n    @JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.NUMBER_INT) @JsonProperty(\"state\") State state\r\n) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to see this case result in JSON such as `{\"state\": 1}`, with the value being a number (int in that case) instead of a string. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI know I can achieve the same functionality using `@JsonValue` and `@JsonCreator` annotations:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic enum State {\r\n\r\n    OFF(0),\r\n\r\n    ON(1),\r\n\r\n    UNKNOWN(2);\r\n\r\n    private final int value;\r\n\r\n    State(final int value) {\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @JsonValue\r\n    public int getValue() {\r\n        return value;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @JsonCreator\r\n    public State forValue(final int value) {\r\n        return Arrays.stream(values())\r\n                .filter(v -> v.value == value)\r\n                .findFirst()\r\n                .orElseThrow();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe proposed feature would allow us to shortcut these methods. Before Jackson supported the `@JsonProperty` annotation on enum values, the above was also the way to (de)serialize enums to other strings, this feature would extend the functionality of the `@JsonProperty` annotation to integers and potentially other types.\r\n\r\n\r\nI originally posted this idea in the Ideas section of the main Jackson repo, where [cowtowncoder](https://github.com/cowtowncoder) suggested filing a feature request here.\r\n\r\nI would like to see something like that be supported in some way or form.\r\n\r\n**Edit**:\r\nI'd like to emphasize that I want this feature to work even if the integer values from the example would be some values other than the ordinal values, i.e. the following would also work:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic enum State {\r\n\r\n    @JsonProperty(\"17\") OFF,\r\n\r\n    @JsonProperty(\"31\") ON,\r\n\r\n    @JsonProperty(\"99\") UNKNOWN\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the enum, when serialized as integers, would be serialized with integers 17, 31 and 99.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3580/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3580/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"joerg-d-schneider-db","id":86712138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzEyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86712138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db","html_url":"https://github.com/joerg-d-schneider-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerg-d-schneider-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-21T12:03:14Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T12:03:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo/issues/1533","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo/issues/1533/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo/issues/1533/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo/issues/1533/events","html_url":"https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo/issues/1533","id":1761701866,"node_id":"I_kwDOAKXrfM5pAW_q","number":1533,"title":"JSONB1

currently face a problem in our project where we try to switch from Jackson2 annotation style to JSONB1 if it comes to handle enum types.\r\n\r\nGiven the below json schema, the Jackson2 output

online)  \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n        \"type\" : \"object\",\r\n        \"properties\" : {\r\n            \"myEnum\" : {\r\n                \"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                \"enum\" : [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"]\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduces Jackson2 output like this\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@JsonCreator\r\npublic static Example.MyEnum fromValue(String value)

}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut produces JSONB1 output like this (note the missing `@JsonbCreator` annotation\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static Example.MyEnum fromValue(String value) {\r\n    Example.MyEnum
