implemented now, so `@JsonProperty(isRequired = OptBoolean.TRUE)` (etc) work.\n\nNoteworthy on defaulting:\n\n* In both 2.19 and 3.0, `isRequired` has precedence, used unless has value `OptBoolean.DEFAULT` (which is default value if property not included)\n* In 2.19, plain `required` is still considered exactly like before (cannot really change without compatibility problems) -- although we could of course add `MapperFeature` to change it if we really really want to. I don't think we do?\n* In 3.0, only value of `required = true` is considered (to mean property IS required) -- `required = false` is basically ignored, meaning same as `isRequired = OptBoolean.DEFAULT`.\n\nSo @k163377 I think Kotlin module 3.0 can implement better defaulting behavior.\n\nI think there was some issue here too, related... will see if I can find it.\n\n\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2716378662/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16704358793,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAC5e2c6tlLvxzwAAAAPjqEmJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/16704358793","actor":{"login":"k163377","id":24751011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzUxMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24751011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377","html_url":"https://github.com/k163377","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-12T04:07:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16704358800,"node_id":"SE_lADOAC5e2c6tlLvxzwAAAAPjqEmQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/16704358800","actor":{"login":"k163377","id":24751011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzUxMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24751011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377","html_url":"https://github.com/k163377","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-12T04:07:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"k163377","id":24751011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzUxMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24751011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377","html_url":"https://github.com/k163377","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k163377/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-19T17:04:38Z","updated_at":"2025-03-19T17:04:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/922/labels{/name}","comm

Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues) and found nothing similar.\n- [x] I have confirmed that the same problem is not reproduced if I exclude the KotlinModule.\n- [x] I searched in the [issues of databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and other modules used and found nothing similar.\n- [x] I have confirmed that the problem does not reproduce in Java and only occurs when using Kotlin and KotlinModule.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n`KotlinAnnotationIntrospector.hasRequiredMarker` has following problems\n\n1. If `nullToEmptyCollection` or `nullToEmptyMap` is specified, the specification by annotation is overridden.\n2. If `nullToEmptyCollection` or `nullToEmptyMap` is specified, the `KotlinModule` specification is applied to non `Kotlin` members.\n3. The `nullToEmptyCollection` and `nullToEmptyMap` only work with parameters for now, but as for `hasRequiredMarker`, it applies to fields, ~~setters~~ and getters.\n    - I created a test and confirmed that the setters were not affected.\n\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/blob/bab70c67769afcf4e0e913b8c86d29fbdc823eab/src/main/kotlin/com/fasterxml/jackson/module/kotlin/KotlinAnnotationIntrospector.kt#L41-L55\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nIt can be read from the code.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe behavior should satisfy the following three points\n\n1. Annotation specifications are not overridden as much as possible.\n2. Only apply to members defined in `Kotlin`.\n3. The `nullToEmptyCollection` and `nullToEmptyMap` are applied only to parameters.\n\n### Versions\n\nThis has not been corrected in 2.19.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIn the modification process, changes need to be made regarding the new `isRequired` property.\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5020#issuecomment-2716378662","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
