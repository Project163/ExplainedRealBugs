version: 2.8.1\n\nHi, \n\nI use jackson as a MessageBodyWriter and MessageBodyReader in jesery framwork.

But when i transfer a type mismatch json like \n\n`{\"post_id\": \"test\", \"post_title\": \"test\"'}`, the terrible situation appeared. \n\nI have a exception mapper to mapper a exception to a response, so in this case, when the type \n\nis mismatch, jackson will occur a InvalidFormatException:\n\n``` java\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException: Can not deserialize value

java\n@Provider\npublic class MyExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<Exception> {\n\n    public Response toResponse(Exception ex) {\n\n\n        if (App.isDebug()) {\n

{\n            return Response.status(500)\n                    .entity(ex)\n                    .type(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n                    .build();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen, as you see, the infinite recursion appeared.  Why i get this terrible error?  If i dont pack the \n\nInvalidFormatException and use another exception to wrap the response entity, every thins is ok!\n\nHopeful to get the reply, i debugged whole day, StackOverFlow is really a disaster.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
