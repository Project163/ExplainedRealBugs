implementation is fine, but there is one open issue I am wondering about: how to detect non-updateable Objects, and what to do about them.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, there is a method added in 2.9 to detect types for which \"merge\" does not work:\r\n\r\n    public Boolean supportsUpdate(DeserializationConfig config) ...\r\n\r\nwhich rules out a class of types, most notable scalars.\r\nBut aside this, there are types that physically do not allow changes -- arrays, specifically have fixed size; and `String`s are immutable -- but may allow logical changes (appending an array works by creating a new one).\r\nSo to support merging, this method operates for logical, not physical changes, and thereby does not prevent merging of arrays.\r\n\r\nHowever, here we are returning exact first argument. So, in case of arrays, we could do one of following choices:\r\n\r\n1. Prevent operation for all arrays (and perhaps small number of other types if need be) -- would be hard-coded, so custom handlers could not override (if user wanted different semantic of \"update\")\r\n2. Let operation proceed, but returning first argument: essentially quietly failing (but no exception)\r\n3. Change semantics to return whatever `ObjectReader.readValue()` returns, which may be first argument, or a newly allocated other object.\r\n\r\nI guess I could see either (1) or (3) working. If we went with (3), however, maybe name \"updateValue()\" would not make sense after all. We could consider some other name, which would reflect the fact that operation may either update given Object, or create a new Object that is combination of two input Objects.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I think I'll check in my work so far, even if it is likely to change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/287490714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1005277281,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwMDUyNzcyODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1005277281","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8f8904a0b10005a214f15e3831504dd594f65a62","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/8f8904a0b10005a214f15e3831504dd594f65a62","created_at":"2017-03-17T23:05:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1005277296,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEwMDUyNzcyOTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1005277296","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-17T23:05:56Z","label":{"name":"ACTIVE","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1007982709,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTAwNzk4MjcwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1007982709","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}"
