2.18 jackson-databind has a new, rewritten logic for POJO Property detection: work was done mostly under https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4515.\r\n\r\nLogic, at high-level, selects at most one \"Properties-based\" Creator (constructor / static factory method), in following order:\r\n\r\n1. Explicitly annotated (either `@JsonCreator` on ctor/factory, or at least one parameter of ctor/factory annotated with `@JsonProperty`)\r\n2. Default/preferred/primary -- currently only detected for Record types (canonical constructor)\r\n3. Implicit Constructor: if all parameters of a constructor have implicit names, is visible (by default: public) and there is only one such choice (not even 0-args \"default\" constructor)\r\n\r\nOh these steps, (2) is basically new category added, to better support \"no-annotations\" use case but with reliable detection and mode selection.\r\n\r\nThis works for many cases. But JVM languages like Scala (and Kotlin) typically have their own definitions of a default constructor, so it'd be good to allow pluggable handling.\r\n(in plain Java we only have Records with the concept of specific canonical (primary) constructor, over alternatives that are also visible)\r\n\r\nMy initial idea would be to add one (ideally) new method in `AnnotationIntrospector`, which would take 2 sets of candidates -- Constructors and Factory Methods (`PotentialCreator`) -- that might qualify; and result would be zero or one of passed-in choices to indicate Default/preferred, Properties-based creator to use, if any.\r\nMethod would only be called (or its return value used) if no explicit choice were found.\r\n\r\nWould this make sense from Kotlin module perspective @k163377 @JooHyukKim ?\r\n\r\nMy intent is specifically to allow code in module to get simpler, get better out-of-the-box support for core Jackson annotations, and not to complicate things.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: now databind issue [#4584](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4584) has been implemented, adding `AnnotationIntrospector.findDefaultCreator(...)` which would be the mechanism.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"yihtserns","id":3615932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTU5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3615932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns","html_url":"https://github.com/yihtserns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihtserns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-20T11:48:03Z","updated_at":"2024-06-20T11:48:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3758","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3758/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3758/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3758/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3758","id":1560690988,"node_id":"I_kwDOAC5e2c5dBkEs","number":3758,"title":"Make

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n`AnnotationIntrospector` registered with `appendAnnotationIntrospector` is expected to be called after all higher priority `AnnotationIntrospectors` have been processed.\r\nFor example, if a `JsonCreator` is present in the class, the `findCreatorAnnotation` function is not expected to be called.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the current situation, all `AnnotationIntrospectors` will try to process one target.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nEnsure that `AnnotationIntrospectors` registered with `appendAnnotationIntrospector` are called after all `AnnotationIntrospectors` with higher priority have been processed.\r\n\r\n**Usage example**\r\nBy changing the behavior in this way, processing related to the case where nothing is specified can be implemented.\r\nIn the `findJsonCreator` function example, such an implementation currently requires checking that the class does not contain any other `JsonCreator`.\r\nAlso, it is not possible to implement the function in such a way that it does not overwrite a `JsonCreator` that is specified with a higher priority by another module.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis would require a huge change, such as eliminating `AnnotationIntrospectorPair`.\r\nProbably not possible to achieve this until `Jackson 3.0`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13343707053,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAC5e2c6MZKPSzwAAAAMbWM-t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/13343707053","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-01T01:11:04Z","label":{"name":"to-evaluate","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13343707059,"node_id":"LE_lADOAC5e2c6MZKPSzwAAAAMbWM-z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/13343707059","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-01T01:11:04Z","label":{"name":"2.18","color":"1D76DB"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13412510667,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c6MZKPSzwAAAAMfcqvL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/13412510667","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"47c04b3a12ab46b808e4d543dffeee977d538d23","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/47c04b3a12ab46b808e4d543dffeee977d538d23","created_at":"2024-07-06T22:13:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncod
