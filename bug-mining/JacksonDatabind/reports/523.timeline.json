So I do not think changing that access method is usually the right way to go -- it just opens up a fragile, unsupported extension point; something that will likely break when databind needs to pass some more information. Not sure why constructor for deserializer is left non-private; perhaps an oversight.\r\nGranted, use of reflection is even worse, and even more likely to break with new versions (private methods not being considered part of API and changeable on any minor version).\r\n\r\nBut adding an alternative factory method could be a slightly better choice. Perhaps one that would take `PropertyNamingStrategy` (along your suggestion).\r\nWhile it is designed for property name handling, it could probably be used for `Enum`s as values as defined as... `Method`s I think? (or possibly `Field`s, would need to check).\r\n\r\nI am open to other ideas, PRs.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/603271561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/604144653","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2663#issuecomment-604144653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2663","id":604144653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDE0NDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-25T23:35:29Z","updated_at":"2020-03-25T23:53:18Z","body":"One quick thing that I can easily add, and have no problems with is to just add matching factory method in 2.11.

the bug**\r\nArray of number does not parse.\r\nproblem: argument type mismatch (through reference chain: java.lang.Object[][0])\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.12.0\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSample in Java\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Foo {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n        Type type = Operation[].class;\r\n

JSON \"[1,3]\" does not work;\r\nI did not find in the change logs changes of this behavior.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3006/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
