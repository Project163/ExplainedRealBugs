#2725 was finally resolved and released with 2.11.1 I had another try to upgrade from 2.10.4, as far as I have seen and tested it map keys are now working quite well but the upgrade broke the \"normal\" JsonCreator behaviour from 2.10.4 in enums. \r\n\r\nIt is quite hard to explain under which conditions it works and it doesn't but I was able to create one reproduced for the
