think the problem is that unless you can provide tight type definition for nested Maps, key deserializer is looked up for type `Object` and not `String`. Whether this is a bug or not in Jackson is debatable (it can be definitely be unexpected); not 100% sure if changing it would be safe (esp. for backwards-compatibility).\r\n\r\nBut I think you can register same `KeyDeserializer` for `Object.class` too. Either by adding another registration call for `SimpleModule`, or implementing `KeyDeserializers` callback which could return same instance for different `JavaType`s.\r\nSecond approach could be helpful for debugging as well.\r\n\r\nIf registering of key deserializer for `Object.class` doesn't work, that's a

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to achieve functionality as per title by making any-getter a `BeanPropertyWriter` (subtype).\r\nPreviously any-getter property has been handled as standalone. Being standalone meaning it need individual handling for all cases, unlike other sub-classes of `BeanPropertyWriter` naturally gets bunch of property handling applied.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nSame as #4396, but rebased against 2.19 version.
