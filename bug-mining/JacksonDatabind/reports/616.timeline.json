the bug**\r\nJDK 16 introduced `Stream#toList()` which creates `UnmodifiableList` while `.collect(Collectors.toList())` generates `ArrayList`.\r\nChanging the old collectors toList with the direct call to  `Stream#toList()` caused errors when deserealizing with `defaultTyping` configuration\r\n\r\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidTypeIdException: Could not resolve type id 'a' as a subtype of `java.lang.Object`: no such class found\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\njackson 2.13.1\r\njdk 16\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n    var objectMapper = new ObjectMapper()\r\n        .activateDefaultTyping(LaissezFaireSubTypeValidator.instance, ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL);\r\n\r\n    // works\r\n    var list1 = Stream.of(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\").collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n    var json1 = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(list1);\r\n    var deserealized1 = objectMapper.readValue(json1, Object.class);\r\n    System.out.println(deserealized1);\r\n\r\n    // fails\r\n    var list2 = Stream.of(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\").toList();\r\n    var json2 = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(list2);\r\n    var deserealized2 = objectMapper.readValue(json2, Object.class);\r\n    System.out.println(deserealized2);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt is expected Jackson to deserialize the types correctly.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nProbably related issue:
