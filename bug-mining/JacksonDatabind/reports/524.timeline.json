things are, the only way to change representation of `Enum` values (which defaults to using `Enum.name()`) is to use either \"use `toString()`\" or explicit `@JsonProperty` overrides.\nBut it appears that there is usage where there is naming convention in use, similar to how `@JsonNaming` works mapping POJO fields to external JSON property names.\n\nOne possibility might be to try to directly support use of `@JsonNaming` on `Enum` classes.\nThis may or may not be practical, considering underlying `PropertyNamingStrategy` is tied to accessors (Field, Method) that POJOs expose -- but bigger issue may be that this would be two-dimensional mapping as unlike POJO property names that use Bean naming ([lower] camel case), Enum names themselves may use one convention, and external names another one.\nAs such it may be necessary to either come up with new abstraction(s), or maybe just alternate `PropertyNamingStrategy` implementations.\n\nNOTE: implementation adds\n\n* `@EnumNaming` annotation\n* with `EnumNamingStrategy` (for strategy implementations)\n* `EnumNamingStrategies` container for a set of out-of-the-box `EnumNamingStrategy` implementations\n    * For 2.15, only `CamelCaseStrategy` added -- replaced in 2.19 with `LowerCamelCaseStrategy`\n\nJackson 2.19 will further add a large set of new strategy
