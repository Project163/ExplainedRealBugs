Actually, no, I think that the code as is can not work properly, and the reason Jackson 2.6 worked with it was due to a (lucky) flaw.\n\nThe problem is as follows: class `MyHashMap` is defined as:\n\n``` java\nclass MyHashMap<K, V extends HasUniqueId<K>>\n    extends LinkedHashMap<K, V>\n    implements AnotherMap<K, V> {\n...\n}\n```\n\nwhich is fine as is, setting bounds. But the creator method is static:\n\n``` java\n    @JsonCreator\n    public static <K, V extends HasUniqueId<K>> MyHashMap<K, V> fromArray(V[] values) {\n    }\n```\n\nand type variables `K` and `V` are NOT the same as those in class declaration: they can not be, as method is `static`; static methods can not refer to type parameters of declaring class (if they could, you would not need to declare them locally, after all).\n\nBecause of this, method only has bound of `extends HasUniqueId` and can not refer to type `Item` that would be needed.\n\nSo why did this work with Jackson 2.6? Because Jackson type resolution got fooled by declarations and assumed `K` and `V` from class declaration are valid. But luckily for this case, it worked out in the end.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/215999375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":646635742,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjQ2NjM1NzQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/646635742","actor":{"login":"brentryan","id":1102801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDI4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1102801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan","html_url":"https://github.com/brentryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-30T22:17:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":646635743,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDY0NjYzNTc0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/646635743","actor":{"login":"brentryan","id":1102801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDI4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1102801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan","html_url":"https://github.com/brentryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-30T22:17:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/215999623","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1215#issuecomment-215999623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1215","id":215999623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTk5OTYyMw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"

So how to fix the code to work? Well, ideally you would be able to choose local types for creator method to work properly, so that instead of base of abstract `HasUniqueId`, value is of type `Item`.\nI couldn't get that to work with simple mechanism, but I did get following variant to pass test:\n\n``` java\n    @JsonCreator\n    public static <K, V extends HasUniqueId<K>> MyHashMap<K, V> fromArray(Item[] values) {\n        MyHashMap<K, V> map = new MyHashMap<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {\n            Item v = values[i];\n            if (v.getId() == null) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to get id\");\n            }\n            if (map.containsKey(v.getId())) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(\"Conflict on id\");\n            }\n            map.put((K) v.getId(), (V) v);\n        }\n        return map;\n    }\n```\n\nit's bit nasty what with forced casts, and has to hard-code `Item` in signature. But there isn't much more you can do with static methods, as they can not vary by instance type. You could, however, define actual constructor, as constructors are member methods and are able to access type parameters just fine. That might be much better solution. Following _should_ work:\n\n``` java\n    @JsonCreator(mode=JsonCreator.Mode.DELEGATING) // probably fine without mod too\n    public MyHashMap(V[] values) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {\n            V v = values[i];\n            if (v.getId() == null) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to get id\");\n            }\n            if (containsKey(v.getId())) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(\"Conflict on id\");\n            }\n            put(v.getId(), v);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nbut seems to have some issues, unlike static version above. I'll see if I can work around this issue.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/215999623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/216007884","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1215#issuecomment-216007884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1215","id":216007884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjAwNzg4NA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-01T01:57:50Z","updated_at":"2016-05-01T01:57:50Z","body":"Ok.
