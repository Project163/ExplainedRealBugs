We are renaming one of the getters for the class and we want to have the old name work so it's easier to migrate. The class looks like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@AutoValue\r\n@JsonTypeName(\"user\")\r\npublic abstract class UserEventContext implements EventContext {\r\n\r\n     public abstract String getId();\r\n\r\n    public abstract String getPartitionId();\r\n\r\n    public abstract String getAccountId();\r\n\r\n    public abstract Optional<String> getDeviceId();\r\n\r\n    @JsonCreator\r\n    public static UserEventContext create(@JsonProperty(\"partitionId\") String partitionId,\r\n            @JsonProperty(\"accountId\") String accountId,\r\n            @JsonProperty(\"id\") @JsonAlias(\"userId\") String userId,\r\n            @Nullable @JsonProperty(\"deviceId\") String deviceId) {\r\n        return new AutoValue_UserEventContext(userId, partitionId, accountId, Optional.ofNullable(deviceId));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `@JsonAlias` on the 3rd parameter is ignored and the AutoValue constructor throws an error because the argument is null. \r\n\r\nI dug through the bean deserializer code and it looks like the problem is that the aliases never get registered because it's an abstract class.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
