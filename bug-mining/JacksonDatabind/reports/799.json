Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nNow that https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1484 has changed the default of `MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION` to `false` in 3.0, I think `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNEXPECTED_VIEW_PROPERTIES` should be either disabled by default, or only throw exception when `MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION` is set to `true`, otherwise the behavior is very annoying and confusing for IMO no good reason.\n\n### Version Information\n\n3.0.0-rc3\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```java\n\tinterface SafeToDeserialize {}\n\n\tprivate static class User {\n\n\t\t@JsonView(SafeToDeserialize.class)\n\t\tprivate String username;\n\n\t\tprivate String password;\n\n\t\tpublic User() {\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpublic User(String username, String password) {\n\t\t\tthis.username = username;\n\t\t\tthis.password = password;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpublic String getUsername() {\n\t\t\treturn username;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpublic void setUsername(String username) {\n\t\t\tthis.username = username;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpublic String getPassword() {\n\t\t\treturn password;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpublic void setPassword(String password) {\n\t\t\tthis.password = password;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t@Test\n\tvoid test() {\n\t\tJsonMapper mapper = JsonMapper.builder()\n\t\t\t\t// Will be the default as of Jackson 3.O0.0-rc4\n\t\t\t\t.disable(MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION)\n\t\t\t\t.build();\n\t\tString data = \"{\\\"username\\\":\\\"foo\\\",\\\"password\\\":\\\"bar\\\"}\";\n\t\tUser user = mapper.readerFor(User.class).withView(SafeToDeserialize.class).readValue(data);\n\t\tassertThat(user.getUsername()).isEqualTo(\"foo\");\n\t\tassertThat(user.getPassword()).isNull();\n\t}\n``` \n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCurrently this test require `disable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNEXPECTED_VIEW_PROPERTIES)` to pass, which is confusing since password is not deserialized due to `MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION` now being disabled. The current behavior will be even more confusing with upcoming `MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION` set to `false` by default in Jackson 3.0.0-rc4.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis use case is very popular in Spring applications.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
