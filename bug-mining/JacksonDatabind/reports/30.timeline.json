With version 2.3, the only places I see are short sync blocks around `LRUMap`, which is a `LinkedHashMap` sub-class. And while one could use concurrent variants, this just doesn't seem like it should not be called extensively enough to matter.\nWhich version are you using?\n\nThere are couple of work-arounds that could help. Basically the goal of `TypeFactory` is to construct `JavaType` instances out of `Class` (and `TypeReference`); use of `JavaType` has no sync blocks. Two ways to do this are:\n1. Use `ObjectReader` instead of `ObjectMapper`, holding on to `ObjectReader`:\n    final ObjectReader typeXReader = mapper.reader(TypeX.class);\n    TypeX value = typeXTreader.readValue(src);\n2. Construct `JavaType`, pass that instead of `Class`:\n   final JavaType typeXType = mapper.constructType(MyType.class);\n   TypeX value = mapper.readValue(src, typeXType);\n\nthese are actually preferable anyway (`ObjectReader` can also eliminate overhead of looking up `JsonDeserializer` for root type), although performance benefits may not be enough to convert code just to get speed up (on a good day you might see 5-10% speed up for small classes etc, nice but nothing major).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/39796596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/39797419","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/435#issuecomment-39797419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/435","id":39797419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Nzk3NDE5","user":{"login":"sdonovanuk","id":7217102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTcxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7217102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk","html_url":"https://github.com/sdonovanuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdonovanuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-07T23:47:53Z","updated_at":"2014-04-07T23:47:53Z","body":"Thanks for looking into it.  The problem is that the code that calls readValue(..) doesn't use concrete types -- it is also generic.  It is part of our application's serialization framework.

com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper._configAndWriteValue(ObjectMapper.java:2866)\n7819         at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.writeValue(ObjectMapper.java:2289)\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the issue, we found out that the implementation of com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.util.LRUMap.get(Object) incorrectly assumes that the superclass implementation of this method is read-only. This is not true because the constructor of LRUMap sets the accessOrder to true, thus allowing get() to promote changes in the internal structure of the map in order to optimize the access (see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html for further details).\n\nGiven that, the implementation of com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.util.LRUMap.get(Object) must be protect the call with a write lock instead of a read lock:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic V get(Object key) {\n    _writeLock.lock();\n    try {\n        return super.get(key);\n    } finally {\n        _writeLock.unlock();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt is also possible to solve this issue by changing the constructor parameter accessOrder to false instead and leave the current implementation of the get() as is. This however will disable the LRU behavior of this implementation.\n\nI know that this change will result in performance issues due to the need of synchronization. I'll test the performance of other synchronization options as well in order to determine what is the best solution for this problem.\n\nAs far as I could see, this issue is closely related to the issue #435.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/48742617","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/435#issuecomment-48742617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/435","id":48742617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzQyNjE3","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-11T15:12:08Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T15:12:08Z","body":"Ouch.
