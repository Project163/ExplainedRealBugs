Jackson adapted handling for Optional serialization providing a custom exception message if Optional is being serialized. Scout does not support serialization of Java Optional, therefore adapt test case. See also:\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4082 https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/d7e77c39ebf477a4b1e8732b3bae9e4d4fd2a994\r\n\r\n(2) Jackson adapted handling for untyped deserialization of floating point numbers. Former implementations (before 2.15) deserialized floating point numbers within lists as BigDecimal. Since issue 903 and 3751 numbers are deserialized into the smalles possible Java data type (same behavior as plain numbers not within a JSON list element). Therefore Scout DoCollectionDeserializer was adapted identically to DoEntityDeserializer to enforce using BigDecimal for unknown (raw) number deserialization.\r\n\r\nSee

Jackson adapted handling for Optional serialization providing a custom exception message if Optional is being serialized. Scout does not support serialization of Java Optional, therefore adapt test case. See also:\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4082 https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/d7e77c39ebf477a4b1e8732b3bae9e4d4fd2a994\r\n\r\n(2) Jackson adapted handling for untyped deserialization of floating point numbers. Former implementations (before 2.15) deserialized floating point numbers within lists as BigDecimal. Since issue 903 and 3751 numbers are deserialized into the smalles possible Java data type (same behavior as plain numbers not within a JSON list element). Therefore Scout DoCollectionDeserializer was adapted identically to DoEntityDeserializer to enforce using BigDecimal for unknown (raw) number deserialization.\r\n\r\nSee

change.\r\nAs a workaround I can register the Jdk8Module manually (commented out in the code above), to produce the same results as in 2.15.4\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n2.17.0\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nRun the example using the maven dependencies\r\n\r\n- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.15.4\r\n- com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jdk8:2.15.4\r\n\r\nafter switching to 2.16.0, 2.16.1, 2.17.0 the same code below fails\r\n\r\n- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.0\r\n- com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jdk8:2.17.0\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.json.JsonMapper;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jdk8.Jdk8Module;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\nimport java.util.Optional;\r\n\r\npublic class Jackson2_17_Test_Optional {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n\r\n        Map<String, Optional<String>> object = Map.of(\r\n                \"test\", Optional.of(\"optional value\"));\r\n\r\n        JsonMapper jsonMapper = JsonMapper.builder()\r\n//                .addModule(new Jdk8Module()) // workaround, register jdk8 module manually\r\n                .build();\r\n        String value = jsonMapper.writeValueAsString(object);\r\n        System.out.println(value);\r\n\r\n        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n//        objectMapper.registerModule(new Jdk8Module()); // workaround, register jdk8 module manually\r\n        String value2 = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(object);\r\n        System.out.println(value2);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\ngiving the output as in 2.15.4, not throwing an exception\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"test\":{\"empty\":false,\"present\":true}}\r\n{\"test\":{\"empty\":false,\"present\":true}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\neven though we have a manual workaround it's difficult to track and adjust all usages by external libraries.\r\n\r\nmy apologies in case I missed the related documentation and this is the new expected behavior since
