I will have to think about this a bit, to figure out whether this works as expected, or if it is a bug.\nAnd even if \"works as expected\" it could still be something to improve upon.\n\nThe main question here is whether implicit name of 'str' creator argument is known; it appears it might be, because that's what is indicates as ambiguous (creator parameter \"renamed\" as 'str'; getter-induced property renamed as \"s\"). But then again, unless field is detected, things should be fine, because all accessors are explicitly renamed, and no ambiguity should exist.\n\nSo I guess it looks like this could be considered a bug.\n\nOne last thing: is this with 2.4.2?

is similar to a previous issue (#541), but I think is a bit different because the previous issue didn't use mix-ins, which might the cause of the trouble I'm getting.\n\n```\npublic class TestData {\n

`TestData.View` view. I expect to get the JSON `{\"decoratedProp\":123}`, but instead I get `{\"prop\":123}`, plus the following exception in my logs:\n\n`T+546256 [http-nio-8443-exec-6] WARN  o.s.h.c.j.MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter - Failed to evaluate serialization for type [class c.r.s.a.a.d.TestData]: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Conflicting/ambiguous property name definitions (implicit name 'prop'): found multiple explicit names: [prop, decoratedProp], but also implicit accessor: [field c.r.s.a.a.d.TestData#prop][visible=true,ignore=false,explicitName=false]`\n\nNote that the problem goes away if I switch to setting the `@JsonView()` annotation on the getter method, rather than the field.
