       this(name, parseNonSerializableField(rawQuery), rawQuery)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `NonSerializableClass` is a complicated external class that I do not want to write custom (de)serializers for, and whose instances can be easily created by parsing the `rawQuery` string.\r\n\r\nWith Jackson 2.9.3 and `jackson-module-kotlin` 2.9.3 string of the kind `{\"name\": \"foo\", \"query\": \"bar\"}` get nicely serialized into `DTO` and the object created can be nicely deserialized.\r\n\r\nBut with Jackson + `jackson-module-kotlin` 2.9.4 I get a `com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.MissingKotlinParameterException` \"due to missing (therefore NULL) value for creator parameter rawQuery which is a non-nullable type\" (but after a bit of fiddling with it, I found out that the real problem is that there is a `@JsonIgnore val query` – with the same name as a `@JsonProperty(\"name\")` of another field).\r\n\r\nA minimal test for this, that passes with version 2.9.3, but fails with 2.9.4, looks like this:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.KotlinModule\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.readValue\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test\r\n\r\ninternal class DeserializationTest {\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun test() {\r\n        val objMapper = ObjectMapper().registerModule(KotlinModule())\r\n\r\n        // with 2.9.3 prints\r\n        //     Foo(name=foo, query=NonSerializable, rawQuery=bar)\r\n        // but with 2.9.4 throws:\r\n        //     com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.MissingKotlinParameterException: Instantiation of [simple type, class DeserializationTest$Foo] value failed for JSON property query due to missing (therefore NULL) value for creator parameter rawQuery which is a non-nullable type\r\n        //      at [Source: (String)\"{\"name\": \"foo\", \"query\": \"bar\"}\"; line: 1, column: 31] (through reference chain: DeserializationTest$Foo[\"query\"])\r\n        val deserialized: Foo = objMapper.readValue(\"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"foo\\\", \\\"query\\\": \\\"bar\\\"}\")\r\n        println(deserialized)\r\n\r\n        val serialized = objMapper.writeValueAsString(deserialized)\r\n\r\n        // with 2.9.3 prints\r\n        //     {\"name\":\"foo\",\"query\":\"bar\"}\r\n        println(serialized)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class NonSerializable(private val field: Any?) {\r\n        override fun toString() = \"NonSerializable\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    data class Foo(@JsonProperty(\"name\") val name: String,\r\n                   @JsonIgnore val query: NonSerializable,\r\n                   @JsonProperty(\"query\") val rawQuery: String) {\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        constructor(@JsonProperty(\"name\") name: String,\r\n                    @JsonProperty(\"query\") rawQuery: String): this(name, NonSerializable(rawQuery), rawQuery)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter changing the name of the non-serializable `@JsonIgnore`d field `query` to something else, like `ignoredQuery`, it works in 2.9.4 too.\r\n\r\nBut that still looks like a bug, and I’d like not to change the API of my class (where value `query` returns the non-serializable object) nor to force all places where this data class is serialized to change its JSON schema (to use another field like eg. `rawQuery` instead of `query`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/124/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/124/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/382483563","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2001#issuecomment-382483563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2001","id":382483563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjQ4MzU2Mw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-18T18:26:00Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T18:26:00Z","body":"One

is my first time with this codebase, so this may be wrong, but I did my best to understand what was going on.\r\n\r\nBasically, I changed the renamed property set to a multimap, keeping track of which property definitions were involved in the rename. This allows us to undo the ignoring of a property when it's renamed for #2001, by checking if the renaming property is one of the ones that originally ignored it.\r\n\r\nThen I added logic to update the list of ignored properties to the new name.\r\n\r\nI did some minor refactoring in `_renameProperties` while I was there in service to this change. I found the original generic names in some places hard to understand, so I made them more descriptive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"VSMent","id":16166824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY2ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16166824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent","html_url":"https://github.com/VSMent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VSMent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-13T16:09:57Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T16:09:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/308","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/308/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/308/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/308/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/308","id":580701632,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODA3MDE2MzI=","number":308,"title":"Jackson
