Unexpected, too... fix only seemed to affect cases where `Z` is part of value, and nothing else. But with `StdDateFormat` also being a mess it is possible it composes string with `Z`, uses that format.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could help here is that a test and fix could result in release of `2.8.9.1` of `jackson-databind` (micro-patch), since I am not sure if or when 2.8.10 would be released.\r\nObviously if you have other related tests those would be great; or, at least maybe we could

with Jackson `2.8.8` and `2.8.9`.\r\n\r\nThe general rule with the StdDateFormat with regards to the TimeZone is:\r\n```\r\n     the TimeZone of the ObjectMapper is used if the JSON input does not contain\r\n     any timezone/offset information.\r\n\r\n     If the mapper timezone is set to GMT+1, the input 2000-01-01T00:00:00.000\r\n     (no timezone) will produce a date 2000-01-01T00:00:00.000+01:00\r\n```\r\n        \r\nThis rule remains valid when the `@JsonFormat` annotation is used on a property unless it forces an explicit timezeone, in which case it takes precedence.\r\n\r\nOne would expect the same behavior when the StdDateFormat is replaced by a custom DateFormat on the ObjectMapper. In other words, the timezone of the DateFormat should be of no importance since the ObjectMapper's default is used whenever needed.\r\n\r\nHowever it appears this behaviour is not always respected and *depends on whether the mapper has been explicitly configured with a TimeZone or not*.\r\n\r\nSuppose the following custom date format:\r\n```\r\nDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd'X'HH:mm:ss\");\r\ndf.setTimeZone( TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"GMT+4\") );\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse it on a vanilla ObjectMapper without any further configuration:\r\n```\r\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\nmapper.setDateFormat(df);\r\nDate d = mapper.readValue(\"2000-01-02X04:00:00\", Date.class);\r\n```\r\nThis produces a date with `GMT+4` although we would expect UTC according to the \"rules\" described above.\r\n\r\nDo a second test and use the same date format on an ObjectMapper whose timezone is explicitly set to UTC. Since UTC is the default, this test should behave as the first...\r\n```\r\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\nmapper.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"UTC\"));\r\nmapper.setDateFormat(df);\r\nDate d = mapper.readValue(\"2000-01-02X04:00:00\", Date.class);\r\n```\r\nNow this produces a date in `UTC` and not `GMT+4` anymore.. This is compliant with the rules, but unexpected in the light of the first test.\r\nDo the test once more with `GMT+2` instead go `UTC` and the date will be in `GMT+2`...\r\n\r\nThis case is covered by the `DateDeserializationTest#testDateUtil_customDateFormat_withoutTZ()` test case submitted in PR https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/pull/1660.\r\n\r\nCould this be related to
