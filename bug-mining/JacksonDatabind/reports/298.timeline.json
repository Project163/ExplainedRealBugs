getting a StackOverflowError when I try to use this class with Jackson:\n\n```\npublic class DataDefinition extends HashMap<String, DataDefinition> {\n  public DataDefinition definition;\n  public DataDefinition elements;\n  public String regex;\n  public boolean required;\n  public String type;\n}\n```\n\nHere's a snippet of the stack trace I get:\n\n```\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.ResolvedRecursiveType.toString(ResolvedRecursiveType.java:90)\n    at java.lang.String.valueOf(String.java:2994)\n    at java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:131)\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.MapType.toString(MapType.java:161)\n    at java.lang.String.valueOf(String.java:2994)\n    at java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:131)\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.ResolvedRecursiveType.toString(ResolvedRecursiveType.java:90)\n    at java.lang.String.valueOf(String.java:2994)\n```\n\nI did some debugging and found that this looks like the location where the stack track starts:\n\n```\n    public StdValueInstantiator(DeserializationConfig config, JavaType valueType) {\n        _valueTypeDesc = (valueType == null) ? \"UNKNOWN TYPE\" : valueType.toString();\n        _valueClass = (valueType == null) ? Object.class : valueType.getRawClass();\n    }\n```\n\nIt's line 87 in StdValueInstantiator. That looks like it is calling toString() on the on the type and then it goes into an infinite recursion state. I'm not sure why the toString() call is necessary, but it seems like all of this is for debugging and errors and pre-calculating the string is preventing Jackson from working at all even if there isn't an error.\n\n**WORK-AROUND:** In case anyone looks at this issue and needs a work around, you can use the @JsonAnySetter to fix this issue. Here's the code:\n\n```\npublic class DataDefinition {\n  public DataDefinition definition;\n  public DataDefinition elements;\n  @JsonAnySetter\n  public Map<String, DataDefinition> properties = new HashMap<>();\n  public String regex;\n  public boolean required;\n  public String type;\n}\n```\n\nI also think that this can likely be fixed with code like this:\n\n_com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.MapType.java#toString()_\n\n```\n    public String toString()\n    {\n        if ((_keyType instance ResolvedRecursiveType && ((ResolvedRecursiveType) _keyType).getSelfReferencedType() == this) || (_valueType instance ResolvedRecursiveType && ((ResolvedRecursiveType) _valueType).getSelfReferencedType() == this)) {\n            return \"[map type; class \"+_class.getName()+\", \"+_keyType+\" -> self]\";\n        }\n        return \"[map type; class \"+_class.getName()+\", \"+_keyType+\" -> \"+_valueType+\"]\";\n    }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/308488678","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1658#issuecomment-308488678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1658","id":308488678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODQ4ODY3OA==","user":{"login":"newkek","id":3471564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3471564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek","html_url":"https://github.com/newkek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-14T16:39:21Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T16:39:21Z","body":"This also occurs with 2.8.7 fwiw.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/308488678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"newkek","id":3471564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3471564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek","html_url":"https://github.com/newkek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/308580330","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1658#issuecomment-308580330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1658","id":308580330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODU4MDMzMA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-14T22:51:42Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T22:51:42Z","body":"I think I'd need a reproduction here (code above gets close.

so I pushed a self-contained test case over here: https://gist.github.com/newkek/d8998836dcdba91cc92bf5d03d46aea7\r\n\r\n*Important:* After more tests, I think it seems like the issue has nothing to do with what I expected. You see that in the `Tree` class I included in the test class, there is a method:\r\n```java\r\npublic List<Tree<T>> getLeafTrees()\r\n```\r\nThat method is never called, and it doesn't do anything in this code snippet. **However**, it turns out that if I rename the method, or remove the word \"get\" in the beginning of it, **I do not get the SOE anymore**. Do you think that this could be due to some kind of \"getter inspection\" mechanism in the Jackson code by any chance?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you manage to reproduce, and thanks for looking into it.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/309128577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"newkek","id":3471564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3471564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek","html_url":"https://github.com/newkek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/309134319","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1658#issuecomment-309134319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1658","id":309134319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTEzNDMxOQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:06:50Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T21:09:29Z","body":"Much appreciated, thank you!\r\n\r\nAs to why there is very specific path that triggers it: I bet it's a specific side effect -- yes, POJO introspection will eventually discard \"methods of no interest\", and difference between getter (via naming convention) and other methods is such that one is not introspected further, and one is.\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting that `equals()` is called: this is not that often needed for type instances, but is used when determining compatibility of getters (for example when sub-class overrides things; or when matching mix-in annotations).\r\n\r\nSo all in all it is not completely surprising that difference you see exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/309134319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1127648094,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDExMjc2NDgwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1127648094","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T23:14:46Z","milestone":{"title":"2.8.10"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127648245,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDExMjc2NDgyNDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1127648245","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"075319dbf91d6c091c78a3b7c686b579569678e1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/075319dbf91d6c091c78a3b7c686b579569678e1","created_at":"2017-06-16T23:14:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127648624,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTEyNzY0ODYyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1127648624","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events
