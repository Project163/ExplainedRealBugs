just been thinking about this issue and have a question. \r\n\r\nLets say we have the following two classes (borrowed from some of the tests)\r\n```\r\n@JsonTypeInfo(use=JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME)\r\nstatic abstract class SuperType {}\r\n\r\nstatic class Sub extends SuperType {\r\n    public int a;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen from the Deserialization side of things I understand that we should expect the following to create two similar objects of type `Sub` with field `a` having a value of 1.\r\n```\r\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\nmapper.registerSubtypes(new NamedType(Sub.class, \"sub1\"));\r\nmapper.registerSubtypes(new NamedType(Sub.class, \"sub2\"));\r\nSuperType bean1 = mapper.readValue(\"{\\\"@type\\\":\\\"sub1\\\", \\\"a\\\":1}\", SuperType.class);\r\nSuperType bean2 = mapper.readValue(\"{\\\"@type\\\":\\\"sub2\\\", \\\"a\\\":1}\", SuperType.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever from the Serialization side of things what would be the expected behavior of the following:\r\n```\r\nObjectMapper mapper = new

However when we serialize a field we rely on `TypeNameIdResolver::idFromValue` to resolve the field id. This method relies only on the Object itself and not the field name. Also `TypeNameIdResolver` stores it's id information in a `Map<String, String>` which maps class names to ids. I'll have to look into it more tomorrow to see how we can include the field name to resolve the id, because currently that class can only store one id per class.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/545747004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2739362059,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjczOTM2MjA1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2739362059","actor":{"login":"mbaechler","id":708318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODMxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/708318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaechler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-24T05:10:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2739362061,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3MzkzNjIwNjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2739362061","actor":{"login":"mbaechler","id":708318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODMxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/708318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaechler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaechler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-24T05:10:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/546017602","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2515#issuecomment-546017602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2515","id":546017602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjAxNzYwMg==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_adm

To claierfy: registering of subtypes absolutely must be done before any use, and it is not something that can be done after use -- this is explicitly declared as \"does not work\" wrt \"config-then-use\" pattern.

I think I misunderstood the test I was referencing. It wasn't testing overriding a previous call to `registerSubtypes`, it was testing overriding a `@JsonTypeName` annotation.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what to do about duplicates, I think option 2 feels more intuitive, however I think right now option 1 is the better option. I think this because that's the current behavior today and because of how caching works. When `SerializerProvider::findTypedValueSerializer` is called it will cache the created Serializer by class. Next time `SerializerProvider::findTypedValueSerializer` is called it will just pull from this cache instead of creating a new Serializer. Therefore once you serialize a class once, all subsequent calls to `registerSubtypes` with that class will be ignored with respect to Serialization. Changing this behavior is a much more involved change IMO.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/546189743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2742924143,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3NDI5MjQxNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2742924143","actor":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d4e52ec098c555f3ac36f7e9065680b09b2f2b1a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jkosh44/jackson-databind/commits/d4e52ec098c555f3ac36f7e9065680b09b2f2b1a","created_at":"2019-10-25T04:43:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2742930782,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3NDI5MzA3ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2742930782","actor":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c06e13203c6fb28133f142ac70274fad304a4229","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jkosh44/jackson-databind/commits/c06e13203c6fb28133f142ac70274fad304a4229","created_at":"2019-10-25T04:48:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2742935120,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3NDI5MzUxMjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2742935120","actor":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"pub

this commit NamedType hashes only on it's class and not on the\r\nname. This only allowed you to register a class once using\r\nObjectMapper.registerSubtypes(NamedType... types). This commit now\r\nuses name field to hash NamedTypes.\r\n\r\nThis successfully allows you to deserialize objects of the same type\r\nbut different name.\r\n\r\nSerializing objects of the same type but different name (for example\r\nfields of a POJO) still has some issues.\r\n1. SerializerProvider caches Serializers based on class and doesn't\r\ntake name into account.\r\n2. TypeIdResolver has no method to resolve an id that takes name into\r\naccount. Therefore when resolving an id we only have the value and\r\ntype.\r\n3. TypeNameIdResolver stores type and id information as a\r\nMap<String, String> that maps type to id, ignoring name\r\n\r\nFixes #2515","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2523/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/546474792","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2515#issuecomment-546474792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2515","id":546474792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjQ3NDc5Mg==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T19:04:12Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T19:04:12Z","body":"I may not have explained (2) properly: I do not mean that you would be able to change definitions, but rather that in case of multiple calls during initialization phase, this would be checked.\r\nGiven that type mappings may be registered via modules and so on, it is not necessarily rare for multiple registrations to be called.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, both options are possible and about as easy to implement.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/546474792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
