For example, the following code runs fine on 2.6.1:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nreturnType = \"java.util.List\";\r\nobjectMapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical(returnType);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in version `2.8.7`, the same code gives a `NullPointerException` with the stack trace:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.rmi.RemoteException: java.lang.NullPointerException:null. \r\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.TypeFactory._fromVariable(TypeFactory.java:1421)\r\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.TypeFactory._fromAny(TypeFactory.java:1182)\r\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.TypeFactory._fromParamType(TypeFactory.java:1404)\r\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.TypeFactory._fromAny(TypeFactory.java:1172)\r\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.TypeFactory._resolveSuperInterfaces(TypeFactory.java:1318)\r\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.TypeFactory._fromClass(TypeFactory.java:1261)\r\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.TypeParser.parseType(TypeParser.java:60)\r\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.TypeParser.parse(TypeParser.java:33)\r\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.TypeFactory.constructFromCanonical(TypeFactory.java:544)\r\n    at foo.company.package.serialize.Serializer.deserialize(Serializer.java:355)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if the `returnType` string is passed with the generic type information, even if it is passed as `Object`, ie, `returnType = \"java.util.List<java.lang.Object>\";`, it works fine.\r\n\r\nI have 2 questions, is there a way to make this change backward compatible? If not, how can I work around this? PS: The workaround given by Tatu in the mailing list is not clear to *me*, if someone can give me an example, it'd be great help.
