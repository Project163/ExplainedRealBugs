This is concerning because usages of the library could start exposing sensitive data that it wasn't in previous versions and this would be unknowingly.  Since this is a minor (2.14 -> 2.15) this seems to be a big change that should be saved for a major.\r\n\r\nI did verify mapper.isEnabled(MapperFeature.PROPAGATE_TRANSIENT_MARKER) is false in both 2.14 and 2.15, but it seems to be working in 2.14 without needing to set it to
