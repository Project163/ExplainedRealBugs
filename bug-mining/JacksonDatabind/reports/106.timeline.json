serialisation of Joda `DateTime` instances behaves differently in 2.6.0 vs 2.5.4 when the `ObjectMapper`'s had its `DateFormat` configured. The behaviour change is illustrated by the following code:\n\n``` java\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\n    System.out.println(createObjectMapper()\n            .writeValueAsString(new DateTime(1988, 6, 25, 20, 30, DateTimeZone.UTC)));\n}\n\nprivate static ObjectMapper createObjectMapper() {\n    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n    mapper.registerModule(createJodaModule());\n    mapper.configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS, false);\n    System.out.println(mapper.getSerializationConfig().getTimeZone());\n    mapper.setDateFormat(new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\"));\n    System.out.println(mapper.getSerializationConfig().getTimeZone());\n    return mapper;\n}\n\nprivate static SimpleModule createJodaModule() {\n    SimpleModule module = new SimpleModule();\n    module.addSerializer(DateTime.class, new DateTimeSerializer(\n            new JacksonJodaDateFormat(DateTimeFormat.forPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\")\n                    .withZoneUTC())));\n        return module;\n    }\n```\n\nWhen run with Jackson 2.5.4 the output is:\n\n```\nsun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id=\"GMT\",offset=0,dstSavings=0,useDaylight=false,transitions=0,lastRule=null]\nsun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id=\"GMT\",offset=0,dstSavings=0,useDaylight=false,transitions=0,lastRule=null]\n\"1988-06-25 20:30:00\"\n```\n\nWhen run with Jackson 2.6.0 the output is:\n\n```\nsun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id=\"GMT\",offset=0,dstSavings=0,useDaylight=false,transitions=0,lastRule=null]\nsun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id=\"Europe/London\",offset=0,dstSavings=3600000,useDaylight=true,transitions=242,lastRule=java.util.SimpleTimeZone[id=Europe/London,offset=0,dstSavings=3600000,useDaylight=true,startYear=0,startMode=2,startMonth=2,startDay=-1,startDayOfWeek=1,startTime=3600000,startTimeMode=2,endMode=2,endMonth=9,endDay=-1,endDayOfWeek=1,endTime=3600000,endTimeMode=2]]\n\"1988-06-25 21:30:00\"\n```\n\nIt looks like the fix for #824 is the cause. In 2.6, the call to `mapper.setDateFormat` causes the `ObjectMapper`'s time zone to be set to the JVM's default time zone. In 2.5.x, calling `mapper.setDateFormat` has no effect on its time zone.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/889/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
