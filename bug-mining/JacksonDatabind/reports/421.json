But it seems sub-optimal as behavior, and something to definitely change for 3.0... but probably also for 2.10.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple things we could do.\r\n\r\n1. Change it back to 2.8, to return `NullNode`\r\n2. Change to throw exception, as \"not valid\" use case\r\n3. Change it to return `MissingNode`\r\n4. Leave as-is, for rest of 2.x.\r\n\r\nAlthough it might seem best to revert it to (1), that seems somewhat wrong, problematic, as it would now not be possible to distinguish between JSON `null` value and missing content.\r\nAnd although (2) would probably make sense, if designing API from scratch, it is probably too intrusive.\r\n\r\nSo I think (3) is the best way: it avoids returning `null` or throwing Exception (both being likely to break 2.9 code), but still allows distinguishing between all possible input cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2211/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
