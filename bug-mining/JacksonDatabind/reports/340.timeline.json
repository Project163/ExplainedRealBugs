the JSON value is numeric, `TreeTraversingParser` silently overflows. Maybe this is expected behavior, but to me the inconsistency between reading from a non-tree (reader/string/file, etc) versus directly from a tree seems like a bug. At the very least, it makes it less convenient to do manipulations on a JSON document before binding.\r\n\r\nI would expect an exception thrown for the all but the first three examples above, but I do understand there are use-cases for coercing values. Even so, I would expect the coercion logic to be \r\n- consistent between the parsers (or clearly documented otherwise)\r\n- consistent between quoted and unquoted values\r\n\r\nI'm also curious about the expected behavior when converting non-integral values. Why is `true` `MismatchedInput`, but `0.1` is converted? Similarly, why are `0.1`, `1e4`, and `1e-1` acceptable, but not when in quotes, even though `\"10\"` and other quote integers are acceptable? \r\n\r\nThanks for all your hard work on this. I hope this issue doesn't come off as condescending. For our specific use case, we read the value as a tree, validating it against a schema, then using Jackson to bind the tree to an object. While it's true that we can specify type, minimum, and maximum values in the schema, it is prone to mistakes, and there's not necessarily a reason to tie the schema to the language implementation, provided things like overflow consistently result in an exception. Thus, I'm trying to better understand the expectations and limits Jackson has when using the tree parser.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2189/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
