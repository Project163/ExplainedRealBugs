Looking at the code, it looks like it's because the custom format isn't actually added to `SqlDateSerializer` except in the `createContextual` method (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ser/std/DateTimeSerializerBase.java#L59).\r\n\r\nFor now, I've reverted this behavior with \r\n```\r\nmapper.registerModule(new SimpleModule() {\r\n            {\r\n                addSerializer(\r\n                        java.sql.Date.class,\r\n                        new SqlDateSerializer().withFormat(false, new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd\"))\r\n                );\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n```\r\nbut it seems pretty hacky so I'd prefer the other method if possible. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2064/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
