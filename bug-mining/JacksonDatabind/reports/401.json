This means that I can successfully deserialize a target property of\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap<String, ? extends Object> miscProperties;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the results being objects of basic types. So far so good.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I instead I use `Serializable` as the generic bound, Jackson complains that\r\n\r\n```\r\nCan not construct instance of java.io.Serializable: abstract types either need to be mapped to concrete types, have custom deserializer, or contain additional type information\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile in the case of general type resolution I understand the rationale for what's going on here, in practice every single type that Jackson will produce when faced with a deserialization into `Object` _is_ `Serializable`, and it should treat a target of `Serializable` identically to a target of `Object`.\r\n\r\nI am using 2.8.11.2.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
