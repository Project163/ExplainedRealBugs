module too.\r\n\r\nThis issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2273\r\n\r\ncan show what is needed; basic addition would be:\r\n\r\n1. Add `src/moditect/module-info.java` with dependency definitions (see Joda module's file, f.ex: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/blob/2.12/src/moditect/module-info.java )\r\n2. Add plugin invocation in `pom.xml` (see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/blob/2.12/pom.xml#L106 )\r\n\r\nwith appropriate modifications -- mostly, need to know Kotlin core module's
