using the latest Spring fox build, 2.0. It's working out great except two main issues,\n\n1) I'm not able to set a field as read-only. Here is what I've tried,\n   a)  JSON way - set ignore (@JsonIgnore) for the field (and setter) and use @JsonProperty in the getter.\n    b) Using hidden annotation - I went through the https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/554 and enabled readOnly in the ApiModelProperty.\n\n```\n    @OneToOne\n@JoinColumn(name = \"search_id\")\n@JsonIgnore\n@ApiModelProperty(value = \"xxx\", readOnly = true)\nprivate Search lastSearch;\n\n    @JsonProperty   \npublic Search getLastSearch() {\n    return lastSearch;\n}\n\n@JsonIgnore\npublic void setLastSearch(Search lastSearch) {\n    this.lastSearch = lastSearch;\n}\n```\n\n, where Search is a referenced object, which can't be set by use, but used only to show results.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n2) I'm not sure how do I set default value for a field.
