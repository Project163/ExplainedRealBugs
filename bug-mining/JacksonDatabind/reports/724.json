See #4364. I would like to know whether this is intended, and if it is, how I should migrate my code.\r\n\r\nWe have a custom XML annotation introspector which explicitly sets the wrapper name to `Property.NO_NAME` if our custom annotation is present and the type is a list:\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public PropertyName findWrapperName(Annotated ann) {\r\n        if (ann.hasAnnotation(RosettaAttribute.class) && hasCollectionType(ann)) {\r\n            // Disable wrapping of lists.\r\n            return PropertyName.NO_NAME;\r\n        }\r\n        return super.findWrapperName(ann);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis used to work in Jackson 2.15.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to the change in #4364, `PropertyName.NO_NAME` is now merged with `PropertyName.DEFAULT` from the default Jackson XML annotation introspector, and the new behaviour prefers `PropertyName.DEFAULT` over `PropertyName.NO_NAME`. The previous behaviour would prefer `PropertyName.NO_NAME`.\r\n\r\nI have not found a way to fix this. Is there a way to get rid of the default annotation processor?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @SimonCockx in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4364#issuecomment-2182307781_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
