This is somewhat interesting.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I think that `SimpleModule` actually is registered, despite id not showing.\r\nAs to why id is not included, things get bit more complicated: this is a combination of two different things.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is feature `MapperFeature.IGNORE_DUPLICATE_MODULE_REGISTRATIONS` (enabled by default) that is to prevent duplicate registration of a module. Since it is unlikely to be useful for `SimpleModule`, it is designed in a way so as not to apply to basic `SimpleModule` (but to apply to sub-classes).\r\nThis, in turn, is implemented by `SimpleModule` returning `null` from `getTypeId()` (unless sub-classed).\r\nEnd result then is that no type id is included in list of registered module type ids returned by `getRegisteredModuleIds()`.\r\n\r\nI will add a note on Javadoc of `getRegisteredModuleIds()` to mention this, but am not quite sure what else could be done -- there is the challenge of avoiding unintended prevention of registering multiple instances.\r\nOne minor improvement could be to make sure that if user specifies explicit `name` in constructor, that would be used as non-null \"type id\". I'll consider this issue to be about doing just that, but I am open to other ideas as well.\r\n\r\nIn your case you can sub-class `SimpleModule` if you want, and this should give it distinct type id that would get included.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/817159605/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4577629791,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NDU3NzYyOTc5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/4577629791","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-10T16:09:21Z","rename":{"from":"Jackson

Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n\nI think the changes made for https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3110 have resulted in some unintended behavior.   \n\nSpecifically, the `new SimpleModule(Version)` constructor calls `this(version.getArtifactId(), version);` which sets `_hasExplicitName = true` even though no explicit name was passed in.  And since `getArtifactId()` returns `\"\"` instead of `null`, this results in `getTypeId()` returning the same `\"\"` for distinct modules.  \n\nI think either `_hasExplicitName` name should not be set to true when it is not explicitly passed in, or `_name` should be set to null if `getArtifactId()` returns empty string.    The former is probably easier since there validation in ObjectMapper to ensure `getModuleName()` is not null, although it doesn't really seem correct to implicitly set name to an empty string - especially when it can also result in `getTypeId()` being an empty string. \n\nHere is a simple test case:\n\n```\n  public class Module1 extends SimpleModule {\n        public Module1() {\n            super(Version.unknownVersion());\n        }\n    };\n    \n    public class Module2 extends SimpleModule {\n        public Module2() {\n            super(Version.unknownVersion());\n        }\n    };\n    \n    @Test\n    public void test() {\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n        mapper.registerModule(new Module1());\n        mapper.registerModule(new Module2());\n        Set<Object> modules = mapper.getRegisteredModuleIds();\n        Assert.assertEquals(2, modules.size());\n    }\n```\n\n\n### Version Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Reproduction\n\n<-- Any of the following\n1.
