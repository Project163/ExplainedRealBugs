Constructing `JsonParser` out of `JsonNode` (method `traverse()`)\r\n2. Either locating deserializer to use (`find[Non]ContextualValueDeserializer()`) and calling it; or using short-cut of `readValue()` (or readPropertyValue()`)\r\n\r\nBecause of this, many users instead use construct like:\r\n\r\n    JsonNode tree = ctxt.readTree(p);\r\n    MyPojo value = ctxt.getCodec(). treeToValue(tree.get(\"pojo\"), MyPojo.class);\r\n\r\nwhich has been available since Jackson 2.0, but has some issue regarding not retaining current deserialization context and things like Attributes set.\r\n\r\nSo it would make sense to add a convenience method that does what is intended starting with existing `JsonNode` (first checking for `null` and \"missing node\"?), locating deserializer & reading.\r\nNaming TBD, could be:\r\n\r\n    DeserializationContext.treeToValue(JsonNode, Class<?> targetType); // and other method with `JavaType`\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
