If a parsing problem occurs (invalid JSON), JsonParseException will be thrown. **If no content is found from input (end-of-input), Java null will be returned**.\n\nBut if I try to use it with an empty file (through the `FileInputStream`) I get the following exception:\n\n> com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: No content to map due to end-of-input\n\nI was wondering whether it is the code not to be aligned with the expected behavior or it is just the Javadoc.\n\nIdeally, from a consumer prospective, it would have been nice to return a sort of \"identity\" `JsonNode` (e.g. an empty `JsonNodeType.OBJECT` or a `JsonNodeType.MISSING`) in case of empty file, stream, etc. But I can imagine that such a change (if it even makes sense) could cause some backward compatibility issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
