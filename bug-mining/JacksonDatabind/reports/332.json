It seems like the old one could have been deprecated instead of the hard break. \r\n\r\nI'm using Finatra for my API layer, and it handles a lot of request object de/serialization using Jackson. I'd like to upgrade to 2.9.2, but currently can't because Finatra attempts to create an instance of ValueInjector using the old constructor (https://github.com/twitter/finatra/blob/develop/jackson/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finatra/json/internal/caseclass/utils/FieldInjection.scala#L50). It seemed better to open the issue here because I don't think Finatra should have to lock users to 2.9+.
