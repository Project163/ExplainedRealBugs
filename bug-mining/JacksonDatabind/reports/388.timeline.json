 The issue is `StdValueInstantiator` and is hard to reproduce in Java because the default constructor is called and then values are set after at which point they have the correct type.  But if a value instantiator is in play, then this code will break:\n\n```\n @Override public Object createFromObjectWith(DeserializationContext ctxt,\n            SettableBeanProperty[] props, PropertyValueBuffer buffer) {\n   Object[] jsonParmValueList = buffer.getParameters(props)\n   super.createFromObjectWith(ctxt, jsonParmValueList)\n}\n```\n\nand looking at the `Object[]` of parameters received it is because the enum comes as type `String` and not as an enum type.  Whereas if this is set via a property (in @rocketraman  attempt to reproduce in Java) then it comes as the enum type which doesn't crash.\n\nSo something in the `PropertyValueBuffer` class does not know what type to coerce the value into... \n\nLooking at the method signature again...  the `SettableBeanProperty[] props` parameter should have the properties with their correct types, right?    And it does, I have 2 properties that come in as:\n\n```\n[simple type, class com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.test.GithubDatabind1328$InviteKind]\n[simple type, class com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.test.GithubDatabind1328$InviteTo]\n```\n\nGreat, those are correct.  So why then does `buffer.getParameters(props)` return:\n\n```\n[0]  \"CONTACT\" as String\n[1]   InviteToContact(name=Foo) as InviteToContact\n```\n\nTherefore `buffer.getParameters` in databind does not coerce the string \"CONTACT\" into an `enum` as it should.  The issue lies there.  Not sure how in Java you can force the StdValueInstantiator to be used to reproduce this.
