Question then is, for existing legacy usage, which is worse:\n\n1. Continuing potentially risky usage, leading to potential breakage (likely hard to diagnose)\n2. Explicit breakage if these classes and constants are removed and Jackson dependency is upgraded\n\nArguably (1) is worse, as even new code could start using problematic classes, constants (when copy-pasting).\nAt the same time, SemVer would suggest we only remove these from Jackson 3.0 (from which they are removed, see `master`.\n\nI propose these classes, constants, would, however, be removed earlier than this, from Jackson 2.17. Please add comments on WDYT.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
