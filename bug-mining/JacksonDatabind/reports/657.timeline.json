thanks for sharing the migration article: I'm learning very interesting things about these 2 plugins, I'm starting to understand the story behind\r\n\r\nwhich leads to an answer on \"it sounds like neither Felix maven-bundle-plugin nor biz.aQute.bnd:bnd-maven-plugin automatically handle things the way we'd want, wrt specified timestamp.\r\nBut both could perhaps be improved to do so. Is my understanding correct?\"\r\n\r\ngood news: not exactly, the situation is better: the `bnd-maven-plugin` as used in the migration documentation will bring the updated timestamp in the jar file (because it uses `bnd-maven-plugin:bnd-process` goal only to generate manifests, and lets `jar:jar` do the jar, and `jar:jar` respects the configured timestamp)\r\n\r\nFelix `maven-bnd-plugin` does not respect the timestamp, because it delegates the jar creation to Bnd, which seems not to respect the timestamp from what we saw in your Jackson project. And I suppose `bnd-maven-plugin:jar` to do exactly the same\r\n\r\nSo the quick summary is: if you migrate Jackson to `bnd-maven-plugin` with packaging `jar` instead of `bundle` as described in the migration documentation, you should have the expected result: jars with updated timestamp\r\n\r\n(I learned many things these days, thanks a
