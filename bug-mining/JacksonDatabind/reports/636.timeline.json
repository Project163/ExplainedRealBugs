Interesting question -- does \"coercion\" mean forceful explicit change that is not allowed by default like in Java -- in which case Integral numbers can become Floating-point ones since there is no loss of accuracy (... except for possible overflow?) -- or should it also include this case?\r\n\r\nSo, the reason this is not checked is as per above: whereas conversion from integer number to floating point is likely dangerous, the reverse typical is not.\r\n\r\nBut I think it is not unreasonable to expect one could consider this a coercion too, something that can be prevented.\r\n\r\nSo

you'd like**\r\nImplement the handling for the following coercion configurations:\r\n\r\n- boolean to string coercion config: [Fail, TryConvert, AsNull, AsEmpty]\r\n- floating point number to string config: [Fail, TryConvert, AsNull, AsEmpty]\r\n\r\n**Usage example**\r\n\r\n```java\r\nObjectMapper mapper = new

the bug**\r\nExisting code which disables `MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS` unexpectedly impacted by #3509 / #3503 which added support for coercionconfig converting from integer-shaped data into float-shaped data. I agree that the ability to control such facets of coercion is fantastic, but I'm not sure that the feature should impact `MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS` for a case that can be considered a valid format in JSON (`1` vs `1.0`, I would argue both are valid representations of `(float) 1`).\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, I would use the new coercion configuration type, however this is not always possible due to cross-version compatibility requirements. Dependency resolution from 2.13.x to 2.14.0 will potentially cause deserialization to fail unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nWhich Jackson version(s) was this for?\r\n2.14.0-rc2, introduced in 2.14.0-rc1.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nIf you have a way to reproduce this with:\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a test which fails on the tip of 2.14.0, and passes with the proposed fix in the PR: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/pull/3625\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf reproduction itself needs further explanation, you may also add more details here.\r\n\r\nIdeally the semantics of `MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS` would not be modified by the introduction of support for configuring integer to float coercion. I would propose special-casting the behavior of `ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS`  to exclude failing int-to-float coercion, maintaining existing behavior.\r\n\r\nAny feedback you have is appreciated,

reported here: #3624\r\n\r\nExisting code which disables `MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS` unexpectedly impacted by #3509 / #3503 which added support for coercionconfig converting from integer-shaped data into float-shaped data. I agree that the ability to control such facets of coercion is fantastic, but I'm not sure that the feature should impact `MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS` for a case that can be considered a valid format in JSON (`1` vs `1.0`, I would argue both are valid representations of `(float) 1`).\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, I would use the new coercion configuration type, however this is not always possible due to cross-version compatibility requirements. Dependency resolution from 2.13.x to 2.14.0 will potentially cause deserialization to fail unexpectedly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3625/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12138664999,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c5K1sdgzwAAAALThVQn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/12138664999","actor":{"login":"moontide","id":1464560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjQ1NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1464560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide","html_url":"https://github.com/moontide","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moontide/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"86355cfb1b79e233039a88f618511135b140567e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moontide/jackson-databind/commits/86355cfb1b79e233039a88f618511135b140567e","created_at":"2024-03-16T05:32:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
