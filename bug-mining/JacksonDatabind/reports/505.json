all,\r\n\r\nOn Jackson 2.9.8(Also attempted with 2.10.0.pr3), when sending JSON of the type [JSON Request.txt](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/3675266/JSON.Request.txt):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n CustomerType: \"A\",\r\n \"Status\": 123\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe CustomerType is not enclosed in quotation marks and raises a JSONMappingException.\r\nThe exception raised has its column number one less than the actual location of the syntax error. \r\n\r\nFor example, in the JSON Request.txt, the column number in exception would be 1, when it actually should be 2.\r\n\r\nI've ran similar loads against Jackson 2.2.3 and this error did not happen then.\r\n[Typo JSON.txt](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/3675286/Typo.JSON.txt)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n \"CustomerTpe\": \"A\",\r\n \"Status\": 123\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn TypoJSON.txt, a JSONMappingException is also raised but the line number is accurate.(its 2)\r\n\r\nI did a little more digging into the code, \r\nJSONRequest.txt causes JSONParseException before it is converted to JSONMappingException\r\nTypoJSON.txt causes      UnRecognizedPropertyException before it is **cast** into JSONMappingException.\r\n\r\nUnRecognizedPropertyException inherits from JSONMappingException while JSONParseException does not.\r\n\r\nDuring the conversion process to JSONMappingException, JSONParseExcpetion's error location is overwritten by the JSONReader's location which is one line behind the actual syntax error.\r\n\r\nIf this is the intended behavior, please let me know.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
