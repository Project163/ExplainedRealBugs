I need to do bit more work on 2.5 to ensure other cases are not affected, since `Collection` caching was also extended. These are difficult ones to trouble-shoot, but knowing the problem it is easier to write proper tests now -- reproduction requires specific sequence of resolution calls (custom one first vs last).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/86993374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-27T18:32:56Z","updated_at":"2015-03-27T18:32:56Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/738","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/738/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/738/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/738/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/738","id":64822276,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDgyMjI3Ng==","number":738,"title":"@JsonTypeInfo

observing what appears to be a race condition in Jackson 2.5.1, where a particular use of `@JsonTypeInfo` will non-deterministically get ignored when writing JSON. I have a [small test case](https://github.com/dylanscott/jackson-race) which for me reproduces the issue 30-50% of the time. We're copying the structure of a type in our application, which looks like the following:\n\n```\n          HasSubTypes (interface)\n               |\n       AbstractHasSubTypes (uses @JsonTypeInfo and @JsonSubTypes, serializing as wrapper object)\n       /       |         \\\nTypeOne     TypeTwo     TypeThree\n```\n\nWe mixin `AbstractHasSubTypes`' annotations with `HasSubTypes`, and then serialize a `Wrapper` object which has a single field of type `HasSubTypes`. There appears to be a race condition when serializing these wrapper objects in parallel, where some percentage of the time the `@JsonTypeInfo` information is completely ignored and we don't serialize any type information. The linked test case should hopefully make this clearer, it's pretty small.

`com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.DeserializerCache#_createAndCacheValueDeserializer` within a `synchronized` block. The comment in that file explains that \"Only one thread to construct deserializers at any given point in time; limitations necessary to ensure that only completely initialized ones are visible and used\". In case the deserializer is not cachable, we do not need to lock the cache with the `synchronized` block; we can just create a new deserializer and return it. However, the code still creates a lock and calls `_createAndCache2`, which then checks whether the deserializer is cachable.\n\nSo, for a deserializer that is not cachable, the lock is created even though cache is not being updated, so no locking is needed.\n\nThe result of this is a multithreading lock contention for non-cachable deserializer. In scenarios where many threads are deserializing at once, this contention leads to severe degradation of performance.\n\nThis problem has been mitigated as of version 2.8.x by enabling more deserializers to be cached. However, if serializers are not cached (because they are custom serializers with complicated behavior), performance degradation due to unnecessary locking will still occur.\n\nPerhaps it is possible to rearrange the logic in `DeserializerCache#_createAndCache2` and `DeserializerCache#_createAndCacheValueDeserializer` so that non-cachable deserializers are created without a global lock.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1394/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
