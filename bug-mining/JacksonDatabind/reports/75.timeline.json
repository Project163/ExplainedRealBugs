Senaj](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mior)** opened **[SPR-12811](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-12811?redirect=false)** and commented\n\nIn Spring MVC I have following object hierarchy.\n\n```\n@JsonTypeInfo( use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, \n     include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, \n     property = \"type\") \npublic abstract class ParentClass {\n}\n```\n\n```\n@JsonTypeName(\"foo\") \npublic class Foo extends ParentClass {\n    private String person;\n}\n```\n\n```\n@JsonTypeName(\"bar\") \npublic class Bar extends ParentClass {\n    private String item;\n}\n```\n\n**ACTUAL:**\nWhen I generate response from method as List\\<ParentClass> it generates JSON without \"type\" : \"foo\" or \"type\" : \"bar\".\n\n```\n@ResponseBody\npublic List<ParentClass> method() {\n    List<ParentClass> result =  // generate classes foo and bar\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n```\n[{ \"person\" : \"John Doe\" }, { \"item\" : \"rifle\" }]\n```\n\n**EXPECTED:**\nIn List\\<T> response type it should generate \"type\" as well.\n\n```\n@ResponseBody\npublic List<ParentClass> method() {\n    List<ParentClass> result =  // generate classes foo and bar\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n```\n[{ \"type\" : \"foo\", \"person\" : \"John Doe\" }, { \"type\" : \"bar\", \"item\" : \"rifle\" }]\n```\n\n**TRIVIA:**\nWhen I return from `@Controller` in `@ResponseBody` object which contains List\\<ParentClass> as\n\n```\npublic class AnotherClass { \n    public List<ParentClass> values; \n}\n```\n\nIt generates proper response with proper \"type\" in it.\n\n```\n@ResponseBody\npublic AnotherClass method() {\n    AnotherClass result =  // generate Another class and list of foo and bar\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n```\n{ \"values\" :[\n     { \"type\" : \"foo\", \"person\" : \"John Doe\" }, \n     { \"type\" : \"bar\", \"item\" : \"rifle\" } ] \n}\n```\n\nSee also [stackoverflow issue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28990813/populate-object-type-in-springmvc-using-jacksonjson)\n\nWhat I found so far that in\norg.springframework.http.converter.json.AbstractJackson2HttpMessageConverter:228\nthis.objectMapper.writerWithView(serializationView).writeValue(generator, value);\n\nIs serializing data without its type and base on [this topic](http://www.studytrails.com/java/json/java-jackson-Serialization-list.jsp) it should have writerWithType in order to write type.\n\n---\n\n**Affects:** 4.1.1\n\n**Issue Links:**\n- #17752 Type aware canWrite() method should be called for GenericHttpMessageConverter\n- #17903 Jackson 2.6: message converter should use type only for collections\n- #18301 Revise AbstractJackson2HttpMessageConverter's generic type adaptation\n- #19776 HTTP Response should not contain both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers\n- #21006 GSON converter only serialises fields of controller method return type, ignoring subclass fields of response object\n- #18423 RequestPartMethodArgumentResolver should defensively handle MethodParameter nesting level and java.util.Optional access\n- #17745 Better parameterized type serialization for the request body in RestTemplate\n\n**Referenced from:** commits
