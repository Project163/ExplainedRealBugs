Search before asking\r\n\r\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nSerialization of java records do not appear to be honoring `@JsonProperty` names in `@JsonCreator` constructors. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n2.15.x+\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nA test below fails for me and I expect it to pass.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.Test;\r\n\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n\r\npublic class RecordTest {\r\n\r\n    public static final ObjectMapper OBJECT_MAPPER = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\r\n    public record TestObject(String testFieldName, Integer testOtherField) {\r\n\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        public TestObject(@JsonProperty (\"strField\") String testFieldName,\r\n                          @JsonProperty (\"intField\") Integer testOtherField) {\r\n            this.testFieldName = testFieldName;\r\n            this.testOtherField = testOtherField;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void test() throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n        final String result = OBJECT_MAPPER.writeValueAsString(new TestObject(\"test\", 1));\r\n        assertTrue(result.contains(\"strField\"));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe field is renamed to what is specified in the `@JsonProperty` annotation in the record's `@JsonCreator`\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nWe encountered this upgrading from 2.14.x up to 2.16.x, so this functionality was working at that earlier version (perhaps before records were really addressed). \r\n\r\nPerhaps we have versions incorrect between jackson modules and libraries, but we haven't found the exact mismatch yet.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
