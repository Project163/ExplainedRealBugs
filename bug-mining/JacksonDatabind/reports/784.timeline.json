related to #4958 but distinct)\n\nAs explained on https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-future-ideas/wiki/JSTEP-3 we want to improve and extend the set of non-numeric Scalar value accessors like `asBoolean()` for Jackson 3.0.\n\nAs of 2.x, there are a few accessors for types like, say, `boolean` or `String`:\n\n* `booleanValue()`: return `boolean` if (and only if!) we got actual Boolean node -- but won't throw exception, returns default value (`false`) otherwise\n* `asBoolean()`: same as `asBoolean(0)`\n* `asBoolean(boolean defaultValue`): return `boolean` value from JSON Boolean OR if coercible (from String`); otherwise return `defaultValue`\n\nBut none actually throws exception: partly due to historical reasons (was not done initially), and also since methods do not expose `JacksonException` (or `IOException`). So this limitation is due to backwards compatibility (for 2.x)\n\nSo there are a few things to improve for 3.0:\n\n1. Should allow throwing exceptions, for case where no default is specified. We can now do this more easily as we throw unchecked exception -- meaning accessors are still safe with Java 8 streaming\n    * Jackson 3.0 now has `JsonNodeException` to use\n2. Should allow use of Java 8 `Optional`, as that is useful for `stream()` operations\n\nThis would lead to bigger set of methods, once again for `boolean`:\n\n1. `booleanValue()` as before, return value if JSON Boolean -- but if not, throw exception\n2. `booleanValue(boolean defaultValue)` as `booleanValue()` except returns `defaultValue` instead of exception\n3. `booleanValueOpt()` similar to `booleanValue()` but returns `Optional<Boolean>`, either present (as per `intValue()`) or absent (instead of exception)\n4. `asBoolean()` similar to `booleanValue()` but allows coercion from Integral numbers (0 == `false`, anything else `true`) and `String`, as well as `null` But if not, throw exception\n5. `asBooleanOpt()` like `asBoolean()` but returns `Optional<Boolean>`, either present (as per `asBoolean()`) or absent (instead of exception)\n\nWe should also do the same for `String` (by default `stringValue()` only for JSON String; `asString()` for all scalar-types but not Objects/Arrays).\n\nNOTE:\n\nIn addition to set for `boolean` there's:\n\n* `stringValue()`, `asString()`\n\nAnd there are some partial accessors to handle too:\n\n* `binaryValue()`\n\nNOTE 2:\n\nThis issue does NOT tackle `asXxx()` variants -- there's #5003 for that.\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-06T04:43:01Z","updated_at":"2025-03-06T04:43:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4958","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4958/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4958/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4958/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4958","id":2839393213,"node_id":"I_kwDOAC5e2c6pPbO9","number":4958,"title":"Extend,

explained on https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-future-ideas/wiki/JSTEP-3 we want to improve and extend the set of Scalar value accessors like `asInt()` for Jackson 3.0.\n\nAs of 2.x, there are a few accessors for types like, say, `int`:\n\n* `intValue()`: return `int` if (and only if!) we got numeric node (`JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT` or `JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_FLOAT) -- but won't throw exception, returns default value (`0`) otherwise. Also: can lose accuracy for FP numbers with fractions\n* `intValue(int defaultValue)` -- `int` if coercible, `defaultValue` if not\n* `asInt()` -- adds coercions from some non-numeric types too\n \nBut none actually throws exception: partly due to historical reasons (was not done initially), and also since methods do not expose `JacksonException` (or `IOException`). So this limitation is due to backwards compatibility (for 2.x)\n\nSo there are a few things to improve for 3.0:\n\n1. Should allow throwing exceptions, for case where no default is specified. We can now do this more easily as we throw unchecked exception -- meaning accessors are still safe with Java 8 streaming\n    * Jackson 3.0 now has `JsonNodeException` to use\n2. Should allow use of Java 8 `Optional`, as that is useful for `stream()` operations\n\nThis would lead to bigger set of methods, once again for `int`:\n\n1. `intValue()` as before, return value if `JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT`, within Java `int` range AND has no fraction (if floating point value) -- but if not, throw exception\n2. `intValue(int defaultValue)` as `intValue()` except returns `defaultValue` instead of exception\n3. `intValueOpt()` similar to `intValue()` but returns `OptionalInt`, either present (as per `intValue()`) or absent (instead of exception)\n4. `asInt()` (or `asIntValue()`?) similar to `intValue()` but allows coercion from `double` and `String`, as well as `null` (and even Boolean?). But if not, throw exception\n5. `asIntOpt()` like `asInt()` but returns `OptionalInt`, either present (as per `asInt()`) or absent (instead of exception)\n\nWe will add/change similar methods for:\n\n1. \"long\": `longValue()`, `longValue(long defaultValue)`, `OptionalLong longValueOpt()`, `asLong()`\n2. \"double\": `doubleValue()`, `doubleValue(double defaultValue)`, `OptionalDouble doubleValueOpt()`, `asDouble()`\n3. \"decimal\" (for `BigDecimal`): `decimalValue()`, `decimalValue(BigDecimal defaultValue)`, `Optional<BigDecimal> decimalValueOpt()`, `asDecimal()`\n\nAnd we can consider additional accessors as well, but let's start with above.\n\nNOTE:\n\n* There are following partial sets for number access: need to be changed to throw on non-numbers and have range checks\n    * `bigIntegerValue()` -- same\n    *  `floatValue()`\n    * `shortValue()` -- same\n    * `numberValue()` -- same; needs to throw exception for non-numbers\n\nNOTE: \n\nThis issue does NOT yet add/change `JsonNode.asXxx()` but only (numeric) `JsonNode.xxxValue()` methods (and variants) -- there's #5003 for `asInt()` and such.\n\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4958/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16853174116,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAC5e2c6sa6IHzwAAAAPshwdk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/16853174116","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-19T02:59:13Z","rename":{"from":"Extend,

`asBinary()`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-26T01:36:57Z","updated_at":"2025-03-26T01:36:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/pull/5044","id":2939970756,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAC5e2c6Ps_MG","number":5044,"title":"Fix

Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn Spring Security, we have a green unit test that can be reduced to:\n```java\nJsonNode node = JsonMapper.builder().build().readTree(\"{\\\"username\\\":\\\"admin\\\",\\\"password\\\":null}\");\nassertThat(node.get(\"password\").textValue()).isNull();\n```\nLooks basic, when I read a null String, I get `null` as expected.\n\nWith Jackson 3, this use case seems broken with both `asString` and `stringValue`:\n - `node.get(\"password\").asString()` returns `\"\"` (empty string)\n - `node.get(\"password\").asString(null)` also returns `\"\"` (empty string)\n - `node.get(\"password\").stringValue()` fails with a `'NullNode' method `stringValue()` cannot convert value <null> to `java.lang.String`: value type not String`exception\n - `node.get(\"password\").stringValue(null)` return `null` but we can't use that as `\"{\\\"username\\\":\\\"admin\\\",\\\"password\\\":1}\"` would also return a `null` String.\n - `node.get(\"password\").asStringOpt()` returns an `Optional` of \"\" (`Optional` of empty string)\n\nI think the root issue here is not default value handling. The root issue here seems to be that on deserialization side, `null` is not considered as a valid value for JSON String, while in Jackson 2 it was and while in Jackson 3 serialization side it still is, as `writeValueAsString(new User(\"admin\", null))` write `{\"password\":null,\"username\":\"admin\"}` as expected.\n\nI would expect Jackson 3 to allow me to get nullable string values when expected without having to rely on default values that are applicable to a lot of other use case as explained above, so not usable here.\n\nThe behavior I would expect is that Jackson 3 deserialization consider `null` as a valid String value so with `\"{\\\"username\\\":\\\"admin\\\",\\\"password\\\":null}\"`:\n - `node.get(\"password\").asString()` would return `null` instead of `\"\"`\n - `node.get(\"password\").stringValue()` would return return `null` instead of `\"\"`\n  - `node.get(\"password\").asStringOpt()` would return an empty `Optional` instead of an `Optional` of \"\" (`Optional` of empty string)\n\n### Version Information\n\n3.0.0-rc8\n\n### Reproduction\n\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5283/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
