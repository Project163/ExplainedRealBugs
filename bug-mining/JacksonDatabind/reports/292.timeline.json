Maybe I should open another issue, but here is an interesting scenario...\r\nImagine I register a custom *serialiser* for `java.util.Date` (by means of a module for instance) instead of changing the date format itself on the mapper.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmapper.registerModule(\r\n\tnew SimpleModule().addSerializer(\r\n\t\tnew DateSerializer(\r\n\t\t\tBoolean.FALSE, \r\n\t\t\tnew SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy/MM/dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX\"))));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow suppose I annotate my pojo as follows:\r\n```\r\npublic class Pojo {\r\n   @JsonFormat(timezone=\"GMT+4\")\r\n   private Date date;\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe annotation doesn't change the format but only the timezone - so I expect my custom format will be used. It won't be the case unfortunately: the handling of the annotation is such that it reverts to the format specified on the mapper itself and will bypass my custom module entirely.\r\n\r\nSee what I mean

Since Jackson itself controls application (although custom (de)serializers can easily access these too), it can take care to make things work more reliably together, that's all.\r\nUse of `Module` may still make sense, although there's no real benefit wrt configuring date format: it may make sense as packaging unit for projects.\r\n\r\nNow: as to `DateFormat`... that will work ok with `Date` case, and it may well be what you want to use.\r\nIt is bit more limited just because it won't work with Joda Date or Java 8 date/time types: problem being that JDK's old `DateFormat` is ... not a very good API, and can not really be reused (due to multiple reasons) by Joda/Java 8. But since Jackson's Date support started before explicit support for either of those, I chose to just date `DateFormat`.\r\nIn retrospect, it might have made sense to instead just take String pattern -- and this is what `@JsonFormat` and config overrides do.

Thanks for the very detailed info.\r\n\r\nFor your background, we had to adapt the serialization/deserialization of `java.util.Date` slightly for the following reasons:\r\n- make sure dates have their timezone offset serialized with a column (`:`)  - i.e. the format `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX` - which is not the case by default. The primary reason is to guarantee interoperability with applications making use of Java8 Zoned/OffsetDateTime (and also other platforms like iOS)\r\n- Java8 is likely to send Time info with nano second precision. Joda can handle them - it drops the extra digits and keep only the millis.
