news: I fixed the problem with annotation propagation. One downside: I realized that the annotation placement to use must be bit different -- it has to be next to actual property, and not within definition next to `@JsonValue`, so:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate static class A {\r\n        // Needs to be here as this is the actual property through which access occurs\r\n\t@JsonFormat( shape = Shape.STRING )\r\n\tprivate final B b;\r\n\r\n\tpublic A( final String description, final B b ) {\r\n\t\tthis.description = description;\r\n\t\tthis.b = b;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate static class B {\r\n\t@JsonValue\r\n        // CANNOT be here, alas\r\n\tprivate final BigDecimal value;\r\n\r\n\tpublic B( final BigDecimal value ) {\r\n\t\tthis.value = value;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand with that, fix works. Supporting alternative placement would be nice but I am not sure how feasible it is -- conceptually that would be logical: annotation on `@JsonValue` property should probably be used same way as class annotation of `B` would be.\r\nThat may be worth filing as another RFE issue; but for now I'll close this particular issue as there was an actual fix either way.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/701102993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3822272689,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzgyMjI3MjY4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/3822272689","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"9c63a101bb516d313250b596dc851fc7949e2381","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/9c63a101bb516d313250b596dc851fc7949e2381","created_at":"2020-09-30T01:19:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4087938698,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDA4NzkzODY5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/4087938698","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-09T04:12:20Z","label":{"name":"to-evaluate","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
