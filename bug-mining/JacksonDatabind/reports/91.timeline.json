While class information for that value can be handled, same is not true for typing within contained structured type.\n\nThat is, at least not currently possible to support. Theoretically perhaps it would be possible to include generic type signature instead of raw class; although in this case even that would not be help, when `PolymorphicValueWrapper` is passed as object, so type erasure removes generic parameters as well.\n\nFrom user perspective, it may be possible to make this case work by using \"default typing\", in which case determination of whether type information is included is based on checking what kind of class we have. If applied to `java.lang.Object` (one of choices at least does include that), type information should be included.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/69598676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/69702759","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/676#issuecomment-69702759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/676","id":69702759,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NzAyNzU5","user":{"login":"lunaticare","id":947471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NzQ3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/947471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare","html_url":"https://github.com/lunaticare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunaticare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-13T06:53:35Z","updated_at":"2015-01-13T06:53:35Z","body":"Thank you, @cowtowncoder, for investigating the case.\n\nIn both cases serialization gives JSON with all necessary information, that is:\n\n``` json\n{\"value\":\n  {\"@class\":\"com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.test.JacksonPolymorphicDeSerFailTest$MapContainer\",\n  \"map\":\n    {\"DateValue\":\n      [\"java.util.Date\",123456]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if one tries to first call \n\n``` java\nObjectMapper.readValue(jsonStr, MapContainer.class)\n```\n\nhe'll get correct map values henceforth, no matter if he deserializes `MapContainer` or `PolymorphicValueWrapper`. On the other side, if one calls\n\n``` java\nObjectMapper.readValue(jsonStr, PolymorphicValueWrapper.class)\n```\n\n`MapContainer` values will always be deserialized as `ArrayList`.\n\nSo Jackson can do its job pretty good.
