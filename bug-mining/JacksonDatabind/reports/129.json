got an issue reported in my jackson-antpathfilter project that the filtering is not working correctly when it is used together with Jackson's convert feature: https://github.com/Antibrumm/jackson-antpathfilter/issues/2\n\nDuring the investigation i found out that the cause is that the writeContext is created differently and I am wondering if this is the desired behavior or if that's a bug for you.\n\nIn this comment (https://github.com/Antibrumm/jackson-antpathfilter/issues/2#issuecomment-145211847) I print out what is found in the writeContext and I have created a TestCase to reproduce the error. \n\nPlease let me know what you think.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/984/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
