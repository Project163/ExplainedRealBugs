(with a getter or field) and then modified with incoming data. If merging is not used assignment happens without considering current state.\r\n...\r\nFor [Collection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html?is-external=true) and Arrays, merging is done by appending incoming data into contents of existing Collection/array\r\n\r\nBut the error is that Jackson cannot find a deserializer for `MyList`. It doesn't need to because it can access the current value (with a getter or `@JsonProperty` as in this example) and modify it. Without `@JsonMerge`, the current state of the `values` field is not considered and so I expect exactly this kind of failure.\r\nPerhaps I misunderstood `@JsonMerge`, but the docs are quite clear I think.\r\n\r\nA workaround is possible via a custom setter:\r\n```java\r\nprivate void setMyList(List<Integer> ints) { ints.forEach(MyList::add); }\r\n```\r\nBut this \"pollutes\" the class and also requires `opens` declarations in `module-info` to be able to read the `private` setter.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n2.17 and

I managed to pinpoint it to [this](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4922) fix on Jackson Databind.\nWhat happens now when initializing form data in DefaultServerWebExchange ([code](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/server/adapter/DefaultServerWebExchange.java#L154)) is that JSON mappers also say they can read form data ([here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/server/adapter/DefaultServerWebExchange.java#L200-L204)) and parsing therefore fails (because they can't).\nBefore this Jackson fix, ObjectMapper answered that it couldn't deserialize MultiValueMap.\n\n## Bug reproduce\nHere is the simplest dummy app I've managed to build which replicates the issue: [https://github.com/Dodomix/form-data-jackson-bug](https://github.com/Dodomix/form-data-jackson-bug). The test fails with version 3.4.4 of Spring Boot, and passes with 3.4.3 (change in Jackson 2.18.2 -> 2.18.3). I'm opening the report here because the problematic code is in spring-web.\n\nThe exact behavior which changed in Jackson:\n```\nvar objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\nobjectMapper.canDeserialize(objectMapper.constructType(MultiValueMap.class));\n```\n\n## Expected behavior\nAll tests pass.\n\n## System info\nJava: Temurin

have affected the construction of the map.\nAlso, declaring `Map<Integer, String> map = MapUtils.createMyMap();` instead also works, but the whole point is to merge to an initialized custom type. It shows that the containing class construction is valid, however.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No

MergeMap.class);\n\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\" == checking --\");\n\n\t\tSystem.out.println(merge2);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThe mapper configuration `(MapperFeature.ALLOW_FINAL_FIELDS_AS_MUTATORS, false)` changed its behavior and it's unclear which is correct.\n\nIn 2.18.2 the code above fails regardless of if `ALLOW_FINAL_FIELDS_AS_MUTATORS` is configured (and `@JsonMerge` doesn't help). It throws the following exception on deserialization:\n```\ncreator for MapImpl\ngetMap\n{3=ADS}\n == serializing --\ngetMap\n{\"map\":{\"3\":\"ADS\"}}\n == deserializing --\ncreator for MapImpl\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: Cannot construct instance of `example.MyMap` (no Creators, like default constructor, exist): no default constructor found\n at [Source: (String)\"{\"map\":{\"3\":\"ADS\"}}\"; line: 1, column: 8] (through reference chain: example.MergeMap[\"map\"])\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException.from(InvalidDefinitionException.java:67)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext.reportBadDefinition(DeserializationContext.java:1888)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DatabindContext.reportBadDefinition(DatabindContext.java:414)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext.handleMissingInstantiator(DeserializationContext.java:1375)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.MapDeserializer.deserialize(MapDeserializer.java:439)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.MapDeserializer.deserialize(MapDeserializer.java:32)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.impl.FieldProperty.deserializeAndSet(FieldProperty.java:138)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer.vanillaDeserialize(BeanDeserializer.java:310)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer.deserialize(BeanDeserializer.java:177)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.DefaultDeserializationContext.readRootValue(DefaultDeserializationContext.java:342)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper._readMapAndClose(ObjectMapper.java:4931)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.readValue(ObjectMapper.java:3868)\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.readValue(ObjectMapper.java:3836)\n\tat example.MergeMap.main(MergeMap.java:67)\n```\n \nIn 2.18.3 and above it fails with `ALLOW_FINAL_FIELDS_AS_MUTATORS` commented out (=true) and passes with it set to false (without `@JsonMerge`):\n```\ncreator for MapImpl\ngetMap\n{3=ADS}\n == serializing --\ngetMap\n{\"map\":{\"3\":\"ADS\"}}\n == deserializing --\ncreator for MapImpl\ngetMap\n == checking --\n{3=ADS}\n```\nWith `@JsonMerge` it always passes.\n\nThis is probably because of https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4922. However, the behavioral change is seen without `@JsonMerge`: include `configure(MapperFeature.ALLOW_FINAL_FIELDS_AS_MUTATORS, false)` and switch between 2.18.2. and 2.18.3.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
