\nthank you for share a awesome library.\n\nI am using version 2.6.7.\nHere is failed test which shows that `@JsonFormat` is ignored `pattern` attribute.\n\n``` java\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonFormat;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport java.sql.Date;\nimport static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n\npublic class JsonFormatTest {\n\n    public class Person {\n        @JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.STRING, pattern = \"yyyy.mm.dd\")\n        public Date dateOfBirth;\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void JsonFormatPatternTest() throws JsonProcessingException {\n        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n        Person i = new Person();\n        i.dateOfBirth = Date.valueOf(\"1980-04-14\");\n        assertEquals(\"{\\\"dateOfBirth\\\":\\\"1980.04.14\\\"}\", objectMapper.writeValueAsString(i));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the results of running the test:\n\n```\norg.junit.ComparisonFailure: \nExpected :{\"dateOfBirth\":\"1980.04.14\"}\nActual   :{\"dateOfBirth\":\"1980-04-14\"}\n```\n\nI don't know exactly the reason.\nBut I have a doubt in a line of code.\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.6/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ser/std/SqlDateSerializer.java#L36\n\nWhich method ignored the `customFormat` param.\n\nThank
