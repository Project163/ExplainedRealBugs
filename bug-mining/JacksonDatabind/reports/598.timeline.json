unsure whether this is a bug or expected behavior, but I found it a bit surprising. Given the following class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Key {\r\n\r\n    private final String value;\r\n\r\n    private Key(final String value) {\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @JsonCreator(mode = JsonCreator.Mode.DELEGATING)\r\n    public static Key of(final String value) {\r\n        return new Key(value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, when a `Key` value is deserialized, the factory method annotated with `@JsonCreator` is called as expected.  If `Key` is used as a key in a `Map` though, the factory method is not called and Key's private constructor is used directly instead. \r\n\r\n`Key` is of course reduced to demonstrate the issue and hence lacking all properties that would make it actually useful as a key in a map.\r\n\r\nI tried the above with version 2.9.7.
