Problem:\r\nStarting in version 9.4.3, Jetty's default cookie compliance behavior changed to adhere to the more strict RFC6265 standard which no longer allows for special characters to be included in a cookie value if it is enclosed within double quotes (which was allowed under RFC2109 and RFC2965). In some legacy use cases, the old cookie behavior is needed for the application to behave correctly. \r\n\r\nMore Context: https://webtide.com/jetty-cookies-and-rfc6265-compliance/\r\n\r\n###### Solution:\r\nJetty allows for the old cookie compliance behavior to be configured for requests or responses via the `HttpConfiguration` object. Dropwizard's `HttpConnectorFactory` can be updated to allow for configuring the legacy cookie compliance behavior.\r\n\r\n###### Result:\r\nDropwizard allows for configuring the request and response cookie compliance behavior for Jetty via the `requestCookieCompliance` and `responseCookieCompliance` fields of the `HttpConnectorFactory`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2812/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pstackle","id":1641826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDE4MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle","html_url":"https://github.com/pstackle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pstackle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-22T08:45:19Z","updated_at":"2019-06-22T08:45:19Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2783","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2783/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2783/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2783/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2783","id":450136647,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTAxMzY2NDc=","number":2783,"title":"jackson-databind
