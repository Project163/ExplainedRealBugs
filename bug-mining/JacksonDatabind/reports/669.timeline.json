I mean, if there was no existing `fields()` method, protection against modifications would be sensible but since we are not opening more holes, adding more protection won't help. Unless we retrofitted `fields()`; and doing that might even break existing \"working\" usage -- would not be surprised if some developers considered mutability via Iterator a Feature, not bug. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1464446730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1464460544","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3809#issuecomment-1464460544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3809","id":1464460544,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c5XSeUA","user":{"login":"pjfanning","id":11783444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgzNDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11783444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning","html_url":"https://github.com/pjfanning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-10T20:55:27Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T20:55:27Z","body":"I like immutable myself but Java users can't be weaned off mutable side effect laden coding.

change allows using the much more elegant for-each constructs:\r\n```\r\nfor(Map.Entry<String, JsonNode> enry : objectNode.fieldSet())\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\nfor(String field : objectNode.fieldNamesSet())\r\n```\r\nin addition to the current iterator-based access, which is more code intensive:\r\n```\r\nIterator<String> fieldNameIterator = objectNode.fieldNames();\r\nwhile(fieldNameIterator.hasNext()) {\r\n  String fieldName = fieldNameIterator.next();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\nIterator<Map.Entry<String, JsonNode>> entryIterator = objectNode.fields();\r\nwhile(entryIterator.hasNext()) {\r\n  Map.Entry<String, JsonNode> entry = entryIterator.next();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: This also needs an addition to TreeNode in jackson-core, to add this interface method:\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Method for accessing names of all fields for this node, iff\r\n     * this node is an Object node. Number of field names accessible\r\n     * will be {@link #size}.\r\n     */\r\n    Set<String> fieldNamesSet();\r\n```\r\nor the `@Override` needs to be removed from this method in `JsonNode`.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion (you may want to consider this for version 3?), the `Iterator` based methods should be replaced with `Iterable` methods completely. I.e. if API breaking changes are acceptable, I would make `fields()` return an `Iterable<Map.Entry<String, JsonNode>>` rather than an iterator, as `.fieldNames().iterator()` is exactly equivalent; and `fieldNames()` return `Iterable<String>` rather than an iterator for the same reason. Java allows foreach loops for `Iterable`, but not for `Iterator`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1590/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14794527009,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c5f_SrYzwAAAANx0pEh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/14794527009","actor":{"login":"ggrebert","id":1737774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mzc3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1737774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert","html_url":"https://github.com/ggrebert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a3ded7bad2ceee17cf410422b70ecffb6191394b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ggrebert/jackson-databind/commits/a3ded7bad2ceee17cf410422b70ecffb6191394b","created_at":"2024-10-22T23:37:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
