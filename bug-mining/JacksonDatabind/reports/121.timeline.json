So, the problem here is due to the fact that at root-level, an `EnumMap` value does not have generic type information, and key type can not be detected before actual serialization. As a result, a `StdKeySerializer` is used, and while it knows how to handle some basic types, for most (including all `Enum`s), it simply calls `toString()`.\n\nThere are couple of ways to solve the issue. One would require `MapSerializer` to detect this, and try to find a better key serializer as needed. Since implementation is already complicated, this is not ideal.\nOn the other hand, maybe `StdKeySerializer` could be improved to be able to lookup proper serializer for Enum key. Alas, while there is `EnumSerializer` that works fine, there is no matching key serializer; and problem is that low-level write call to make is different.\nSo maybe there needs to be `EnumKeySerializer` to use.\n\nAnyway, there are ways to solve this, but fix is somewhat more involved than I was hoping for, so it'll take bit longer.\n\nIn the mean time, the usual work-arounds for type erasure would allow working around the problem.\nSo, for example, using something like:\n\n``` java\nclass EnumXMap<V> extends EnumMap<EnumX, V> { }\n```\n\nshould let enum of type `EnumX` be detected and work as expected.\nSimilarly `ObjectWriter` allows definition of root value type with\n\n```\nObjectWriter w = mapper.writerFor(new TypeReference<EnumMap<MyEnum, ValueType>>()  {});\n```\n\nWhile not ideal, one of these approaches should work to get things going until fix is available.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/91043273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"tm2git","id":5580916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODA5MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5580916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git","html_url":"https://github.com/tm2git","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2git/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-22T02:21:30Z","updated_at":"2015-04-22T02:21:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/765","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/765/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/765/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/765/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/765","id":70001367,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MDAwMTM2Nw==","number":765,"title":"Is

It's not a good reason, but it did not seem like a major limitation for most uses, esp. at the time, and since Map-valued properties are usually (fully) typed.\n\nNow: in specific case of `Enum`s, it may be easier to get root-level \"untyped\" Maps to still work as expected, wrt values. For serialization I think default handling would be to call `toString()` anyway, if that helps.\n\nBut like I said, I haven't re-read code to see how much of `Enum` magic might be supported even via \"std\" key deserializer.\n\nOne other possible work-around idea is that if you can use Map sub-classes that preserve generic declarations -- like, say, `public class MyEnumStringMap extends HashMap<MyEnum,String>`, it will not lose type information, even for root-values.

It seems reasonable to, for example, add logic to at least handle `Enum` keys dynamically, locating whatever key serializer is needed.\nAnd as to caching. that should not be too problematic either. This is solved dynamically for value serializers for many structured types, using local caching, and not requiring centralized caching.\n\nSo I think this is actually quite solvable now I am thinking

have a module that extends simple model to allow us to accept enum names in lower case in a fairly generic manner\r\nInside that we add the `modifyKeyDeserializer`\r\n\r\nThe incoming class (using immutables) is mapped to a guava immutable map.\r\nWalking through the code:\r\n\r\n> com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.guava.deser.ImmutableMapDeserializer.createContextual\r\n>  calls DeserializationContext.findKeyDeserializer\r\n>  calls DeserializerCache.findKeyDeserializer\r\n>  calls BasicDeserializerFactory.createKeyDeserializer\r\n\r\nwhich has the code:\r\n```java\r\n        // the only non-standard thing is this:\r\n        if (deser == null) {\r\n            if (type.isEnumType()) {\r\n                return _createEnumKeyDeserializer(ctxt, type);\r\n            }\r\n            deser = StdKeyDeserializers.findStringBasedKeyDeserializer(config, type);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we are an enum type, it returns the value in the `_createEnumKeyDeserializer`, which is the standard enum deserializer.\r\nBelow that block is the check for the hasDeserializerModifiers, but since we have returned already, it is never called, so we can't override the behaviour.\r\n\r\nModule fragment:\r\n```java\r\n    setDeserializerModifier(new BeanDeserializerModifier() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\r\n
