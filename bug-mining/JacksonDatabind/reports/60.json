This makes it unnecessary difficult to implement a DefaultTyping where not all types need type information.\n\nIn my case only objects should have type information, arrays and scalars should not be touched. The `IdResolver` could handle this already, by checking the `value` in the `idForValue..` method, but the TypeSerializer will fail in case the resolver returns `null`. \n\nFor this purpose i created an `OptionalAsPropertyTypeSerializer` that I activate via `ObjectMapper.setDefaultTyping`. The code simply checks for null values and reacts accordingly.\n\nQuick example:\n\n``` java\nclass OptionalAsPropertyTypeSerializer extends TypeSerializerBase {\n\n    @Override\n    public void writeTypePrefixForObject(final Object value, final JsonGenerator jgen) throws IOException {\n        final String typeId = idFromValue(value);\n        if (typeId == null) {\n            jgen.writeStartObject();\n        } else if (jgen.canWriteTypeId()) {\n            jgen.writeTypeId(typeId);\n            jgen.writeStartObject();\n        } else {\n            jgen.writeStartObject();\n            jgen.writeStringField(_typePropertyName, typeId);\n        }\n        setCurrentValueInContext(value, jgen);\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
