A good document of problems is this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf\r\n\r\nwhich outlines existing security problems: expansion here could allow more constructors as potential attack vectors (esp. if it'd be for any number of parameters, not just one).\r\n\r\nNote that this specifically relates to polymorphic deserialization, in which attacker specifies class name of class to use -- in which case all they have to do is to fine suitable attack vector.\r\nWhile not trivial, it is quite doable with enough material. And with modern Java services, dependencies, there's a lot of material to sift through.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to really gauge potential for abuse here since I do not think many Java deserializers allow detection of such constructors (and since parameter name inclusion is still relatively new feature for bytecode). But absence of known cases at this point does not prove, in my opinion, that there are none. Rather that we simply do not know, but that there is good reason to suspect there are constructors that would be problematic, within widely used 3rd party libraries.\r\n\r\nThis is still different, of course, from my earlier objection of mismatched constructors.\r\nI think that is still somewhat valid concern too. But possibly something that we can design around, with good combination of visibility requirements, precedence.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/329015766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1246301113,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTI0NjMwMTExMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1246301113","actor":{"login":"lpandzic","id":4463380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjMzODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4463380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic","html_url":"https://github.com/lpandzic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-12T23:44:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1246301114,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEyNDYzMDExMTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1246301114","actor":{"login":"lpandzic","id":4463380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjMzODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4463380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic","html_url":"https://github.com/lpandzic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-12T23:44:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/329075116","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1498#issuecomment-329075116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1498","id":329075116,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTA3NTExNg==","user":{"login":"lpandzic","id":4463380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjMzODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4463380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic","html_url":"https://github.com/lpandzic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":fa

I understand your point, but is this a blocker for this feature? Considering default constructors and setters vs constructor I'm not sure why it would make much of a difference for an attacker? Don't you have to specify for polymorphic classes all instances of hierarchy on parent class and don't you always have to specify parent target in your code for deserialization? If target is ever concluded from serialized format (json) then that is the cause of security risks as you can program through serialized format and that is not good security wise.\r\n\r\nIf I want to

`@ConstructorProperties`) makes the test go green. Unfortunately I don't control the class so that I cannot add any annotations. Also, I thought adding the parameter names module should be sufficient as a name can now be derived from the class and additional annotations shouldn't be needed. I.e. the annotation would just redeclare what's already defined.\r\n- Adding an additional property makes the test pass. This is probably what strikes me most about the problem as it's complete unintuitive why a constructor wouldn't work for one parameter, but would for more than one.\r\n- The same applies if you rather expose a factory method than a constructor.\r\n- Even configuring a `Mode` explicitly doesn't change anything about the failing test.\r\n- The execution at some point invokes `findNameForDeserialization(…)` which ´ParameterNamesAnnotationIntrospector` does not override. Is that by design? Because if I go ahead and implement that method like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic PropertyName findNameForDeserialization(Annotated a) {\r\n\r\n\tif (a instanceof AnnotatedParameter) {\r\n\t\treturn PropertyName.construct(findParameterName((AnnotatedParameter) a));\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn super.findNameForDeserialization(a);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthings start to work again. I can see that this method is supposed to explicitly obtain a name from an annotation but it feels like that path is favored for a one-argument constructor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/50/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"lpandzic","id":4463380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjMzODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4463380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic","html_url":"https://github.com/lpandzic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpandzic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T13:06:41Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T13:06:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectlombok/lombok/issues/1708","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectlombok/lombok","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectlombok/lombok/issues/1708/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectlombok/lombok/issues/1708/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectlombok/lombok/issues/1708/events","html_url":"https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/1708","id":327531949,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjc1MzE5NDk=","number":1708,"title":"extraPrivate=true

our project I use value objects like the one below.

It also looks nice, the class has no Jackson annotations.\r\n\r\nHowever, after the private no-args constructor added in 1.16.22, Jackson will by default instantiate the object using the no-args constructor and then set the individual fields one by one. Without the all-args constructor, my defaults will no longer be enforced.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by explicitly adding the `@JsonCreator` to the all-args constructor. Leaving aside the extra annotation that's needed now, this sneaky change will silently break a lot of code that relies on an explicit constructor.\r\n\r\nPlease evaluate the \"noArgsConstructor.extraPrivate\" new feature against side-effects like the one mentioned here. Jackson was working fine for me without any extra annotation. What is the \"killer use-case\" for the new feature?\r\n\r\nAlso, `@Builder.Default` would NOT work with Jackson deserialization (before or after this change).\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Builder.Default\r\n    ImmutableList<Constraint> constraints = ImmutableList.of();\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectlombok/lombok/issues/1708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectlombok/lombok/issues/1708/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
