after looking at this a bit, I figured it out.\nSo: `Throwable`s are serialized as POJOs, and then the issue is due to:\n\n1. `Throwable.cause` field is set to `this` by default (to indicate no \"cause\" has been set)\n2. But `Throwable.getCause()` has this logic:\n\n```\n    public synchronized Throwable getCause() {\n        return (cause==this ? null : cause);\n    }\n```\n\nso that `throwable.getCause()` will \"convert\" `this` into `null` -- but direct Field access will not.\n\nSo if you forcibly prevent auto-detection of Methods (getters like `getCause()`) but allow auto-detection of any and all fields (like `cause`), we get this issue.\n\nBut this gives me an idea of how to possibly tackle the problem: will first check in failing test
