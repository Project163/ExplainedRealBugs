want to create a custom deserializer which have the sole purpose of providing a default value via `Pageable getNullValue(DeserializationContext ctxt)`.\r\n\r\n`PageRequest` class implements interface `Pageable`.\r\n\r\nThe deserializer:\r\n```java\r\nclass PageableDeserializer extends JsonDeserializer<Pageable> {\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Pageable deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException {\r\n    return p.getCodec().readValue(p, PageRequest.class);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Pageable getNullValue(DeserializationContext ctxt) throws JsonMappingException {\r\n    return Pageable.unpaged();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n @Override\r\n  public ObjectIdReader getObjectIdReader() {\r\n    return super.getObjectIdReader();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe deserializer must be able to keep working with `@JsonCreator`.\r\nNow correct me if I am wrong but I have no way to retrieve the default `ObjectIdReader` without having the `DeserializationContext` in `getObjectIdReader`?","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1825/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
