the bug**\r\nWhen attempting to deserialize a CSV with empty strings to an object with string fields, the fields are populated with `\"null\"` instead of the expected `null`. Note that this is using the `CsvParser.Feature.EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL` feature. \r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.13.3\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nMy project is using this code to deserialize CSV into a set of POJO objects:\r\n```java\r\npublic static <T> Set<T> deserializeSetFromCsvAtPath(Path path, Class<T> clazz) throws IOException {\r\n    Set<T> set = new HashSet<>();\r\n\r\n    try (InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(path)) {\r\n        CsvMapper mapper = new CsvMapper();\r\n        mapper.enable(CsvParser.Feature.EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL);\r\n\r\n        CsvSchema headerSchema = CsvSchema.emptySchema().withHeader();\r\n\r\n        MappingIterator<T> iterator = mapper\r\n                .readerFor(clazz)\r\n                .with(headerSchema)\r\n                .readValues(is);\r\n\r\n        while (iterator.hasNextValue()) {\r\n            set.add(iterator.nextValue());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    } catch (IOException e) {\r\n        throw new IOException(\"Failed to input stream file at \" + path, e);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return set;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are expecting that given a class like so:\r\n```java\r\npublic class Row {\r\n    private final Integer id;\r\n    private final String value;\r\n. . .\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would deserialize a CSV like this:\r\n```csv\r\nid,value\r\n1,\r\n```\r\n\r\nInto an object containing \r\n```\r\nid: 1\r\nvalue: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, we are experiencing\r\n```\r\nid: 1\r\nvalue: \"null\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThat given the code above, empty strings in a CSV will be deserialized to a `null` String object, instead of a String containing \"null\".\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSimilar to [this issue here](https://github.com/fasterxml/jackson-databind/issues/1842), only in a different context. Furthermore, I assume that the underlying issue is the same: \r\n> Use of `parser.getText()` unfortunately did include `\"null\"` as value. So better choice is `parser.getValueAsString()` which only coerces scalars, but returns `null` for JSON `null` as well as for structured tokens (START_ARRAY, START_OBJECT).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
