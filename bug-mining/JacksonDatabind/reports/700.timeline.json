TL;\r\n- When the `localName` property of `@JacksonXmlProperty` is not set, the `required` of `@JsonProperty` does not detect the property name of POJO.\r\n- I have an example to verify this phenomenon. I don't seem to see this documented in the documentation. This unit testing and reproduction process is located at https://github.com/linghengqian/jackson-mixed-annotations-test .\r\n```java\r\npublic class RequiredTest {\r\n    @Test\r\n    void assertRequiredValue() {\r\n        ObjectMapper XML_MAPPER = XmlMapper.builder().build();\r\n        Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow(() -> {\r\n            XML_MAPPER.readValue(\"\"\"\r\n                    <Record type=\"\">\r\n                        <driverClassName>\r\n                        </driverClassName>\r\n                    </Record>\r\n                    \"\"\", TestRecord.class);\r\n        });\r\n        Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow(() -> {\r\n            XML_MAPPER.readValue(\"\"\"\r\n                    <Record type=\"\">\r\n                        <driverClassName>\r\n                        </driverClassName>\r\n                    </Record>\r\n                    \"\"\", TestRecordWithoutLocalName.class);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Getter\r\n    @NoArgsConstructor\r\n    @JacksonXmlRootElement(localName = \"Record\")\r\n    static class TestRecord {\r\n        private String type;\r\n\r\n        private String driverClassName;\r\n\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        public TestRecord(\r\n                @JsonProperty(required = true) @JacksonXmlProperty(localName = \"type\", isAttribute = true)\r\n                String type,\r\n                @JsonProperty(required = true) @JacksonXmlProperty(localName = \"driverClassName\")\r\n                String driverClassName) {\r\n            this.type = type;\r\n            this.driverClassName = driverClassName;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Getter\r\n    @NoArgsConstructor\r\n    @JacksonXmlRootElement(localName = \"Record\")\r\n    static class TestRecordWithoutLocalName {\r\n        private String type;\r\n\r\n        private String driverClassName;\r\n\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        public TestRecordWithoutLocalName(\r\n                @JsonProperty(required = true) @JacksonXmlProperty(isAttribute = true)\r\n                String type,\r\n                @JsonProperty(required = true) @JacksonXmlProperty(localName = \"driverClassName\")\r\n                String driverClassName) {\r\n            this.type = type;\r\n            this.driverClassName = driverClassName;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- The second assertion will fail.\r\n- From my understanding, the `localName` attribute of `@JacksonXmlProperty` has the same function as https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations?tab=readme-ov-file#annotations-for-renaming-properties , but is used renaming of POJO properties.

issue.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2183917780/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimonCockx","id":47859223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODU5MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47859223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonCockx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13250034473,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAC5e2c5-IyM4zwAAAAMVw3sp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/13250034473","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-22T08:37:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13250034475,"node_id":"SE_lADOAC5e2c5-IyM4zwAAAAMVw3sr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/13250034475","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-22T08:37:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"SimonCockx","id":47859223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODU5MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47859223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonCockx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonCockx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-22T08:37:36Z","updated_at":"2024-06-22T08:37:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4595","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind

upgrading from Jackson 2.15.0 to 2.17.1, we noticed our custom annotation processor stopped working due to a change in behaviour in the way `PropertyName`s are merged. See #4364. I would like to know whether this is intended, and if it is, how I should migrate my code.\r\n\r\nWe have a custom XML annotation introspector which explicitly sets the wrapper name to `Property.NO_NAME` if our custom annotation is present and the type is a list:\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public PropertyName findWrapperName(Annotated ann) {\r\n        if (ann.hasAnnotation(RosettaAttribute.class) && hasCollectionType(ann)) {\r\n            // Disable wrapping of lists.\r\n            return PropertyName.NO_NAME;\r\n        }\r\n        return super.findWrapperName(ann);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis used to work in Jackson 2.15.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to the change in #4364, `PropertyName.NO_NAME` is now merged with `PropertyName.DEFAULT` from the default Jackson XML annotation introspector, and the new behaviour prefers `PropertyName.DEFAULT` over `PropertyName.NO_NAME`. The previous behaviour would prefer `PropertyName.NO_NAME`.\r\n\r\nI have not found a way to fix this. Is there a way to get rid of the default annotation processor?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @SimonCockx in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4364#issuecomment-2182307781_\r\n            ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2185321438","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4364#issuecomment-2185321438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4364","id":2185321438,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c6CQVve","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-23T20:59:02Z","updated_at":"2024-06-23T20:59:02Z","body":"NOTE: #4595 changes behavior for 2.17.2 to not merge `NO_NAME` case.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/2185321438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
