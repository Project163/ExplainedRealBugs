requested in FasterXML/jackson-module-scala#65, and discussed in [this thread](http://markmail.org/thread/3d44ktyzr72jv45z). This would take the form of:\n- A BaseSettings property that specifies the default radix for Number-to-String conversion. Defaults to 10.\n- A 'radix' parameter added to `JsonFormat` that overrides the default radix, if the shape is `STRING`\n- [optionally] A serialization feature to control whether numeric values are output as JSON numbers or JSON strings by default.\n\nAnother component of the request is to provide a way that instances of a certain type, for example `BigInteger`, could be serialized as strings of a certain radix. I would think that a Mix-In annotation on the type would be the simplest end-user interface for this, but I don't know if Jackson will recognize `@JsonFormat` at the class level, or recognize mix-in annotations for built-in types.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/221/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
