So that part may be fine in itself.\n\nBut bigger question is whether polymorphic typing can work with `@JsonValue`. The problem is that type information during serialization should refer to `CommandAPDU`, which is the logical type, even if physical serialization is as `byte[]`. In that sense class included seems wrong.\n\nI'll see if I can reproduce with given information.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/249590974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/250296029","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1385#issuecomment-250296029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1385","id":250296029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDI5NjAyOQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T20:52:18Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T20:52:18Z","body":"Hmmh.

unable to get Jackson to specified type information in JSON, both when registered via the `@JsonTypeName` annotation on a class I'm interested in serializing, and with the `@JsonSubTypes` annotation on a method in a composite class which contains the class I'm interested in serializing. This fails in a few different versions of Jackson for me. I'm not sure if I'm missing some sort of configuration somewhere or what, so I've included a gist reproducing the issue:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/brianv0/0dc42b7bd45b7a7b384e\n\nIn summary, what I get when serializing a BigDecimal, a java.lang.Integer, and a java.lang.String, where all classes have been annotated as subtypes of types decimal, integer, and string:\n\n```\n{\"$type\":\"MetadataView\",\"metadata\":\n   [{\"key\":\"hello_decimal\",\"value\":1234.4321,\"$type\":\"BigDecimal\"},\n   {\"key\":\"hello_integer\",\"value\":1234,\"$type\":\"integer\"},\n   {\"key\":\"hello_string\",\"value\":\"world\",\"$type\":\"string\"}]\n}\n```\n\nWhat I'd like:\n\n```\n{\"$type\":\"MetadataView\",\"metadata\":\n   [{\"key\":\"hello_decimal\",\"value\":1234.4321,\"$type\":\"decimal\"},\n   {\"key\":\"hello_integer\",\"value\":1234,\"$type\":\"integer\"},\n   {\"key\":\"hello_string\",\"value\":\"world\",\"$type\":\"string\"}]\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/466/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/309121205","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1385#issuecomment-309121205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1385","id":309121205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTEyMTIwNQ==","user":{"login":"onderson","id":1903588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDM1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1903588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson","html_url":"https://github.com/onderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onderson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T20:02:04Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T20:02:04Z","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nEither fix [#1385](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1385) or [#466](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/466) causes problem in [CAMEL-11308](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-11308)\r\n\r\nDowngrade  of jackson2 dependency to 2.8.3 resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nCould you check this cross reference?
