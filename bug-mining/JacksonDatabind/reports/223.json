and that new method takes `MapperConfig` to allow for configuration setting(s).\nIt may also make sense to combine handling of `findCreatorBinding()` at same time: maybe replace 2 existing methods with one new one.\n\nFor backwards compatibility it will be necessary to keep old methods but make deprecated; but also possible add some routing of old calls for 2.9.\n\nCurrently only other modules likely to be affected would be:\n- Scala module probably uses/overrides methods\n- Kotlin module is quite likely to, as well.\n\nso testing and collaboration would be needed to reduce likelihood of issues.\n\n/cc @nbauernfeind @apatrida\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
