vc;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen one that takes `JavaType` should never get `null`.\r\nBasically one should always indicate at least raw type deserializer handles (although granted other constructor should also have `null` check to enforce this).\r\n\r\nI am not necessarily 100% against adding back the check due to backwards compatibility aspects -- 3.0 development is starting and this is probably better place to add stricter checks, all things considered -- but at this point I would recommend changing code to actually pass a non-null value like `Object.class` (or, ideally, if more specific type is known, that).\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/328676487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/328764631","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1764#issuecomment-328764631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1764","id":328764631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODc2NDYzMQ==","user":{"login":"mehmetsalgar","id":433232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzIzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/433232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar","html_url":"https://github.com/mehmetsalgar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehmetsalgar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-12T07:27:06Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T07:29:06Z","body":"If

I think original submitted mentioned 2.6 as the version he was using. But I think same conditions apply up until 2.8.x.\r\n\r\nChange in question is in 2.9, removal of one `null` check. I may bring that back, but fundamentally I think calling code (sub-class of `StdDeserializer`) should probably be changed so that instead of calling \r\n\r\n    public StdDeserializer(JavaType t)\r\n\r\nwith `null`, it should call\r\n\r\n    public StdDeserializer(Class<?> type)\r\n\r\nwith non-null value (if not known, `Object.class`) is fine. Passing `null` would probably not fail either and would be improvement as well.\r\n\r\nSo what I was hoping was to suggest a minor improvement since passing of `null` as `JavaType` is probably going to disappear from later versions.\r\n\r\nDoes this make more sense?
