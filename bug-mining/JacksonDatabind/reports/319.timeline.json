[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30205006/why-does-jackson-2-not-recognize-the-first-capital-letter-if-the-leading-camel-c) and by reference [this](http://futuretask.blogspot.co.uk/2005/01/java-tip-6-dont-capitalize-first-two.html).\r\n\r\nHowever in the world of Kotlin, we are several steps removed from Java beans or indeed the underlying setters/getters that Kotlin automatically generates, and this behaviour doesn't make a great deal of sense. It was only by accident that I discovered it.\r\n\r\nPlease consider whether there's an opportunity to bypass this issue via the Kotlin module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/92/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
