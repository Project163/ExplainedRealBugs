My thinking is that if en explicit serializer (`using` etc) is specified, that is to be used as-is, and converter to be ignored. Type override is still used, although it does not necessarily matter.\nOnly if no explicit serializer is specific is converter considered.\n\nQuestion of `as` is interesting one; my gut feeling is that since it specifies input type (for converter), it should not have much if any effect -- converter's output type is what should be used for locating serializer to use.\nBut things get even more complicated with structured types; so perhaps it would be best to state that none of type modifiers are to be used with
