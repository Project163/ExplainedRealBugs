But it looks like this is a Jackson issue.  Here's the rerproducer:\n\n``` java\npublic class TestPropertyNamingStrategyIssue {\n  public static class ClassWithObjectNodeField {\n    public String id;\n    public ObjectNode json;\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void reproducer() throws Exception {\n    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n    mapper.setPropertyNamingStrategy(PropertyNamingStrategy.LOWER_CASE);\n    ClassWithObjectNodeField deserialized =\n        mapper.readValue(\n            \"{ \\\"id\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"json\\\": { \\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"baz\\\": \\\"bing\\\" } }\",\n            ClassWithObjectNodeField.class);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLooks like the presence of any PropertyNamingStrategy make deserialization to ObjectNode fail.  This works fine if I remove the property naming strategy.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
