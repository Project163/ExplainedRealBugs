Moving the annotation bundel to the actual class seems to resolve the issue.  Below is a simple test that attempts to rename a property.  I have more complicated test cases that are also failing but this should provide some context.\n\n``` java\npublic class Fun {\n\n    @Test\n    public void test() throws JsonProcessingException {\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper().addMixIn(Foo.class, FooMixin.class);\n        String result = mapper.writeValueAsString(new Foo(\"result\"));\n        Assert.assertEquals(\"{\\\"bar\\\":\\\"result\\\"}\", result);\n    }\n\n    @Target(value={ ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD })\n    @Retention(value=RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\n    @JacksonAnnotationsInside\n    @JsonProperty(\"bar\")\n    public @interface ExposeStuff {\n\n    }\n\n    public abstract class FooMixin {\n        @ExposeStuff\n        public abstract String getStuff();\n    }\n\n    public class Foo {\n\n        private String stuff;\n\n        Foo(String stuff) {\n            this.stuff = stuff;\n        }\n\n        public String getStuff() {\n            return stuff;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI'm expecting the \"stuff\" property to be serialized as \"bar\".\n\nI apologize I haven't been able to identify the culprit (and perhaps it's in my usage).  Let me know your thoughts. I'm always happy to provide more details!\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
