This is almost everything that can be overridden on per-type (Class) bases, except for one thing: `@JsonFormat` is overridable on per-type basis but not globally.\r\nThe reason for this is that most settings do not make sense in general context: for example, setting `Shape` default for everything is unlikely to make sense in most cases.\r\n\r\nBut although most settings are not useful, one thing is: \"leniency\". Global default currently something like \"implicitly enabled\", but there is no way to change that: instead, type overrides must be applied to change leniency to \"strict\" (that is, disabled).\r\n\r\nSo, let's add setting in 2.10.\r\n\r\nNote that 3.0 is planned to introduce an intermediate level of \"Type categories\" (so, something like \"all date/time types\", \"all numbers\", \"all sequences\", \"all map-like\") which may then allow `@JsonFormat` overrides for wider groups. But there is still need for global leniency setting.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2424/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
