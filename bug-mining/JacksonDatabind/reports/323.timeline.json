First of all, thank you for reporting this.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if there were cases where refinement could lead to loss of typing, but should not.\r\nYour example declaration looks a good start for trying to come up with a failing test case.\r\nI am not so sure about the fix, although it too could probably help here. One concern I have is that specific logic wrt interface/concrete class may not be required or exact rule, so it'd be good to have sort of counter cases. But if and when existing tests pass, that is at least some verification that change wouldn't be very risky.\r\n\r\nBut one thing that is needed is to base this off of 2.9(.0.pr4). There have been quite significant changes in handling, and it is likely that fixes may only be safe enough to make for 2.9 at this point (since 2.8 patches extend to quite far, and once 2.9 is out, specifically, I want to minimize risk for 2.8 patches... have had some problems in this area lately :) ).\r\n\r\nSo would it be possible to quickly verify that patch also works for 2.9.0.pr4? I hope to look into this, too, but I do have quite full a plate unfortunately.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/315870746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1167162807,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExNjcxNjI4MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1167162807","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-17T20:19:41Z","label":{"name":"2.9","color":"0e8a16"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/315874810","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1705#issuecomment-315874810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1705","id":315874810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTg3NDgxMA==","user":{"login":"tbartley","id":3344028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDQwMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3344028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley","html_url":"https://github.com/tbartley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbartley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T20:34:28Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T20:34:28Z","body":"Sure thing.
