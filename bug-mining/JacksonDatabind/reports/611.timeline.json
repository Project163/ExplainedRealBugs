the bug**\r\nSetting whitespace string to an `int` property while `ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS` and `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` are disabled, results in `Cannot coerce null to int` error, while empty string is considered an actual string in that case.\r\nThis could potentially become a problem if `int` was changed to `Integer`. In that case json will be successfully parsed for whitespace string and fail for empty.\r\n\r\nMight be related to https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3234\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.13.3\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nMapper builder\r\n```java\r\nnew Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder()\r\n    .featuresToDisable(MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS)\r\n    .featuresToDisable(DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT)\r\n    .featuresToDisable(DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_SINGLE_VALUE_AS_ARRAY)\r\n    .featuresToDisable(DeserializationFeature.UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS)\r\n    .featuresToEnable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES)\r\n    .featuresToEnable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_MISSING_CREATOR_PROPERTIES);\r\n```\r\nTest code\r\n```java\r\ntest(\"\\\"\\\"\");\r\ntest(\"\\\" \\\"\");\r\ntest(\"\\\"    \\\"\");\r\ntest(\"\\\"\\\\n\\\"\");\r\n\r\nvoid test(String value) throws Exception {\r\n    System.out.println(\"{\\\"value\\\":\" + value + \"}\");\r\n    try {\r\n        Model model = OM.readValue(\"{\\\"value\\\":\" + value + \"}\", Model.class);\r\n    } catch (JsonMappingException e) {\r\n        System.out.println(e.getLocalizedMessage());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Model {\r\n    private int value;\r\n\r\n    public Model() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setValue(int value) {\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public int getValue() {\r\n        return this.value;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutput\r\n```\r\n{\"value\":\"\"}\r\nCannot coerce empty String (\"\") to `int` value (but could if coercion was enabled using `CoercionConfig`)\r\n at [Source: (String)\"{\"value\":\"\"}\"; line: 1, column: 10] (through reference chain: test.MainTest$Model[\"value\"])\r\n{\"value\":\" \"}\r\nCannot coerce `null` to `int` value (disable `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES` to allow)\r\n at [Source: (String)\"{\"value\":\" \"}\"; line: 1, column: 10] (through reference chain: test.MainTest$Model[\"value\"])\r\n{\"value\":\"    \"}\r\nCannot coerce `null` to `int` value (disable `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES` to allow)\r\n at [Source: (String)\"{\"value\":\"    \"}\"; line: 1, column: 10] (through reference chain: test.MainTest$Model[\"value\"])\r\n{\"value\":\"\\n\"}\r\nCannot coerce `null` to `int` value (disable `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES` to allow)\r\n at [Source: (String)\"{\"value\":\"\\n\"}\"; line: 1, column: 10] (through reference chain: test.MainTest$Model[\"value\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhitespace string should be handled as any other string.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3518/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14794525876,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c45ZKXqzwAAAANx0oy0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/14794525876","actor":{"login":"ggrebert","id":1737774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mzc3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1737774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert","html_url":"https://github.com/ggrebert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c100ed5b3bbb2ae7d1287ae368672469a1bafd0c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ggrebert/jackson-databind/commits/c100ed5b3bbb2ae7d1287ae368672469a1bafd0c","created_at":"2024-10-22T23:36:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
