I agree with notes on 2 main challenges, but there is also third immediate problem wrt tests: type for `List` is actually `final` which is what sort of breaks the test since:\r\n\r\n1. During serialization, actual type -- which is `final` -- will result in no type information being added, BUT\r\n2. During deserialization, requested type -- `List` -- is NON-FINAL and as such no type information is excepted\r\n\r\nso test would fail even if special handling was added.\r\n\r\nFor now I think I can at least add failing test(s), under `src/test-jdk14/` to allow reproducing the issue, in case someone has time to look deeper into possible solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/724451024/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3976981356,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50Mzk3Njk4MTM1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/3976981356","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-10T05:00:33Z","label":{"name":"to-evaluate","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3976981357,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM5NzY5ODEzNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/3976981357","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-10T05:00:33Z","label":{"name":"has-failing-test","color":"4e8a16"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3976982383,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5NzY5ODIzODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/3976982383","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type

want to use `Map.of()` in my execution context (primarily for tests). But this gives an error:\r\n```java\r\nval serializer = new Jackson2ExecutionContextStringSerializer();\r\nval out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\nserializer.serialize(Map.of(\"f\", Map.of(\"f1\", \"v1\")), out);\r\nval json = out.toString();\r\nSystem.out.println(json);\r\nserializer.deserialize(new ByteArrayInputStream(json.getBytes()));\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```java\r\n{\"f\":{\"@class\":\"java.util.ImmutableCollections$Map1\",\"f1\":\"v1\"}}\r\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidTypeIdException: Could not resolve subtype of [map type; class java.util.HashMap, [simple type, class java.lang.String] -> [simple type, class java.lang.Object]]: missing type id property '@class'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the typing inside `Jackson2ExecutionContextStringSerializer` is configured to `ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL` which skips the addition of `@class` property to the root object for some reason, even though `ImmutableCollections$Map1` is `final`. So, as you can see, only the inner map has it. But if we try to serialize `new HashMap<>(Map.of(\"f\", Map.of(\"f1\", \"v1\")))` then it does include it for the root. \r\nOne solution to it is to use `ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.EVERYTHING` or enable `MapperFeature.USE_BASE_TYPE_AS_DEFAULT_IMPL` so that the `ObjectMapper` doesn't need to check against `@class` property if it's given the type at compile time. \r\n\r\nIt knows that it's supposed to be a `HashMap` from `Jackson2ExecutionContextStringSerializer#deserialize`:\r\n```java\r\npublic Map<String, Object> deserialize(InputStream in) throws IOException {\r\n    TypeReference<HashMap<String,Object>> typeRef = new TypeReference<HashMap<String,Object>>() {};\r\n    return objectMapper.readValue(in, typeRef);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, with enabling the feature, another error comes out:\r\n```java\r\nval serializer = new Jackson2ExecutionContextStringSerializer();\r\n((ObjectMapper) FieldUtils.readField(serializer, \"objectMapper\", true))\r\n        .enable(MapperFeature.USE_BASE_TYPE_AS_DEFAULT_IMPL);\r\nval out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\nserializer.serialize(Map.of(\"f\", Map.of(\"f1\", \"v1\")), out);\r\nval json = out.toString();\r\nSystem.out.println(json);\r\nserializer.deserialize(new ByteArrayInputStream(json.getBytes()));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output:\r\n```java\r\n{\"f\":{\"@class\":\"java.util.ImmutableCollections$Map1\",\"f1\":\"v1\"}}\r\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: The class with java.util.ImmutableCollections$Map1 and name of java.util.ImmutableCollections$Map1 is not trusted. If you believe this class is safe to deserialize, you can add it to the base set of trusted classes at construction time or provide an explicit mapping using Jackson annotations or a custom ObjectMapper. If the serialization is only done by a trusted source, you can also enable default typing. (through reference chain: java.util.HashMap[\"f\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think all `java.util.ImmutableCollections$*` should be enabled by default. \r\n\r\nWith adding those, another error comes out:\r\n```java\r\n  val serializer = new Jackson2ExecutionContextStringSerializer(\r\n          \"java.util.ImmutableCollections$ListN\",\r\n          \"java.util.ImmutableCollections$List12\",\r\n          \"java.util.ImmutableCollections$SubList\",\r\n          \"java.util.ImmutableCollections$Set12\",\r\n          \"java.util.ImmutableCollections$SetN\",\r\n          \"java.util.ImmutableCollections$Map1\",\r\n          \"java.util.ImmutableCollections$MapN\"\r\n  );\r\n  ((ObjectMapper) FieldUtils.readField(serializer, \"objectMapper\", true))\r\n          .enable(MapperFeature.USE_BASE_TYPE_AS_DEFAULT_IMPL);\r\n  val out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n  serializer.serialize(Map.of(\"f\", Map.of(\"f1\", \"v1\")), out);\r\n  val json = out.toString();\r\n  System.out.println(json);\r\n  val res = serializer.deserialize(new ByteArrayInputStream(json.getBytes()));\r\n  System.out.println(res);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output:\r\n```java\r\n{\"f\":{\"@class\":\"java.util.ImmutableCollections$Map1\",\"f1\":\"v1\"}}\r\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: Cannot construct instance of `java.util.ImmutableCollections$Map1` (no Creators, like default constructor, exist): no default constructor found\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's a Jackson issue https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2900 that's already been fixed in `2.13.0`. So, after updating the Jackson library to `2.13.0` the last code snippet gives the correct output:\r\n```java\r\n{\"f\":{\"@class\":\"java.util.ImmutableCollections$Map1\",\"f1\":\"v1\"}}\r\n{f={f1=v1}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\nSpring Batch 4.3.3\r\nSpring Boot 2.5.0\r\nJDK Amazon

the bug**\r\nJDK 16 introduced `Stream#toList()` which creates `UnmodifiableList` while `.collect(Collectors.toList())` generates `ArrayList`.\r\nChanging the old collectors toList with the direct call to  `Stream#toList()` caused errors when deserealizing with `defaultTyping` configuration\r\n\r\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidTypeIdException: Could not resolve type id 'a' as a subtype of `java.lang.Object`: no such class found\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\njackson 2.13.1\r\njdk 16\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n    var objectMapper = new ObjectMapper()\r\n        .activateDefaultTyping(LaissezFaireSubTypeValidator.instance,

an issue removing Objects from a Redisson List (tested not working on List, Queue and Deque).\r\nRemoving by index works, removing by value (using the method remove(Object) on BaseRedissonList) doesn't work if the Object contains ImmutableCollections objects.\r\n\r\nPlease find more infos below:\r\n\r\n**Redis version (from INFO command):** 7.2.3 \r\n**Redisson version:** 3.27.0 (with Quarkus v3.7.4)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`boolean remove(Object)` should remove the Object from the list and return true\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nThe method returns false and, checking using `redis-cli` tool, the Object doesn't get removed from the list.\r\n\r\n`BaseRedissonList::remove(Object)` internally calls the Redis command `LREM` which removes the Object comparing the string value, built after the Codec encoding.\r\nThe JavaJacksonCodec() codec encodes/decodes internal Java9 collections using different classes, so the LREM command doesn't work properly.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\nSwitching to Kryo5Codec (which is default), the remove(Object) method works correctly.\r\n\r\n**TestCase showing issue, using Java9 immutable collections classes**\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\npublic void givenDtoWithJava9ImmutableListTypeTestRemoveFromListUsingJacksonCodecDoesntWork() throws IOException {\r\n    TestDto testDto = new TestDto();\r\n    testDto.id = 10L;\r\n    testDto.list = List.of(\"test1v1\", \"test1v2\");\r\n\r\n    RList<TestDto> queue = redissonClient.getList(\"testlist\", new JsonJacksonCodec());\r\n    queue.addAll(Arrays.asList(testDto));\r\n\r\n    TestDto first = queue.getFirst();\r\n\r\n    ByteBuf firstEncodedBuffer = new JsonJacksonCodec().getValueEncoder().encode(first);\r\n    ByteBuf removedEncodedBuffer = new JsonJacksonCodec().getValueEncoder().encode(testDto);\r\n\r\n    boolean removed = queue.remove(first);\r\n    int queueSize = queue.size();\r\n\r\n    // deleting test queue\r\n    queue.delete();\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(\"getFirst id \" + first.id);\r\n    System.out.println(\"Dto encoded: \" + firstEncodedBuffer.toString(Charset.defaultCharset()));\r\n    System.out.println(\"First encoded: \" + removedEncodedBuffer.toString(Charset.defaultCharset()));\r\n\r\n    Assertions.assertThat(removed).isFalse();\r\n    Assertions.assertThat(firstEncodedBuffer).isNotEqualTo(removedEncodedBuffer);\r\n    Assertions.assertThat(queueSize).isEqualTo(1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEncoding result between the two objects is not the same, thus remove doesn't work correctly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDto encoding output: {\"@class\":\"io.pms.redisson.JsonJacksonCodecIssueRedissonClientTest$TestDto\",\"id\":[\"java.lang.Long\",10],\"list\":[\"java.util.ArrayList\",[\"test1v1\",\"test1v2\"]]}\r\nFirst encoding output:

TestCase using Java ArrayList class**\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n```\r\npublic class JsonJacksonCodecIssueRedissonClientTest {\r\n    private RedissonClient redissonClient;\r\n    private Config config;\r\n\r\n    public static class TestDto implements Serializable {\r\n        public Long id;\r\n        public List<String> list;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    public void setUp() {\r\n        config = new Config();\r\n        config.useSingleServer().setAddress(\"redis://127.0.0.1:6379\");\r\n        redissonClient = Redisson.create(config);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nTest case:\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\npublic void givenDtoWithJavaArrayListRemoveFromListUsingJacksonCodecWorks() throws IOException {\r\n    TestDto testDto = new TestDto();\r\n    testDto.id = 10L;\r\n    testDto.list = new ArrayList<>(List.of(\"testv1\", \"testv2\"));\r\n\r\n    RList<TestDto> queue = redissonClient.getList(\"testlist\", new JsonJacksonCodec());\r\n

removedEncodedBuffer = new JsonJacksonCodec().getValueEncoder().encode(testDto);\r\n\r\n    boolean removed = queue.remove(first);\r\n    int queueSize = queue.size();\r\n\r\n    // deleting test

Assertions.assertThat(firstEncodedBuffer).isEqualTo(removedEncodedBuffer);\r\n    Assertions.assertThat(queueSize).isZero();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEncoding result is the same, thus remove works correctly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDto encoding output:
