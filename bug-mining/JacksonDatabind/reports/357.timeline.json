Describe the bug\r\nLocale with BCP 47 extensions are not serialized / de-serialized as expected using `ObjectMapper`.\r\n\r\n # Version information\r\nWhich Jackson version(s) was this for?\r\nAll Jackson versions.\r\n\r\n# To Reproduce\r\nIf you have a way to reproduce this with:\r\n\r\n## Brief code sample/snippet: include here in pre-formatted/code section\r\n```\r\nLocale locale = Locale.forLanguageTag(\"en-US-x-debug\");\r\n// ^^^ above locale will have x-debug as extensions\r\n// This locale is a BCP 47 compliant locale.\r\n\r\nObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\r\nString serializedLocale = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(locale);\r\n// ^^^ Will be en_US-#x-debug. Conforms to toString() method of Locale.\r\n// This is not correct. There is a rogue # is added before extensions. \r\n\r\nLocale deserializedLocale = objectMapper.readValue(serializedLocale, Locale.class); \r\n// ^^^ Due to the rogue # before the extensions, when we de-serialize it, the extensions get added as a Variant instead of extensions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Longer example stored somewhere else (diff repo, snippet), add a link\r\nN/A. Reproducible with the above piece of code.\r\n\r\n## Textual explanation: \r\n* `forLanguageTag` locale is used to create a locale object from a BCP 47 compliant locale string. The `x-debug` gets added as extensions in the Locale.\r\n* However, when we use ObjectMapper to serialize the string, objectMapper uses `toString()` method of locale to convert it to String. \r\n* As Per Locale Javadocs, for BCP 47 locales, we must be using `toLanguageTag()` and `forLanguageTag()` instead to convert to / from String. \r\n* Due to this, when we try to de-serialize this malformed Locale, the `x-debug` gets added as a Variant instead of extensions, which is not expected.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n* BCP 47 extensions should be added as extensions and not as Variants when serializing and de-serializing. \r\n\r\n## Additional Details\r\n* Due to this drawback, we are forced to write our own serializer / de-serializer. It would be nice if ObjectMapper provides us a Module which does this for us.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
