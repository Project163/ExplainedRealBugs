follow-up for https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/229)\r\n\r\nSo, XML presents unique problem for `JsonNode` support in that there is a possibility of seeing what looks like duplicate properties: this is common in XML since sequences of elements are legal, and do not need to be unique unlike JSON properties.\r\nOne consequence of this is that currently (as of 2.11) use of `JsonNode` with XML is limited.\r\n\r\nBut it seems relatively simple to allow special mode in which such duplicates would be used to \"auto-convert\" existing entry for property into `ArrayNode` (if it isn't already one) to allow better support.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2732/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
