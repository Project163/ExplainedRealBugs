Clone the repository at https://github.com/huxi/sulky\n2. Execute the contained `./gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`\n3. Clone the repository at https://github.com/huxi/lilith/\n4. Change jackson-version [in the project.ext.versions map of dependencyDefinitions.gradle](https://github.com/huxi/lilith/blob/master/dependencyDefinitions.gradle#L6) from `'2.3.3'` to `'2.4.0'`.\n5. Execute the contained `./gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`\n\nThere will be six test-failures with 2.4.0 that won't happen with 2.3.3.\n\nThere are actually only 2 test-methods that fail 3 times each.\n\nThose methods reside at [full()](https://github.com/huxi/lilith/blob/master/lilith-data/logging-io-test/src/main/java/de/huxhorn/lilith/data/logging/test/LoggingEventIOTestBase.java#L230) and [nullArgument()](https://github.com/huxi/lilith/blob/master/lilith-data/logging-io-test/src/main/java/de/huxhorn/lilith/data/logging/test/LoggingEventIOTestBase.java#L120).\n\nI first suspected that `AfterburnerModule` might be the culprit but removing it from `LoggingJsonDecoder`/`LoggingJsonEncoder` didn't fix the problem.\n\nSorry for not narrowing down the problem further. I'll give this another look tomorrow but you may already be able to find the issue in the meantime.\n\nThe interesting thing is that several other test cases are working as intended...\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
