But I suspect this is because my default TimeZone (PST) differs from what you have, and that keeps actual date serialization the same.\n\nI can not yet determine whether there is a bug or not; the problem is with lack of time-zone information with `SimpleDateFormat`, and how that affects end-to-end processing. Ideally given example should work, given that you have not changed settings, and although use of timezone-less formats is dangerous in itself (JDK's `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` always have both date and time parts, as well as associated `TimeZone`), it would seem like here things should still work the way you expect.\n\nSo I will try to dig bit deeper to understand where exactly timezone changes.\n\nThere are things you can do to work around the issue. Specifically, I think that setting `SimpleDateFormat.setTimeZone()` to same value as what `ObjectMapper` has should synchronize handling. This probably makes sense at any rate.\n2.6 does change the handling so that `TimeZone` format has is NOT overriding by context `TimeZone` ObjectMapper has: this prevents accidental overrides for cases where caller has specifically set the time zone.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/142375835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/142503639","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/939#issuecomment-142503639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/939","id":142503639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjUwMzYzOQ==","user":{"login":"anpieber","id":121043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTA0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber","html_url":"https://github.com/anpieber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpieber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-23T05:59:07Z","updated_at":"2015-09-23T05:59:07Z","body":"Thank you very, very much for your fast answer!\n\nActually you're right, of course it is about the timezone...
