my application, I am attempting to serialize and deserialize a Map implementation with additional properties. According to @cowtowncoder adding the `@JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT)` annotation will make Jackson treat the Map implementation as a plain old object. The result being JSON that includes additional properties as well as successfully deserializing those properties. This is stated in the blog post [On Jackson: Serializing Lists, Maps with properties](http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2013/10/entry_482.html). The example given there deals with a List implementation and the same functionality is promised for Map implementations. I have used this technique with success for Lists, but it is not working for Maps.\r\n\r\nHere is a reproduction of the issue. First, the map implementation:\r\n\r\n\timport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonFormat;\r\n\r\n\timport java.util.Collection;\r\n\timport java.util.HashMap;\r\n\timport java.util.Map;\r\n\timport java.util.Set;\r\n\r\n\t@JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT)\r\n\tpublic class MapImplementation implements Map<Integer, Integer> {\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate Map<Integer, Integer> map;\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate int property;\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic MapImplementation() {\r\n\t\t\tmap = new HashMap<>();\r\n\t\t\tproperty = 0;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic Map<Integer, Integer> getMap() {\r\n\t\t\treturn map;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic void setMap(Map<Integer, Integer> map) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.map = map;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic int getProperty() {\r\n\t\t\treturn property;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic void setProperty(int property) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.property = property;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic int size() {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.size();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic boolean isEmpty() {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.isEmpty();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic boolean containsKey(Object key) {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.containsKey(key);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic boolean containsValue(Object value) {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.containsValue(value);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic Integer get(Object key) {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.get(key);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic Integer put(Integer key, Integer value) {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.put(key, value);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic Integer remove(Object key) {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.remove(key);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic void putAll(Map<? extends Integer, ? extends Integer> m) {\r\n\t\t\tmap.putAll(m);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic void clear() {\r\n\t\t\tmap.clear();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic Set<Integer> keySet() {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.keySet();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic Collection<Integer> values() {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.values();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic Set<Entry<Integer, Integer>> entrySet() {\r\n\t\t\treturn map.entrySet();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nAnd here are two unit tests I expect to pass, but currently fail:\r\n\r\n\timport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n\timport org.junit.Assert;\r\n\timport org.junit.Test;\r\n\r\n\timport java.io.IOException;\r\n\r\n\tpublic class SerializationTest {\r\n\r\n\t\t@Test\r\n\t\tpublic void serializationTest1() throws IOException {\r\n\t\t\tObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tMapImplementation map = new MapImplementation();\r\n\t\t\tmap.setProperty(55);\r\n\t\t\tmap.put(12, 45);\r\n\t\t\tmap.put(6, 88);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tString jsonMap = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(map);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tString expectedJsonMap = \"{\\\"map\\\" : {\\\"6\\\" : 88, \\\"12\\\" : 45}, \\\"property\\\" : 55}\";\r\n\r\n\t\t\t//compare the json strings ignoring whitespace\r\n\t\t\tAssert.assertEquals(expectedJsonMap.replace(\"\\\\s+\", \"\"), jsonMap.replace(\"\\\\s+\", \"\"));\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Test\r\n\t\tpublic void serializationTest2() throws IOException {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tMapImplementation expectedMap = new MapImplementation();\r\n\t\t\texpectedMap.setProperty(55);\r\n\t\t\texpectedMap.put(12, 45);\r\n\t\t\texpectedMap.put(6, 88);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tString jsonMap = \"{\\\"map\\\" : {\\\"6\\\" : 88, \\\"12\\\" : 45}, \\\"property\\\" : 55}\";\r\n\r\n\t\t\t//This line throws:\r\n\t\t\t//com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException: Can not deserialize Map key of type java.lang.Integer from String \"map\"\r\n\t\t\tMapImplementation map = objectMapper.readValue(jsonMap, MapImplementation.class);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tAssert.assertEquals(expectedMap.getProperty(), map.getProperty());\r\n\t\t\tAssert.assertEquals(expectedMap.getMap(), map.getMap());\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThe first test checks the serialized map against the expected JSON output. We recieve {\"12\":45,\"6\":88} when I expect {\"map\" : {\"6\" : 88, \"12\" : 45}, \"property\" : 55}. That is, the property is not included in the serialization.\r\n\r\nThe second test checks that a MapImplementation can be reproduced from the JSON string {\"map\" : {\"6\" : 88, \"12\" : 45}, \"property\" : 55}. This operation fails saying an Integer cannot be created from \"map\", implying that the top level object is expected to be a Map<Integer, Integer>.\r\n\r\nI am using Jackson 2.8.6. To deal with this issue, I currently have a workaround in place using a custom serializer and deserializer.
