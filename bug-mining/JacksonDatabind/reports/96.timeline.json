looks like the fix to issue [#795] introduced a bug as illustrated by the test case. An `ArrayStoreException` occurs when attempting to assign an `ObjectIdReferenceProperty` to the `creatorProps` array, understandably.  Others have mentioned this on a similar (but I believe un-related) issue [here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/687#issuecomment-113097184) and [here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/687#issuecomment-124600369).\n\nDoing something like `Arrays.copyOf(...)` when the `CreatorProperty` array is returned from the value instantiator [here](https://github.com/dharaburda/jackson-databind/blob/4d4ddae6ee2f3f755fe25666082f8703015b23e7/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/BeanDeserializerBase.java#L412) prevents the `ArrayStoreException` but seems to cause downstream problems.
