was able to reproduce something similar to both https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1535 and https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/247 with pure java code, on the latest versions of the jackson ecosystem (2.10.0.pr2 at the time).\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nI can't customize serialization of Map keys with `@JsonProperty(keyUsing, using)` nor with `@JsonSerialize` in a way that is simple (uses a single serializer) and consistent. The issue is seen both on inline Maps and on data class Map properties mapped with `@JsonProperty`. Serialization of Map values work perfectly in most cases though.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample gradle project with 4 scenarios:\r\n- <1> enum classes failing\r\n- <2> data classes failing\r\n- <3> enum classes passing with the workaround described in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1535#issuecomment-282045617\r\n- <4> data classes passing with the same workaround\r\n\r\nThere are 6 tests for each scenario:\r\n- <1> serialize a simple object A\r\n- <2> deserialize a simple object A\r\n- <3> serialize a nested object B with a property Map<A, A>\r\n- <4> deserialize a nested object B with a property Map<A, A>\r\n- <5> serialize an inline Map<A, A>\r\n- <6> deserialize an inline Map<A, A>\r\n\r\nAll deserialization tests pass, for all scenarios.\r\nThe serialization for nested object and inline maps fail for scenarios 1 and 2.\r\nThe failures are slightly different in some cases, and exactly the same in other cases.\r\nThe behaviour is exactly the same in Java and in Kotlin (just for the sake of argument).\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\n\r\nI created a sample project with all source classes and unit tests needed to reproduce the scenarios+cases mentioned. The kotlin version is not attached there, but is available on my comment at https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1535#issuecomment-530791770. The project I created here, however, is a lot more robust, reviewed, complete, and clean than the initial kotlin version I had.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fredgalvao/jackson-key-serialization-tests\r\n\r\n## Extra\r\n\r\nChanging the serializer to `JsonSerializer` as https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-map uses, also changes nothing (as expected, I guess), which actually makes me believe that Baeldung is wrong on that example/tutorial.\r\n\r\n**If I want to reuse the same serializer on all scenarios**:\r\nBased on https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/661, if I use `writeString` some fail, if I use `writeFieldName` some other fail.\r\n\r\n**If I accept separate serializers**\r\nIf I make two separate serializers (the reproduction code has this by default), one for A (using `writeString`) and one for B (using `writeFieldName`), then 1_3 and 2_3 pass, but the inline map tests still fail, so it's not a solution.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nSo far, only `@JsonValue` and `@JsonCreator` works *everywhere*, but that shouldn't be the case afaik. Please feel free to point me to a piece of documentation or explanation that would make all of this a \"you were using it wrong altogether\" or \"this is by design\". I'll accept the workaround as a final solution with ease (I already did, actually).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2719441914,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDI3MTk0NDE5MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2719441914","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-16T23:37:03Z","milestone":{"title":"2.11.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2719442895,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjcxOTQ0Mjg5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2719442895","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-16T23:37:42Z","rename":{"from":"Support

that Jackson can deserialize maps with `WireSafeEnum` as keys (which has nicer ergonomics and reduces friction to using `WireSafeEnum`, since plain enums support this already).\r\n\r\nThis test is probably most illustrative of the new functionality:\r\nhttps://github.com/HubSpot/hubspot-immutables/commit/464f9207f1c61ccfc505230f2a051f3704dbb124#diff-8095941f2209daf7eb627be2a5d6be0953a3073a8a4e4e91d239abbe945fcadbR537-R549\r\n\r\nI thought we might need a `KeySerializer` as well, but it doesn't seem to be necessary.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this PR requires upgrading Jackson in order to pick up this feature: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2503\r\n\r\nWe're already using 2.12.6 internally, so this doesn't actually represent a change for us. However upgrading Jackson caused a few test failures that I need to investigate.\r\n\r\n@stevie400 @Xcelled @suruuK @kmclarnon ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HubSpot/hubspot-immutables/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HubSpot/hubspot-immutables/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
