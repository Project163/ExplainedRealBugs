this gets bit tricky. What I was able to do was to ensure that creator properties are sorted alphabetically, when feature is enabled. But they will still come before non-creator properties, unless explicit ordering by name is used.\nSo it will work for your case.\n\nThe reason I am hesitant with change to do full ordering for all properties is that this changes observed behavior; and since 'strictly ordered' datatypes default to alphabetic ordering. Further, although deserializer can buffer and sort creator properties if needs to, there are benefits from trying to output them first, to reduce need for buffering.\n\nIf full ordering is important, it will be possible to add another feature flag to define such behavior -- feel free to file a separate request if so.
