There are a number of other protected methods in TypeParser that take a MyTokenizer instance as input too.\r\n\r\nI would prefer if a lot more of jackson-databind was private. Making so many methods protected has consequences. It requires that a lot of other code needs to be public or protected.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it could be viewed as breaking binary compatibility but I think the MyTokenizer should be made private or left as package private and the API methods that take MyTokenizer inputs could be changed to have StringTokenizer as the param type instead.
