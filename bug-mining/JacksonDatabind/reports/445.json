if it is, throw same exception as previous accessors would\r\n    * essentially, `root.required(\"foo\")` would be equivalent to `root.path(\"foo\").require()` (except for slightly different error message)\r\n    * returns `this`\r\n* `requireNonNull()`: similarly to `require()`, but also throw exception if \"this\" is `NullNode` (returns `true` for `isNull()`)\r\n\r\nSo: these could improve `JsonNode` ergonomics a lot.\r\n\r\nThere are obviously many more we could consider (for example, whole set of `requireInt()` or such), but I think incremental improvements are a good way to go here.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
