will serialize the payload just fine, even though it reports that it cannot:\n\n``` java\nSystem.out.println(converter.getObjectMapper().canSerialize(EmptyModel.class));\nSystem.out.println(converter.getObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(em));\nSystem.out.println(converter.getObjectMapper().canSerialize(EmptyModel.class));\n```\n\n```\nfalse\n{}\nfalse\n```\n\nAlso, related to bug #703 , with version 2.5.1, the result is:\n\n```\nfalse\n{}\ntrue\n```\n\nI haven't had time to trace down what is enabling the actual serialization to go through on writeValueAsString, but I can try to comment later on this.
