This is covered pretty well.\r\n  - Overriding annotations globally.  It would be really great to have a _general_ mechanism for this. Sometimes you don't control the POJOs, and sometimes you just need different behaviour in different contexts. The annotations are great, but they can only say one thing. Conversely you can easily have many different serialisers for varying requierments. Also, the POJOs are sometimes much more 'distant' from you feature code than your (de)serializer.

made the generated YAML files a lot less readable, but fixed #1714. I did some investigation, and it seems like our issue is caused by a bug in Jackson. The bug was still present in version 2.9.10, but fixed in 2.10.0.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following:\r\n1. Revert the temporary fix for #1714 prepared by @rohanKanojia.\r\n1. Introduce Jackson BOM to get dependency management on Jackson dependencies\r\n1. Upgrade Jackson to the latest release (2.10.0)\r\n1. Add dependency management for snakeyaml. Jackson requires a newer version than the default managed version by Maven (because of docker-maven-plugin).\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to fix the last issue/change. Please advice if you want me to do something else. I.e. exclude the transitive dependency pulled in by the dependency to docker-maven-plugin.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin/issues/1725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin/issues/1725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3225336711,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzIyNTMzNjcxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/3225336711","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-12T18:25:10Z","label":{"name":"2.11","color":"71d151"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3225336712,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyMjUzMzY3MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/3225336712","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-12T18:25:10Z","label":{"name":"3.x","color":"20aa61"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15627565680,"node_id":"LE_lADOAC5e2c4MrIaIzwAAAAOjebpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/15627565680","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-12T02:19:47Z","label":{"name":"3.0","color":"80E086"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15627565956,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAC5e2c4MrIaIzwAAAAOjebuE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/15627565956","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/rep
