Although I can fix this problem, unfortunately there is bit of collision with issue #96. Fundamental problem is this: no type information is ever written for so-called natural types (Integer, Boolean, String, Double). So lack of type information may be due to this, or due to other reasons. This becomes problem when deserializing and there is a defaultImpl specific, and serialized value is scalar (JSON String, Boolean or Number) -- if so, it is not possible to know for sure whether `defaultImpl` type ought to be used, or one of natural types.\n\nIn theory it would be possible to solve this by forcing inclusion of type information even for natural type values, on serialization, when 'defaultImpl' is defined. Unfortunately this piece of information is not available during serialization call, and it does not seem feasible to (try to) make it passed through.\n\nAs such, I will fix this issue, but it may become problematic for some cases of `defaultImpl` that could be deserializer from scalar types. But we'll cross that bridge if it becomes problematic (could have a Feature to specify which behavior to use or such).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/12450108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":34920660,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ5MjA2NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/34920660","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"a795fa2b56ed3632143908afbc13aa2ce59a1410","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/a795fa2b56ed3632143908afbc13aa2ce59a1410","created_at":"2013-01-19T04:05:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
