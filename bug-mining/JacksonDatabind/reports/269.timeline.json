comment here; I do not think this feature should fail for `List<Integer>`, as `Integer` is not primitive but a wrapper. While I understand while it sometimes would be nice (given that Java does not allow `List<int>`), it would be misnomer, and specifically confusing if it didn't apply to stand-alone wrapper values. Further, if it did apply to stand-alone values, it would be unintuitive as major usage reason for `Integer` over `int` is specifically to allow nulls.\n\nAnyway; I consider this to only apply for `int[]`
