Please describe.**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAbility to deep merge two `JsonNode` objects, and/or to deserialize a stream by updating an existing `JsonNode` rather than creating a new one.\r\n\r\n**Usage example**\r\n```java\r\n    var mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n    var node1 = mapper.readTree(\"{\\\"root\\\":{\\\"a\\\":\\\"aaa\\\",\\\"foo\\\":\\\"hello\\\"}}\");\r\n    var node2 = mapper.readerForUpdating(node1)\r\n        .readTree(\"{\\\"root\\\":{\\\"b\\\":\\\"bbb\\\",\\\"foo\\\":\\\"goodbye\\\"}}\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/584 implies that this capability exists, but it does not appear to be functioning propery for `JsonNode`.  There also doesn't seem to be a way to specify shallow or deep merge using the tree API `readerForUpdating()`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
