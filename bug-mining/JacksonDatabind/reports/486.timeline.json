Thanks for the reply. I added two sections on behaviour and an example just in case my intentions weren't sufficiently clear.\r\n\r\n~~@GedMarc I'm going to assume you're referring to using the `toString` function combined with `WRITE_ENUMS_USING_TO_STRING`? That's great but not useful when you have multiple valid values that map to one Enum value. Right now you have to use @JsonCreator to create a stactic factory method which maps those multiple values onto a single value in the Enum. So you're annotating whilst also writing a lot of bloat-code to check if the value you receive matches one of the Enum values.~~\r\n\r\n~~There's computation cost associated with looping through all of your Enum values and I feel that, since you're using annotations anyway during Deserialization (@JsonCreator), Jackson could do a much better job optimizing that code. Whilst also getting rid of all the bloat-code in the enum. EDIT: Just read your comment, scratch my

So, I guess all I am saying is that suggestion is consistent with \"main\" `@JsonAlias` use case: just additional value accepted on deserialization, not used on serialization. Whether such feature should be used instead of alternative is something I won't comment since there are so many possible use cases, some better than others.\r\n\r\nSo in that sense I think request makes sense, and I'd be especially happy to help if anyone wants to implement this. I'll probably eventually get to this myself too, but that may be a while.\r\n\r\nAnd as to performance; if implemented by Jackson, annotations are only processed once, to build deserializer, and not every time deserialization occurs. Annotation access is pretty poorly optimized by JDK so anything that has to do it on the fly incurs pretty severe performance penalty.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/501358085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/504411777","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2352#issuecomment-504411777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2352","id":504411777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDQxMTc3Nw==","user":{"login":"RobertDiebels","id":694779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/694779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels","html_url":"https://github.com/RobertDiebels","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertDiebels/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T12:43:02Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T12:43:02Z","body":"@cowtowncoder I'd be happy to take a crack at it.

I looked at your suggestions for where I could find the alias definitions. Afaics the `BeanDescription` is available when: \r\n\r\n- The `EnumDeserializer` is constructed in `BasicDeserializerFactory->createEnumDeserializer()`. \r\n- The `EnumResolver` is constructed in `BasicDeserializerFactory->_createEnumKeyDeserializer()`.\r\n\r\nThe `EnumDeserializer` itself has no internal access to a `BeanDescription`.\r\n\r\nI tried finding a different way to retrieve the aliases by doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. I tried to retrieve an `AnnotationInspector` via the `DeserialiazationContext`. This failed due to the unavailability of a JavaType that matches an allowed type. Resulting in unavailability of the `Annotated` members of an Enum class.\r\n2. I tried to add the aliases as valid enum values in the `EnumResolver`. This failed as I could not pass the `AnnotationInspector` any values. Due to unavailability of the `Annotated` members of the Enum class.\r\n\r\nI think I might be able to get this in by adding a constructor to the `EnumResolver` and pass it the aliases. Letting the `EnumDeserializer` retrieve the aliases from the `EnumResolver`. \r\nThis would: \r\n\r\n- Prevent major changes to the `EnumDeserializer` itself. \r\n- Seems like a logic place to put the aliases since the `defaultValue` is also present in the `EnumResolver`. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think since I'm not sure that's the right way to go about it.
