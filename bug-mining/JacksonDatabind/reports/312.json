StdDateFormat serializes datetimes without colon in the timezone offset, eg. `1970-01-01T01:00:00.123+0100`.\r\n\r\nJava8 and Joda have decided to include a colon in the offset, eg `1970-01-01T01:00:00.123+01:00`.\r\n\r\nAlthough Joda accepts to deserialize a datetime with or without the colon, Java8 considers the colon as mandatory and fails to deserialize datetimes produced Jackson's StdDateFormat.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some platforms like iOS also require a colon in the offset and are therefore also unable to read dates produces by Jackson's StdDateFormat.\r\n\r\n*Consequence:* It would be nice if Jackson's StdDateFormat could be easily configured, extended or customized to include a colon in the timezone offset.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1744/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
