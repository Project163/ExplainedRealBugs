TypeFactory (instantiated using with... method) should have a new TypeParser which points to itself.\n\nI've created the issue https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/894 to explain the situation.\nSince it's a catch-22 situation because a new TypeFactory has a TypeParser which has to point to itself, I had to change TypeParser variable _parser on TypeFactory not to be final and create a (private method) setter to set the new TypeParser. I hope it's ok with you this way.\nThe new TypeParser works correctly only if using the newly created TypeFactory (when it's a ClassLoader issue) because the original TypeFactory doesn't have it.\nI'd love to see this included in the next release because we're using 2.6.1 in production now and this problem forces us to continue with the Thread switch hack to allow finding the class.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/895/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":383074180,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4MzA3NDE4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/383074180","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a7b26ebf2983432b64c120fcf09b4d294748e081","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/a7b26ebf2983432b64c120fcf09b4d294748e081","created_at":"2015-08-14T23:34:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":383074206,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDM4MzA3NDIwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/383074206","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-14T23:34:26Z","milestone":{"title":"2.6.2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":383074249,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzgzMDc0MjQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/383074249","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"a7b26ebf2983432b64c120fcf09b4d294748e081","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/a7b26ebf2983432b64c120fcf09b4d294748e081","created_at":"2015-08-14T23:34:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/131267443","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/894#issuecomment-131267443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/894","id":131267443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTI2NzQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/
