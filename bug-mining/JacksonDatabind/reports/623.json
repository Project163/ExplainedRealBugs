updating from jackson 2.13.1 to jackson 2.13.2 I noticed my app no longer worked on Android API 21.\r\n\r\nAfter digging into the code I found the issue at line 187 of `AnnotatedMethodCollector.java`:\r\n- version 2.13.1 used `m.getParameterTypes().length`\r\n- version 2.13.2 uses `m.getParameterCount()`\r\n\r\nHowever, the [getParameterCount()](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/reflect/Method#getParameterCount()) method requires API 26 on Android.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'm sticking to version 2.13.1 😄
