Recompilation solve this but that would not necessarily happen for transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow, I agree that this is not useful in its current state. One possibility would be to try to use work around like\r\n\r\n`<A extends JsonNode> withArray() { .... }`\r\n\r\nwhich I think results in same signature (since generics are sort of hidden) and might improve usage.\r\n\r\nJackson 3.0 can change signature itself.
