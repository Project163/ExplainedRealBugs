While this used to work acceptably, with 2.7 there is need to properly resolve generic types, and for this `AnnotatedClass` is really needed.\nNow: while it is technically possible to construct `AnnotatedClass` from `JavaType` (and must be done before changes), an instance is already available at the point when method is called, so it would make sense to just pass it. Or, given that the object actually available is `BeanDescription` (and impl `BasicBeanDescription`), let's just pass that.\n\nEarlier method needs to be deprecated and new one added, although I guess we could (if absolutely necessary) alternatively add method in 2.7, only deprecated 2.8. But that may be unnecessary caution.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1027/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
