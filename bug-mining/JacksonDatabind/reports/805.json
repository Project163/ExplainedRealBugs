to `Deserializers` methods, `Serializers` is missing callbacks to 2 special types:\n\n* Enums\n* \"tree node\" subtypes (`TreeNode`)\n\nand generic `Serializers.findSerializer()` (since no more specific callback exists) is called.\n\nIn addition, `Deserializers` uses too specific limit for \"tree nodes\" (`JsonNode`, should be `TreeNode`).\n\nSince adding new callbacks is major backwards-compatibility change with some possibility of breakage, let's add callbacks only in 3.0 (ditto for signature change for `Deserializers.findTreeNodeDeserializer()`\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/5169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
