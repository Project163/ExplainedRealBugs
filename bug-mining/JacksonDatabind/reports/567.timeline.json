Same thing with a `NullCreatorPropertyException`, and so on. (None of these type names is supposed to be final, just examples.)\r\nIf these new exception types derive from the exception types that are currently thrown (like `MismatchedInputException`, `PropertyBindingException`, and so on), then this also wouldn't break backwards compatibility, right? Callers which are currently catching those types can continue to do so, or they can update their code to catch the new, more specific exception types and gain access to the error information those have.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what I could contribute to this issue unfortunately.
