I believe this issue was tracked and resolved upstream with details found [here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4435).\r\n\r\nIt looks like the `jackson-databind` patch `2.17.1` with the fix was already included in Quarkus `3.11.1`. I did upgrade to `3.11.1` and found the issue solved. Any chance you'd consider bringing this fix into the latest LTS branch `3.8` as well? \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nA contract with field set correctly.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException: Cannot deserialize value of type `java.math.BigDecimal` from String \".2\": not a valid representation\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nSee linked issue for a better example.
