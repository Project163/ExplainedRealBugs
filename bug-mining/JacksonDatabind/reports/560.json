the bug**\r\n\r\nThe removal of a checked exception from the signature of `ObjectMapper#treeToValue()` introduced via #2805 is a source-breaking change, as any code attempting to `catch` that checked exception will no longer compile.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.12.0-rc1\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry {\r\n  new ObjectMapper().treeToValue(tree);\r\n} catch (JsonProcessingException e) { // <- exception com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException is never thrown in body of corresponding try statement\r\n  throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nExpected code that builds fine against Jackson 2.11 to continue building with 2.12.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis appears to breach [Apache Versioning](https://apr.apache.org/versioning.html) convention, which Jackson claims to enforce:
