fix went in `2.18` branch last night so only the latest 2.18.2-SNAPSHOT should have it.\r\n\r\n@jmesny So how does your example differ from test I added? Test was failing before, passing after fix. It is possible there may be remaining edge case(s) but I'd need a reproduction.\r\nThe only difference I see is use of `ImplicitNameIntrospector` because `jackson-databind` cannot depend on parameter-names module; but that should work identically (and is used by many other tests).\r\n\r\nSo I'd need to be able to reproduce remaining problems; can't do it
