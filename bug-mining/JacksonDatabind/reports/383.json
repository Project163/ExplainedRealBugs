That's bad because I tell Jackson that the 'type' is 'ConcreteClass.class' so I want that Jackson tolerates the missing 'type' property. In other words: Please use the given class as 'defaultImpl' (see JsonTypeInfo attribute defaultImpl) if no JsonTypeInfo defaultImpl attribute was set but a concrete class was given.\n\nOr is there another way to define a 'defaultImpl' when using readValue()?\n\nThank you!\n\nExample:\n\n``` java\n@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.MINIMAL_CLASS, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = \"type\")\npublic interface MyInterface {\n  String getName();\n  void setName(String name);\n}\n\npublic class MyClass implements MyInterface {\n  private String name;\n  public String getName() {\n    return name;\n  }\n  public void setName(String name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis works:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"name\",\n  \"type\": \".MyClass\"\n}\n```\n\n``` java\nobjectMapper.readValue(jsonString, MyInterface.class);\n```\n\nThis not (but it would be very nice if you can make it work):\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"name\"\n}\n```\n\n``` java\nobjectMapper.readValue(jsonString, MyClass.class);\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/955/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
