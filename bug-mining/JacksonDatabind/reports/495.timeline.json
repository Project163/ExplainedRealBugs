There are indeed a few places where leading character(s) are being lower cased, in addition to the code that tries full lower-casing you mention. I'll see if I can figure out a way to tease the problem, although I assume it would require use of the specific letter(s) to have effect, as well as override of the default locale.\n\nI wonder, however, if the turkish handling would be desired in some cases? Since context objects (`SerializerProvider`, `DeserializationContext`) have configured `Locale` (accessible via `getLocale()`), perhaps it would make sense to use that instead of the default system Locale?\nThen again, as things are this will be taken from `Locale.getDefault()`. But at least it would then be possible to force it to something else. It would also be possible to change the default `Locale` for Jackson for 2.7.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/144474030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/161872563","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/953#issuecomment-161872563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/953","id":161872563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTg3MjU2Mw==","user":{"login":"cbsmith","id":418385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODM4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/418385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith","html_url":"https://github.com/cbsmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbsmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-04T04:29:39Z","updated_at":"2019-11-28T22:24:14Z","body":"I love it.

to fix Turkish i parsing https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/953#event-813678035.\r\n\r\nSo the idea behind this fix is to propagate a proper Locale that user set during `ObjectMapper` configuration. This way, the user can decide if he wants to parse in a particular Locale. \r\n\r\nThere's another consequence as well, previously, because the Json readers are cached, we could end up in a state when `Locale.getDefault()` is different than it was during reader creation. So the same reader would fail during parsing of the exact same Json it tried to parse before. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n1. Set Turkish locale\r\n2. Parse to `Bean.class` having uppercase I in the property name\r\n3. Set UK locale\r\n4. Parse `Bean.class` again\r\n5. Parsing fails\r\n\r\nI deliberately didn't create unit tests for classes that use `toLowerCase(locale)`, and decided to test the whole `ObjectMapper` integrated with real implementations of those.\r\n\r\nApologies if I didn't follow some other conventions of the project, or if I'm targetting the wrong
