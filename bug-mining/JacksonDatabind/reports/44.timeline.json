change https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/565 has overridden the default behavior that is defined by annotations when using JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT.  This is problematic if the Map.Entry is only one aspect of the object.  Below is example code that exposes this defect.  It represents an attempt to implement the pre Jackson-2.5 behavior for a Map.Entry by forcing the jackson to deal with object as a POJO.  But instead of reading the annotations as if it were a POJO it appears to serialize as by using some default Map.Entry algorithm. The behavior is not as expected after annotating the class.

\r\nOk, thanks! I have another question. \r\n\r\nIf we upgrade to version 2.8.x, in order to support backwards compatibility with data that was generated with pre 2.5 for collection of Map.Entry, you mentioned implementing a custom serializer for Map.Entry is the way to go. That is easy to do, and we were able to do that, however what we are struggling with is implementing a deserializer to do the same, specially given that we may have a convoluted object (the value in a Map.Entry may be another map of objects for example etc.).\r\n\r\nCan you point us to an easy solution on implementing the deserializer for Map.Entry (by falling back to / reusing other serializers?) or any other way of maintaining the old (pre 2.5) behaviour, if we upgrade to Jackson 2.8.x?\r\n\r\nThanks!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/301063193/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ivascaflavius","id":3653270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTMyNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3653270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius","html_url":"https://github.com/ivascaflavius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivascaflavius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1079885878,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTA3OTg4NTg3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1079885878","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-12T12:27:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1079885879,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwNzk4ODU4Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/1079885879","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-12T12:27:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/317450343","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/565#issuecomment-317450343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/565","id":317450343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzQ1MDM0Mw==","user":{"login":"pedro93","id":3718654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTg2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3718654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93","html_url":"https://github.com/pedro93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.
