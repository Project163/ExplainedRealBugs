I write a Jackson filtering library and I count on the current value being correct.\r\n\r\nDoing some digging, I noticed that the StringCollectionSerializer sets the currentValue in the serialize method like so:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\n    public void serialize(Collection<String> value, JsonGenerator g,\r\n            SerializerProvider provider) throws IOException\r\n    {\r\n        g.setCurrentValue(value);\r\n        final int len = value.size();\r\n        if (len == 1) {\r\n            if (((_unwrapSingle == null) &&\r\n                    provider.isEnabled(SerializationFeature.WRITE_SINGLE_ELEM_ARRAYS_UNWRAPPED))\r\n                    || (_unwrapSingle == Boolean.TRUE)) {\r\n                serializeContents(value, g, provider);\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        g.writeStartArray(len);\r\n        serializeContents(value, g, provider);\r\n        g.writeEndArray();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the current value is not explicity set  in IndexedStringListSerializer nor CollectionSerializer, and consequently they both don't exhibit this problem\r\n\r\nI have attached a java class that exhibits this behavior as long as you're using Jackson version 2.9.9 or later\r\n[Test.java.zip](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/3655838/Test.java.zip)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
