follow up for https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/80)\r\n\r\nSo, Kotlin generates its property accessors, fields similar to (but not identical) Bean conventions:\r\n\r\nhttps://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-to-kotlin-interop.html\r\n\r\nand as a result Jackson's default introspection has some trouble, in particular for \"is getters\".\r\nWhile there is now a patch for Kotlin, it might make sense to add a `MapperFeature` to enable it at lower level -- both for being bit more optimal, and to avoid possible regression when databind introspection changes in future (for 3.0 in particular).\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2527/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
