I originally found this issue in jackson-databind 2.10.0, but it still exists in 2.11.0. \r\nI have an enum that implements an interface:\r\n\r\n    @JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.NAME)\r\n    public interface CustomEnum {}\r\n\r\n    @JsonTypeName(\"Test\")\r\n    public enum TestEnum implements CustomEnum {\r\n        VALUE;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen, this test case works fine:\r\n\r\n    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n    mapper.registerSubtypes(TestEnum.class);\r\n\t\t\r\n    mapper.enable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_INVALID_SUBTYPE);\r\n\t\t\r\n    CustomEnum testValue = TestEnum.VALUE;\r\n    String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(testValue);\r\n\t\t\r\n    CustomEnum deserializedValue = mapper.readValue(json, CustomEnum.class);\r\n    assertEquals(testValue, deserializedValue);\r\n\r\nHowever, when I disable the feature, the test case fails because `deserializedValue` is suddenly `null`. The reason seems to be that a `NullyfingDeserializer` is returned from `TypeDeserializerBase._findDefaultImplDeserializer(...)` instead of `null`. Therefore, the `AsPropertyDeserializer` no longer tries to read the value itself.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2775/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2775/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
