The last version working with my code is the 2.8.10 as far as I know.\r\nThe problem I see is that the serialization checks in file `jackson-databind-2.9.5-sources.jar!/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/type/TypeFactory.java:474` while I would expect the check to make sure that the field-type is only assignable-from the concrete instance of a field.\r\n\r\nI prepared a testcase which I attach to this report.\r\n\r\n[testcase-plugin-serialization.zip](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/2469664/testcase-plugin-serialization.zip)\r\n\r\nThe entry point for my testcase is the class called MyTest. There you find a function\r\n- problem() : producing the problem\r\n- workaround() : working around the problem by doing the serialization in the problematic class manually\r\n\r\nIn the example the ProblematicPlugin has a value type named ValueAndState which implements Serializable. As the serializer checks for Serializable == ValueAndState the check fails while I think the check should do field.isAssignableFrom(valueAndStateInstance).\r\n\r\nThe class WorkaroundPlugin contains my current work around, doing the serialization of the members myself and just bypassing the check in the class itself.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask for a change in the serializer checking for isAssignableFrom(..).\r\n\r\nAny feedback and questions welcome.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
