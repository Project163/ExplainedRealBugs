Consider this test case:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nclass RecordStringDeserializationTest {\r\n\r\n  private static final ObjectMapper OBJECT_MAPPER = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  void deserializeMyValueRecordFromPrimitiveValue() throws Exception {\r\n    assertEquals(new MyValueRecord(\"foo\"), OBJECT_MAPPER.readValue(\"\\\"foo\\\"\", MyValueRecord.class));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  final record MyValueRecord(@JsonProperty String value) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works as expected in `2.11.3`, since `2.12.0` a `MismatchedInputException` is thrown:\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot construct instance of `us.byteb.jackson.RecordStringDeserializationTest$MyValueRecord` (although at least one Creator exists): no String-argument constructor/factory method to deserialize from String value ('foo')\r\n at [Source: (String)\"\"foo\"\"; line: 1, column: 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis still works as expected  if an explicit factory method annotated with `@JsonCreator` is provided for the Record or for an equivalent Class without explicit `@JsonCreator` (see additional [test cases](https://gist.github.com/bfncs/2626ff10830c29e674c6e485bcb7db67)). I would expect the behavior for Records to be the same as for Classes, it also seems contrary to the brevity of Records to have to define an additional factory method.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n`2.12.0`\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSee test case above.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
