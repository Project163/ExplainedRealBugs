It reads each line, tries to parse them to json, and if it fails with an exception, it will print the line instead.\n\nThere's a small mistake in the runtime, where [the buffer is flushed on EOF, even if it is empty](https://github.com/aws/jsii/blob/main/packages/%40jsii/java-runtime/project/src/main/java/software/amazon/jsii/JsiiRuntime.java#L518). This would have failed the json parsing, and printed a newline to standard error (probably no one noticed this - I certainly didn't).\n\nUnfortunately, Jackson-Databind 2.18.3 contains a [change](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4932), where json nodes that aren't present will now return `null` instead of throwing an exception as they did previously. This changes the behaviour for empty string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Regression Issue\n\n- [x] Select this option if this issue appears to be a regression.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo errors to be printed on a successful run\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe following error is printed to standard out\n\n```\nUnexpected error in background thread \"software.amazon.jsii.JsiiRuntime.ErrorStreamSink\": java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read field \"stderr\" because \"consoleOutput\" is null\n```\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nRun any java code that calls jsii with v1.109.0\n\n### Possible Solution\n\nThe fix is twofold:\n\n1) Don't flush an empty buffer on EOF (ie, [this line](https://github.com/aws/jsii/blob/main/packages/%40jsii/java-runtime/project/src/main/java/software/amazon/jsii/JsiiRuntime.java#L519))\n2) Handle a null return from `objectMapper.treeToValue` [here](https://github.com/aws/jsii/blob/main/packages/%40jsii/java-runtime/project/src/main/java/software/amazon/jsii/JsiiRuntime.java#L528)\n\n\n\n### Additional Information/Context\n\nHappy to produce a PR if you like\n\n### SDK version used\n\n1.109.0\n\n### Environment details (OS name and version, etc.)\n\nopenjdk 23.0.1, node v22.9.0, MacOS

upgraded an app that utilizes dxa-tridion-provider:2.3.7 to spring boot 3.4.4 and noticed some interactions in the GraphQLProvider that appear to be tied to behavior introduced in jackson-databind:2.18.3\n\nWhen I receive a response from our Tridion CMS endpoint that has empty or null data for the raw content, (IE: {\"data\":{\"page\":null}}), I receive a null pointer exception.\n\nThis seems to be tied to GraphQLProvider's loadPage method relying on unintended behavior from Jackson, the response is mapped to a MissingNode which prior to 2.18.2 would throw an error when passed to mapToType's treeToValue call. This would signal to the provider to re-try the call with the page request normalized (normalizePathToDefaults) which in our implementation would then succeed.\n\nThis behavior was fixed in [this change](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4932) to Jackson and the Tridion DXA provider now proceeds with a null object which will then fail when attempting to build the page model.\n\nIs this something that's been identified as a fix for the next DXA provider release? Currently I've downgraded Jackson to 2.18.2 for the time being to be able to pull in other dependency upgrades as part of boot 3.4.4.
