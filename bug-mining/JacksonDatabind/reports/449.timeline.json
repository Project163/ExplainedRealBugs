`@JsonTypeName` is used or not depends on whether polymorphic handling is enabled, and if it is, how are types found; but for polymorphic deserialization things happen in 2 steps: first, information for relevant base type is processed (to know info for subtypes etc), and then when type id is resolved, deserializer for actual implementation is located. But even in latter case, annotations are \"flattened\" from full type hierarchy. Not sure if that is relevant but thought I'll write it down to help me think this through :)\r\n\r\nNow, one known issue with Jackson 2.x is that handling of \"regular\" properties, and those from Creator, is somewhat split, and there are certain cases where information is not available in fully resolved form. This is due to auto-detection of Creator methods having bit of chicken-and-egg problem (some auto-discovery relies on correlation between Creator parameter name annotations, annotations on field/getter/setter).\r\n\r\nSo there are some possible gotchas. But I'll need to go through the process to see what is going on.\r\n\r\nBut back to my earlier question:\r\n\r\n    One more suggestion: moving @JsonAlias to matching getter might work
