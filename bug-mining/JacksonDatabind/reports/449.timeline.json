so, for 2.10 I split `Java7Support`/`-Impl` into 4 classes; 2 new ones being `Java7Handlers`/`-Impl`. J7Support now loads annotation part, and J7Handlers serializer/deserializer for `Path` type, and only latter will log anything in case of failure.\r\nSo I think this should work better for J2SE at least.\r\nI'll see if I should change 3.0 a bit as well, to revert merge of annotation access into main part and leave it as

- please do not merge*~~\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds the ability to do command-line releases using the [shadow Gradle plugin](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow).\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew shadowJar\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which will output a file to `\\cli-app\\build\\libs` such as `gtfs-validator-v1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.\r\n\r\nThis file can then be run from the command-line with the normal Java conventions:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava -jar gtfs-validator-v1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -u https://transitfeeds.com/p/mbta/64/latest/download -z input.zip -i input -o output\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the updated `RELEASE.md` file for more details.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Implement basic command line release\r\n- [x] Update release docs\r\n- [x] Add minification - https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/configuration/minimizing/. Original release JAR was 11,090 KB, minified JAR is 6,587 KB.\r\n- [x] Typo in release docs - fix order to `./`\r\n- [x] Change output directory? - No, just output path to compiled JAR to console when building (see comment below)\r\n- [x] Change file name to remove `-all`? Yes\r\n- [x] Fix warning added during minification - see comment below. Fixed in https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/pull/108/commits/506e03f7c1dcf900151c8b630c4405bce5e0c4ed.\r\n- [x] Add \"v\" to version number to match previous releases\r\n- [x] Update usage examples and release docs to printed file output, removed \"-all\"\r\n- [x] Add SNAPSHOT instruction for generating release\r\n- [x] Test again!\r\n\r\nCloses #66, Closes
