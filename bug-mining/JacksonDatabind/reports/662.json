the bug**\r\n\r\n`PrimitiveArrayDeserializers$ByteDeser.deserialize` throws `InvalidFormatException` instead of calling one of the `DeserializationProblemHandler` methods, probably `handleWeirdStringValue`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvalidFormatException: Cannot access contents of TextNode as binary due to broken \r\nBase64 encoding: Illegal character '␡'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n\r\nTested in 2.13.5, but the bug is definitely present in 2.15\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n   public byte[] data;\r\n}\r\n```\r\njson:\r\n```json\r\n{\"data\": \"not a valid base64 string\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expect deserializer to call `handleWeirdStringValue` (or another method of `DeserializationProblemHandler`, if that's more appropriate) instead of just throwing `InvalidFormatException`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3784/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
