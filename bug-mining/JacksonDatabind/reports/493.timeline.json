should quickly get cached, so even with synchronization it would seem odd that it would become bottle-neck, so my first suspicion is usually regarding whether something else is not getting reused.\r\nIn this case, scope of `TypeNameIdResolver` is per-property (or possibly, per-polymorphic class).\r\n\r\nI would not recommend copying `ObjectMapper` as that is as expensive operation is fully creating a new mapper instance, and having separate copy per-thread is rather heavy-weight (due to caching of all (de)serializers).\r\n\r\nHowever: I can change synchronization itself to reduce scope so that (usually successful) lookup, and other processing (introspection of cached id not found, addition to lookup map) are not within same sync block, and use separate sync for put'ing of new value.\r\n\r\nMy main concern is just that I do not have any way to really test this, so if there was a way to test this somehow (like running under profiler) to verify improvement, that'd be great.\r\n\r\nBut I can make a change to get released in 2.10.2 I think; I have made similar changes to synchronized scope in the past, with good
