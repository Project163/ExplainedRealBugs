this in 2.12 for 2.12.3, wrt. \"simple\" cases presented: works by checking that the number of type parameters `JavaType` instance provides matches what declaration of the \"raw class\"

but JavaType's \"raw class\" may be anything else, and could have one unrelated type variable.\r\n\r\nI'll have to think about what to do wrt canonical name in general for 3.0: it is really only ever needed for one quite specific case -- that of `EnumSet`/`EnumMap` handling for polymorphic cases.\r\nIt may be used for other generic polymorphic types but I am bit doubtful that it would actually
