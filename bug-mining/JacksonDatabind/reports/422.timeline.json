See https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2220. As mentioned by @ophelie in this reply, https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-java-tools/issues/240#issuecomment-474903456, it used to work because Jackson ObjectMapper had short circuit logic until 2.9.9. Now file upload breaks in all cases. The same applies for any class whose fields doesn't have Jackson serializer. \r\n\r\nI feel this issue is in `com.coxautodev.graphql.tools.MethodFieldResolver#isScalarType`. It returns false for custom scalar types.\r\n\r\nI added test to replicate the issue here, https://github.com/adisesha/graphql-java-tools/tree/jackson_2_10_0_bug. \r\n\r\nPlease suggest a work around for this. Also let me know if you need any other details. Thanks .

spinnaker/spinnaker#5257\r\n\r\nThe `Stage` constructor was keeping `refId`, `startTimeExpiry` and `requisiteStageRefIds` from the context map argument in its internal context map. This caused issues when a parent stage's context was used to create a child stage, as these entries aren't expected to be inherited. This wasn't a problem for a long time because these values were accidentally removed by the side effect of `StartStageHandler#shouldSkip`. `shouldSkip()` uses `objectMapper.convertValue()` on a stage context expecting to have a cloned map returned. A long standing design/documentation issue with Jackson made `convertValue()` return the input parameter as is instead of converting/cloning it. This made every `Stage` passing through `StartStageHandler.handle()` having their context map indirectly 'corrected' and persisted.\r\nAn upcoming upgrade to Spring Boot 2.2 comes with Jackson 2.10 where `objectMapper.convertValue()` has a new behaviour and would make `shouldSkip()` fail to silently 'correct' the stages context map.\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2220\r\n\r\n`BakeStageSpec` was validating `context['refId']` on the generated contexts but the contexts aren't Stages yet; once a context is made into a Stage and added to the graph (`graph.add`) it will have its `refId` generated based on the parent refId; which isn't under test in that spec.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spinnaker/orca/issues/3359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spinnaker/orca/issues/3359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Logic-32","id":25107222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTA3MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25107222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32","html_url":"https://github.com/Logic-32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T21:01:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T21:01:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2590","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2590/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2590/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2590/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2590","id":548288438,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NDgyODg0Mzg=","number":2590,"title":"Fix
