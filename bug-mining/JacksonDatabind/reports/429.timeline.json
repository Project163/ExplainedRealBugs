cowtowncoder,\r\n\r\nSorry for the late answer. I would use getNullValue(). What you did if I correctly read your commit. \r\n\r\nFor information, I worked around the issue by implementing my custom deserializer getNullValue as follow (Kotlin syntax): \r\n\r\n    override fun getNullValue(ctxt: DeserializationContext): Optional<*>? {\r\n        val referencedNullValue = this._fullType.referencedType\r\n            ?.let { ctxt.findRootValueDeserializer(it) }\r\n            ?.let { it.getNullValue(ctxt) }\r\n        return referenceValue(referencedNullValue)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n@cowtowncoder I think we can provide a default implementation of getNullValue in ReferenceTypeDeserializer<T>. Here my proposal:\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public T getNullValue(DeserializationContext ctxt) {\r\n         return referenceValue(_valueDeserializer.getNullValue(ctxt))\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI would be able to simplify my code later. Thank you for the fix.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/510568222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcoolive","id":2347771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDc3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2347771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive","html_url":"https://github.com/mcoolive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcoolive/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2476620126,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ3NjYyMDEyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2476620126","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-11T16:56:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2476620127,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NzY2MjAxMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2476620127","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-11T16:56:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/550759863","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2303#issuecomment-550759863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2303","id":550759863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDc1OTg2Mw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/recei
