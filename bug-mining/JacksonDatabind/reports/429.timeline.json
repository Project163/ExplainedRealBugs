to multiple CVEs for possible exploits via \"default typing\" (or, `@JsonTypeInfo` with base type of `java.lang.Object`) AND a small set of common \"serialization gadgets\", we have added blacklist of such gadgets. Blacklist is a moving target, with steady trickle of new types, and fundamentally can never be 100% complete.\r\n\r\nInclusion of black list is then problematic in a few ways:\r\n\r\n1. As protection it is unlikely to ever be complete for everybody, everywhere\r\n2. Since it's part of `jackson-databind` (for now at least), update requires new release, update by app/service developers\r\n3. Although there are ways around (2) (by subclassing), those are cumbersome and not well known\r\n\r\nAs to (3), it is worth noting that:\r\n\r\n* Subclassing `BeanDeserializerFactory` (used by databind itself for applying blacklist)\r\n* Custom `Module` (before `DeserializerFactory` is invoked)\r\n* Implementing custom `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.jsontype.impl.ClassNameIdResolver`, even before deserializer, when resolving polymorphic type id as a class\r\n\r\ncan all be used for protection; but are either not module (sub-classing of deserializer factory), or otherwise cumbersome (module, type id resolver).\r\n\r\nBut it should be possible to take another approach: define a new small handler API, to be invoked when:\r\n\r\n1. Resolving subtype to serialize / deserialize\r\n2. Attempting to construct serializer / deserializer\r\n\r\nThis would allow many things, like:\r\n\r\n* Preventing deserialization and/or serialization of types deemed unsafe (or undesired?)\r\n* Changing of type on deserialization (or, for purpose of locating serializer, also serialization?)\r\n\r\none use of which is security check.\r\n\r\nCallback(s) could then:\r\n\r\n* translate type as-is, for \"that's fine\"\r\n* substitute type (subtype for deserialization; supertype for serialization)\r\n* throw exception to indicate that type is illegal to serialize/deserialize\r\n\r\nIn theory it might even be possible to perhaps allow some special handling like \"always deserialize as null\"; but at this point this is speculation.\r\n\r\nAfter defining such handler interface, it should be applied in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. For default typing, REQUIRE passing of such validator. While default implementation (\"just block known serialiation gadgets\") should be available, it SHOULD NOT be passed implicitly. Caller must pass it, to document their choice.\r\n2. For `@JsonTypeInfo` approach, a new property, with default choice, should suffice. Here defaulting should be ok since exploit only applies to case of `java.lang.Object` (and perhaps `java.io.Serializable`, `java.util.Comparable`?)\r\n    * possibly require non-default choice for `java.lang.Object` et al?\r\n\r\nand then polymorphic handler would need to be passed validator to use.\r\n\r\nNet effect of this would be to allow finer-grained control of blocking certain types from polymorphic handling (esp. deserialization).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson3-dev/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson3-dev/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"meeque","id":901490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTQ5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/901490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque","html_url":"https://github.com/meeque","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meeque/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-13T16:38:24Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T16:38:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2208","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2208/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2208/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2208/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2208","id":390752561,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTA3NTI1NjE=","number":2208,"title":"Allow

the past Jackson Databind has had numerous vulnerabilities that were related to polymorphic deserialization. In particular, many classes turn out to be insecure when deserialized from untrusted data. These classes are often called deserialization gadgets. \r\n\r\nJackson Databind has addressed such vulnerabilities by maintaining a [black-list of classes that must not be deserialized](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/jackson-databind-2.9.7/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/jsontype/impl/SubTypeValidator.java#L30). However, new classes are often identified to be deserialization gadgets, and [the black-list needs to be extended frequently](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Acve+polymorphic).\r\n\r\nRight now (checked on 2.9.7 sources and on master) there is no convenient way for users of Jackson Databind to extend the black-list. In particular, users would have to either modify the Jackson Databind sources or re-implement several classes of Jackson Databind.\r\n\r\nInstead, it would be great if users could extend the blacklist by means of configuration. This would have the following benefits:\r\n\r\n* Users can black-list their own classes that might be deserialization widgets. \r\n(If such classes are not published as open source, it is unlikely that they will ever make it on the built-in black-list that is maintained by Jackson Databind.)\r\n* When new classes are added to the built-in black-list that is maintained by Jackson Databind, users can adjust their own black-list accordingly. \r\n(This may be important for users who cannot readily upgrade to the latest Jackson Databind release. It can also help closing the time-gap between classes being proposed for the built-in black-list and an actual release that contains the updated black-list.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T01:16:03Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T01:16:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2231","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2231/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2231/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2231/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2231","id":402013149,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDIwMTMxNDk=","number":2231,"title":"Security

a downstream project that depends on Jackson, Jackson's default typing feature is a PITA. The feature, by design, enables remote code execution. Personally I don't understand how all these CVE vulnerabilities that essentially say \"Jacksons remote code execution feature allows remote code execution\" come to exist, they aren't vulnerabilities, they are Jackson working exactly as documented and intended. But it causes a pain for us because every time a new way to use Jacksons remote code execution feature to execute remote code is found, we get multiple notifications from people using and auditing our dependencies saying \"OMG! PLAY FRAMEWORK HAS A SECURITY VULNERABILITY\". And surely given the incredibly wide use of Jackson, we're not the only project that feels this.\r\n\r\nI think the feature should be removed from the core of Jackson databind. Perhaps the necessary plug in points to make it possible to implement the feature by a separate module could be left behind, this would ensure that the people that really need the ability to shoot themselves in the foot still can - is there a Darwin awards for IT security? But this wouldn't just make things easier for us (and Jackson itself), it will also protect users that don't realise just how dangerous the feature is, because it will introduce friction, they won't just be able to discover and enable the method, they'll have to actually add a new dependency. Preferably the module would not even be related to FasterXML, so that automated scans and other reports wouldn't associate the CVEs reported against it with sensible use of Jackson.

For example:\r\n\r\n* `BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder().allowIfBaseType(\"com.fasterxml.\").build()`\r\n    * would allow all values of polymorphic properties where declared base type is in `com.fasterxml` package\r\n* `BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder().allowIfSubType(MyType.class).build()`\r\n    * would allow all polymorphic values that are `MyType` or its sub-class\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/497567713/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2379888591,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM3OTg4ODU5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2379888591","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"535b1dca6d4a855626d65f8270717b1b68043b10","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/535b1dca6d4a855626d65f8270717b1b68043b10","created_at":"2019-05-31T04:12:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
