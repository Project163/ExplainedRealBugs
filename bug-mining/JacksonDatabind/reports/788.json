Please describe.\n\nJackson 2.12 introduced the \"always break when trying to serialize java.time objects without the JavaTimeModule` behavior.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this breaks our 1M+ line codebase which makes ObjectMappers all over the place. And we have client applications that expect the (terrible) POJO format for some time objects.\r\n\r\nIt looks like you've already thought about this with your comment here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/e230f61b05f69cba74f933bd74479b7d764fa9d5/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ser/BeanSerializerFactory.java#L885\r\n\r\nWe've pinned jackson to 2.11.4 across the board but this is not a sustainable solution.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIdeally, a system property that restores the old behavior - let java.time.* be serialized as objects. A distant second would be a feature to enable on the objectmapper which restores old behavior. That would require hunting down every possible objectmapper creation in our codebase, which will hurt.\n\n### Usage example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4533/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
