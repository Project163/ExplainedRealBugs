new feature to \"revert\" behavior change in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1570\r\n\r\ne.g. define a new *SerializationFeature.WRITE_MAP_KEY_ENUMS_USING_INDEX* (or whatever you think is appropriate), when it is set to false while SerializationFeature.WRITE_ENUMS_USING_INDEX is true, enum values are serialised as int (enum ordinal), enum key are serialised as string(enum name)\r\n\r\nWhy need this:\r\n1)  Json's key is always string type,  it is counterintuitive to write enum to a string of number\r\n2)  Compatibility, many json library are unable to deserialize Map<Enum, Object> from this style {\"n_index\",\"any\"}, including current Jackson see
