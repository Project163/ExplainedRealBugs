But general-purpose type variable resolution is incomplete due to complexity of reliably doing so. 2.6 and earlier had much simpler handling, where these particular cases did work, but it was otherwise limited (so, for example, type parameter names and positions through hierarchy had to match -- usually this is true, but not always).

I have json that looks like\n\n```\n{\n  \"something\": [\n        {\n           \"id\": \"a uuid\",\n           \"property\": \"value\"\n         }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd I have a java pojo with an annotation like this:\n\n```\n    @JsonDeserialize(as = MyHashMap.class)\n    private void setSomething(Map<UUID, Foo> incomingValue) {\n```\n\nWhere MyHashMap.java has some custom logic using generics that allow us to map the array json above into a Map where \"id\" is the key and everything else serializes into the value.  We use generics on MyHashMap to enforce that every value implements a certain interface that respects the contract of returning an \"id\" property.  In this example Foo.java implements this interface MyCustomIdInterface.java.\n\nWhen using 2.6.6 this worked fine, but if I switch to 2.7.x then it breaks with the error:\n\n`Can not construct instance of MyCustomIdInterface, problem: abstract types either need to be mapped to concrete types, have custom deserializer, or be instantiated with additional type information`\n\nin 2.7.x, it looks like jackson resolves to using AbstractDeserializer based on MyCustomIdInterface but in 2.6.6 it resolves to using BeanDeserializer based on Foo.java.\n\nIs this a bug or is there some default/feature flag that changed here?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-13T22:44:07Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T22:44:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1604","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1604/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1604/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1604/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1604","id":221499431,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMjE0OTk0MzE=","number":1604,"title":"Nested
