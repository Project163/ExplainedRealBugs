They are ignored for immutable ones. This issue originates from #4351.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nAt least 2.14 - 2.16.1, likely since much longer\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nExplanatory unit tests, as well as a **potential fix**, are part of my PR #4357.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCustom `JsonDeserializer`s set via `BeanDeserializerModifier::updateBuilder` shall work for mutable and immutable beans.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_Note:_ My suggested fix does work for this very scenario and doesn't break any of the existing unit tests. However, it may not fix other, related issues with `BeanDeserializerModifier`. Also, as I don't know every single Jackson feature and this part of the code is very delicate and complex, it may interfere with other features.
