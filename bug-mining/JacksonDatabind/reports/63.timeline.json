So it is not a flaw or something to be changed, but rather established convention at this point (although could use more documentation).\nBig part of the reason is that applicability between scalar types and objects is quite different: there is not much confusion for `int` values, since they only match JSON numbers. But Objects would match JSON Objects, and would then prevent use of regular property-based deserialization. As such scalar types are auto-detected, Object- and Array-types not.\n\nAs to precedence between factory method, constructor, that is a judgment call. But at this point it really can not be changed without some explicit configuration setting -- maybe adding a `MapperFeature` would make sense? -- since that would change behavior in backwards-incompatible way, and possibly break existing usage.\n\nI'll have to check what precedence is; and based on that I could add a config feature.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/67726660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/67727655","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/660#issuecomment-67727655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/660","id":67727655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzI3NjU1","user":{"login":"iovesnov","id":6526563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjY1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6526563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov","html_url":"https://github.com/iovesnov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iovesnov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-20T07:10:32Z","updated_at":"2014-12-20T07:10:32Z","body":"I was looking for the serialization features that would define the priority for the factory method or constructor.

am using Jackson 2.12.3 and it seems that Jackson will sometimes take preference for a private constructor over a public static factory method that is annotated with `@JsonCreator`.\r\n\r\nThis example showcases the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.module.paramnames.ParameterNamesModule;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\n\r\npublic class Test {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n        objectMapper.registerModule(new ParameterNamesModule());\r\n        ValueObject valueObject = objectMapper.readValue(\"{\\\"value\\\":\\\"ABC-123\\\"}\", ValueObject.class);\r\n        System.out.println(\"valueObject = \" + valueObject);\r\n        System.out.println(\"----\");\r\n        WrapperObject wrapperObject = objectMapper.readValue(\"{\\\"valueObject\\\":\\\"ABC-123\\\"}\", WrapperObject.class);\r\n        System.out.println(\"wrapperObject = \" + wrapperObject);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class ValueObject {\r\n        private final String value;\r\n\r\n        private ValueObject(String value) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"constructor: \" + value);\r\n            this.value = value;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        public static ValueObject of(String value) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"factory: \" + value);\r\n            return new ValueObject(value);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public String getValue() {\r\n            return value;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class WrapperObject {\r\n        private final ValueObject valueObject;\r\n\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        public WrapperObject(ValueObject valueObject) {\r\n            this.valueObject = valueObject;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public ValueObject getValueObject() {\r\n            return valueObject;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this (on Java 11) outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfactory: ABC-123\r\nconstructor: ABC-123\r\nvalueObject = be.fodjustitie.inventaris.inventarisbackend.Test$ValueObject@2a3b5b47\r\n----\r\nconstructor: ABC-123\r\nwrapperObject = be.fodjustitie.inventaris.inventarisbackend.Test$WrapperObject@799f10e1\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you can see when deserializing `WrapperObject`, the factory is not used which I would not expect given the factory method is annotated with `@JsonCreator`.\r\n\r\nThis might be related to #660 and/or #2135, not sure.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
