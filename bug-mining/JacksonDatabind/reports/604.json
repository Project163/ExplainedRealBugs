the bug**\r\njackson 2.13.0-rc1 has broken deserialization\r\n2.12.4 works fine\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n2.13.0-rc1\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```java\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnoreProperties;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.TypeReference;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport java.util.Collections;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\nimport java.util.Objects;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n        List<TestObject> testData = new ObjectMapper().readValue(\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n                            [\r\n                              {\"name\": \"first entry\"},\r\n                              {\"name\":

  if (testData.size() != 3) throw new RuntimeException(\"Deserialization failed\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)\r\n    public static class TestObject {\r\n        @JsonProperty(\"name\")\r\n        private final String name;\r\n        @JsonProperty(\"dumbMap\")\r\n        private final Map<String, String> dumbMap;\r\n\r\n        @JsonCreator\r\n        public TestObject(@JsonProperty(\"name\") String name,\r\n                          @JsonProperty(\"dumbMap\") Map<String, String> dumbMap) {\r\n            this.name = name;\r\n            this.dumbMap = Objects.requireNonNullElse(dumbMap, Collections.emptyMap());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n3 items are deserialized\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nDeserialization works if:\r\nIf `breaker` array is empty\r\nIf `TestObject` does not have constructor\r\nIf i deserialize into `List` instead of `List<TestObject>`, seems like it reads all entries into `Map`","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
