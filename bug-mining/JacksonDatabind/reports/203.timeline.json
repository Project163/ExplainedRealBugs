Ideally, yes, that should work. It can be considered a bug, although my concern is that it could also become an implementation imposed limit, constraint. It is a flaw at this point I think.\n\nThe challenge, technically, is that use of constructors is complicated (compared to using setters/fields of an object) due to additional buffering: instead of being able to recursively deserialize values, one by one, it is often necessary to buffer everything that is passed via constructor, until actual type is found, to know what to construct, how.\nUse of external ids is itself a complicated process when type id is found from different place than where it would sort of naturally belong, and also requiring buffering. And even polymorphic type handling is tricky, since handling on deserialization goes from base type to subtype, locating handlers and so forth.\n\nSo: yes, looks like a bug. But not something that is necessarily simple to
