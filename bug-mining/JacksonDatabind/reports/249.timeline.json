Not sure why I implemented delegating key deserializer that way; it's wrong -- should not delegate original parser in general, and in this case parser would be wrong due to buffering needed for type id.\nAnyway: better way is to construct bogus `TokenBuffer` as `JsonParser` and add key (that has already been accessed and is passed as the argument), give that parser; it's safer and necessary here.\n\nThank you for reporting this, providing test case!
