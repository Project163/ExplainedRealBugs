Trying to read the result back using `constructFromCanonical` fails with `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot create TypeBindings for class kotlin.collections.EmptyList with 1 type parameter: class expects 0`.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nTested with `2.11.4` and `2.12.2`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSee the following test written in Kotlin:\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass JacksonTypeFactoryTest {\r\n    private val objectMapper = ObjectMapper()\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun `EmptyList type can be converted to canonical string and back`() {\r\n        val canonical = objectMapper.typeFactory.constructType(emptyList<String>().javaClass).toCanonical()\r\n        println(canonical)\r\n        val type = objectMapper.typeFactory.constructFromCanonical(canonical)\r\n        println(type)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun `StringList type can be converted to canonical string and back`() {\r\n        val canonical = objectMapper.typeFactory.constructType(StringList::class.java).toCanonical()\r\n        println(canonical)\r\n        val type = objectMapper.typeFactory.constructFromCanonical(canonical)\r\n        println(type)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun `Non-collection type can be converted to canonical string and back`() {\r\n        val canonical = objectMapper.typeFactory.constructType(ConcreteType::class.java).toCanonical()\r\n        println(canonical)\r\n        val type = objectMapper.typeFactory.constructFromCanonical(canonical)\r\n        println(type)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class StringList : ArrayList<String>()\r\n\r\n    open class ParamType<T>\r\n\r\n    class ConcreteType : ParamType<Int>()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first two tests fail, while the third one succeeds. So it seems to be a problem only with types that extend `Collection`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`TypeFactory` should always produce canonical type names that it can parse again.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAlthough this doesn't seem to be a Kotlin-specific problem, it gains relevance by the fact that Kotlin uses the `EmptyList` class to optimize empty lists.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to [#1415](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1415) but different in that I'm not using `constructCollectionType` here.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
