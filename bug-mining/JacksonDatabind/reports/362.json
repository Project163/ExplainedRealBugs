One of legacy one-off features has been ability to specify a single fallback serializer to be used for `Map` key types for which no key serializer can be located using other facilities, such as pluggable modules.\r\n\r\nBut with combination of much extended standard key serializers and flexibility of `Module`s, this feature seems obsolete by now. Worse, it is part of mutable configuration of `SerializerProvider`, beyond basic blueprint/instance setup that we want to support (where `SerializerProvider [which ought to be named \"SerializationContext\", is per-call state; separate from stable `SerializationConfig`).\r\n\r\nSo: let's eliminate this first. Then we can see what to do with custom null key / null serializer handlers.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1973/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
