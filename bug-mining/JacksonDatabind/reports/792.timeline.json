However, I also understand importance of backwards compatibility in SemVer concept. That's reason why I raised #4109 which (slightly) mitigates the issue without breaking backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nOne idea is that mentioning a potential dead-lock in the deprecated message. It may make risk of using deprecated classes easier to notice.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have no ways to realize that deprecated classes are used unless recompile from the source code, in particular, if those classes are used inside third-party libraries. I initially thought that producing warning log in a constructor of deprecated classes might be helpful but Jackson doesn't have a logger, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it would be great if we can do something to reduce risk of dead-lock issue even if deprecated classes will be maintained in 2.x series.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1747811327/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"takezoe","id":1094760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ3NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe","html_url":"https://github.com/takezoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takezoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/1749258289","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4136#issuecomment-1749258289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4136","id":1749258289,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c5oQ5Ax","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-05T16:23:08Z","updated_at":"2023-10-05T16:23:44Z","body":"@takezoe  Hmmmh.

(and static fields) of `PropertyNamingStrategy` have been deprecated since Jackson 2.12 due to risk of deadlock described in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2715. Since Jackson respect backwards compatibility based on SemVer concept, those classes should be alive in Jackson 2.x.\r\n\r\nHowever the impact of deadlock is significant depending on the use case but we can't notice use of those classes without recompile from the source code, and no chance if those classes are used inside third-party libraries.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is an idea to help users
