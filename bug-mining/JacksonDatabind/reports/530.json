I create a mapper and set `DeserializationFeature.UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS` in order to unwrap the single object in the array but running my test gives `Cannot construct instance of org.cadrake.POJOValue$POJOValueBuilder, problem: object is not an instance of declaring class`. I Stepped through the jackson classes and it looks like when `BuilderBasedDeserializer` calls `deserializeFromArray()` and then passes the result to `finishBuild()`. The object has already been built by the super class and thus when `finishBuild()` uses reflection to call the `build()` method on the actual builder, it is failing because the object is of the target type not the builder type. I have included my example pojo's and test as well below, I generate the boiler plate getters/builder via lombok. I would like to help with a fix as well if this is more than a trivial change.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Getter\r\n@EqualsAndHashCode\r\n@Builder\r\n@JsonDeserialize(builder = ExamplePOJO.ExamplePOJOBuilder.class)\r\npublic class ExamplePOJO {\r\n  private final int id;\r\n  private final String name;\r\n  private final POJOValue value;\r\n\r\n  @JsonPOJOBuilder(withPrefix = \"\")\r\n  public static class ExamplePOJOBuilder {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Getter\r\n@EqualsAndHashCode\r\n@Builder\r\n@JsonDeserialize(builder = POJOValue.POJOValueBuilder.class)\r\npublic class POJOValue {\r\n  private final String subValue;\r\n\r\n  @JsonPOJOBuilder(withPrefix = \"\")\r\n  public static class POJOValueBuilder {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ExamplePOJOSerializationTest {\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testDeserializationAndFail() throws IOException {\r\n    final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n    mapper.enable(DeserializationFeature.UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS);\r\n\r\n    final String serialized = \"{\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"name\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"value\\\": [ {\\\"subValue\\\": \\\"123\\\"} ]}\";\r\n    final ExamplePOJO pojoDeserialized = mapper.readValue(serialized, new TypeReference<ExamplePOJO>() {});\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
