Unfortunately this behavior has other problems for cases where factory method expects `int`.\r\nThere are a few fixed issues in 2.11(.x), changes for which may have changed behavior here (due to rewrite of functionality to work the way intended), for example:\r\n\r\n* #2352\r\n* #2663 \r\n* #2725\r\n\r\nAnother possible improvement might be to allow coercion of number into `@JsonCreator` that takes `String`, but I am bit hesitant to try work on this because the default interpretation of integer numbers for `Enum`s is to use enum index; and if so such a change would probably break other existing usage where String-taking creator is only to be used to match to names, but number should be used as index.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/755516160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4185558436,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NDE4NTU1ODQzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/4185558436","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-08T18:21:59Z","rename":{"from":"problem:

annotated a factory method for an Integer-Enum like so:\r\nhttps://github.com/comlinegmbh/jackson-enum-poc/blob/master/src/main/java/NumberEnum.java\r\n\r\nUsing Integer instead of String as an argument of \"fromValue\" fixes the Problem in both V2.10.1 and V2.11.3.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this code is generated from an openapi schema via swagger-codegen. I will create a similar issue there but want to share this finding here, so you can be beware of it.\r\n\r\nI have also created a small example-project so you can comprehend this issue easily:\r\nhttps://github.com/comlinegmbh/jackson-enum-poc\r\n\r\nSwitching the Version in the pom.xml makes the unit-test succeed.\r\n\r\nFeel free to let me know if this is no bug but the new intended behavior.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3061/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/985749678","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3006#issuecomment-985749678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3006","id":985749678,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c46wViu","user":{"login":"godwinmg","id":10838235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODM4MjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10838235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg","html_url":"https://github.com/godwinmg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/godwinmg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-03T18:49:45Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T18:49:45Z","body":"Is there a workaround for this issue until we get the fix?
