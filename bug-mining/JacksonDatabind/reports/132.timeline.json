Search before asking\r\n\r\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen `DeserializationFeature.ADJUST_DATES_TO_CONTEXT_TIME_ZONE` is enabled and a textual `OffsetDateTime` representation is deserialized, it is adjusted to contextual `TimeZone`. Nice feature by the way.\r\n\r\nBut if no contextual `TimeZone` is set, it is always adapted to `UTC` which IMHO is a bug. I would rather expect the input to be left as it is, as there is no context regarding the time zone and no indication that a specific time zone should be adopted at all.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n2.15.2\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\nvoid offsetDateTimeBackToBack() throws IOException {\r\n\tfinal ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper()\r\n\t\t\t.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule())\r\n\t\t\t// .disable(DeserializationFeature.ADJUST_DATES_TO_CONTEXT_TIME_ZONE)\r\n\t\t\t.disable(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS);\r\n\tfinal OffsetDateTime odt = OffsetDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.now(), ZoneId.of(\"America/New_York\"));\r\n\tfinal OffsetDateTime back = objectMapper.readValue(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(odt), OffsetDateTime.class);\r\n\tassertEquals(odt, back);\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nEdit: Looking at #915, I can follow the reasoning given there falling back to `UTC` implicitly as a default state. I can easily deactivate the feature, I just stumbled across it because it is activated by default. So, if your response is 'works as designed', I am fine with that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/3132227148","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/915#issuecomment-3132227148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/915","id":3132227148,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5e2c66sf5M","user":{"login":"francisoliverlee","id":5908412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee","html_url":"https://github.com/francisoliverlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-29T12:18:58Z","updated_at":"2025-07-29T12:18:58Z","body":"why
