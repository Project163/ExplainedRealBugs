cases. It uses the base to go out of its way to stomp on the generic.\n\nThe comment in AsExternalTypeResolver says something about enums failing if it doesn't stomp.\n\n``` case EXTERNAL_PROPERTY:\n            // null out the base type, this might work around the problem.\n            return new AsExternalTypeDeserializer(null, idRes,\n                    _typeProperty, _typeIdVisible, _defaultImpl);\n\n```\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/226990624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"benson-basis","id":3358159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTgxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3358159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis","html_url":"https://github.com/benson-basis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benson-basis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/227011433","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1270#issuecomment-227011433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1270","id":227011433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzAxMTQzMw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-19T18:06:34Z","updated_at":"2016-06-19T18:06:34Z","body":"I think this would probably apply to other types too.

Assumption is made that since annotation-based approach can only provide type-erased \"raw\" type, this is passed. In your case type resolver can produce fully generic type, and thus dropping that will drop appropriate parameterization.\n\nI'll have to think of how to properly address this, balancing specific fix (simple enough, would solve test as-is) with hope to handle more generic case. I am thinking that perhaps avoiding specialization call in case given type has type parameters would be a reasonable match; I'll see how that
