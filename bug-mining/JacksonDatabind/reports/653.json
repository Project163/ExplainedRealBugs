Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI work on a REST server that uses `PropertyNamingStrategies.SNAKE_CASE` to translate Java property names to JSON field names.\r\nThe application code needs to report errors to the REST client, using the translated property names, but it has only the Java names.\r\n`PropertyNamingStrategies.SNAKE_CASE` does have a `translate` function that does exactly what I need, but it is declared in `NamingBase` while `SNAKE_CASE` is declaredas `PropertyNamingStrategy`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n* Declare `public translate(String)` in `PropertyNamingStrategy`, or\r\n* Declare `PropertyNamingStrategy SNAKE_CASE` as `NamingBase` or `SnakeCaseStrategy`.\r\n\r\n**Usage example**\r\n\r\nCurrent application code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.PropertyNamingStrategies.SnakeCaseStrategy;\r\n...\r\nprivate static SnakeCaseStrategy toSnakeCaseConverter = new SnakeCaseStrategy();\r\n...\r\npropertyName = toSnakeCaseConverter.translate(propertyName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nApplication code after change:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport static com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.PropertyNamingStrategies.SNAKE_CASE;\r\n...\r\npropertyName = toSnakeCaseConverter.translate(propertyName);\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
