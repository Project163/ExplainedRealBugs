The expected result would be:\n\n``` json\n\"array\": [[1, \"one\"], [0, null]]\n```\n\nI tracked the issue down to:\n\n``` java\npackage com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser;\n// ...\npublic class BeanPropertyWriter {\n// ...\n    public void serializeAsColumn(Object bean, JsonGenerator jgen, SerializerProvider prov)\n        throws Exception\n    {\n        Object value = get(bean);\n        if (value == null) { // nulls need specialized handling\n            if (_nullSerializer != null) {\n                _nullSerializer.serialize(null, jgen, prov);\n            } else { // can NOT suppress entries in tabular output\n                jgen.writeNull();\n            }\n        }\n        // otherwise find serializer to use\n        JsonSerializer<Object> ser = _serializer;\n    // ... ...\n```\n\nwhere I suspect there is a missing \"return\", to exit the function once handling of the null value in the dedicated branch is done.\nAs it is now, a null value is first serialized in the dedicated branch (jgen.writeNull()), and then execution continues on the \"normal\" (non-null) path and eventually the value is serialized once again.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
