the problem is probably related to buffering needed by `@JsonCreator`, and linkage of parent context from buffer (which only holds a small set of tokens) to original parser (which has full parent stack). Worse, tokens are first added in buffer, but only replayed later on, with possibly different parent context -- that is, original parser may have been advanced to have different parent stack than when tokens were originally read.\n\nI think what would be best here would be a small (as small as possible) reproduction; I can trouble-shoot parent linkage and see if problem can be fixed, or at least
