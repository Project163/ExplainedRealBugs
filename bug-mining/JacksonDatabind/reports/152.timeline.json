I see, it is not easy to test, and I am not big fan of adding test-only methods.\n\nBut on plus side, I think I was able to figure out what and where to fix. Tests still pass, although that's not necessarily much of a guarantee of nothing breaking in this particular case.\n\nI will do some manual testing to see if I can verify things work as expected now.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/166488848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":498090288,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk4MDkwMjg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/498090288","actor":{"login":"henrikolsson","id":982322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MjMyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/982322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson","html_url":"https://github.com/henrikolsson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-22T02:52:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":498090289,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5ODA5MDI4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/498090289","actor":{"login":"henrikolsson","id":982322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MjMyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/982322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson","html_url":"https://github.com/henrikolsson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrikolsson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-22T02:52:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/166498626","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1049#issuecomment-166498626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1049","id":166498626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjQ5ODYyNg==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":
