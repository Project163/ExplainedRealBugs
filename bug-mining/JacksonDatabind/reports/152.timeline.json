If both did exist from beginning, yes, one or both should be abstract. If my memory serves me, former was there first, and the goal was to let old implementations be invoked by new code, which calls the second method.\n\nSo this is an artifact of versioning, more or less.\n\nAs usual, documentation improvements would be very welcome; I'll leave this open so I'll see if I can improve them, unless someone beats me to it.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/166693857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":498768634,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk4NzY4NjM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/498768634","actor":{"login":"cowwoc","id":633348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzM0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc","html_url":"https://github.com/cowwoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-22T18:13:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":498768635,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5ODc2ODYzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/498768635","actor":{"login":"cowwoc","id":633348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzM0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc","html_url":"https://github.com/cowwoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-22T18:13:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":499178370,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDk5MTc4Mzcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/499178370","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"6fec75fdf074e13937594bfd075796e11cae6a03","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commits/6fec75fdf074e13937594bfd075796e11cae6a03","created_at":"
