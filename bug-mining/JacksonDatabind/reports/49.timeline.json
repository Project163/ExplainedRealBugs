using an existing property as a polymorphic discriminator, I don't want to change the ordering of the generated output but it always appears first.\n\nThe below (Jackson 2.2.1) serializer test fails with:\n\n```\nExpected :{\"colour\":\"red\",\"name\":\"apple\"}\nActual   :{\"name\":\"apple\",\"colour\":\"red\"}\n```\n\nGiven there are minor performance implications of having it \"somewhere\" in the message no one wants this as default behaviour. I think what it comes down to is that lack of something like\n`JsonTypeInfo.As.EXISTING_PROPERTY` instead of just using `@JsonIgnore` on the real property and letting the type system place it at the beginning. \n\n`As.EXISTING_PROPERTY` would explicitly ignore setting of the type field during serialisation and allow the normal serialisation code to populate it as per the rest of the mapper's configuration. It might want to assert that it is set (to the correct value) but I have not thought this aspect through.\n\n``` java\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;\nimport

      // Then:\n        assertEquals(\"{\\\"colour\\\":\\\"red\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"apple\\\"}\", json);\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testDeserializer() throws IOException {\n        //

the above solution by defining the following `@JsonTypeResolver`:\n\n``` java\npublic class ExistingPropertyTypeResolver extends ObjectMapper.DefaultTypeResolverBuilder {\n    public ExistingPropertyTypeResolver() {\n        super(ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Don't serialise type information (we know it is already in the business fields)\n     */\n    public TypeSerializer buildTypeSerializer(SerializationConfig config,\n                                              JavaType baseType, Collection<NamedType> subtypes) {\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-23T17:21:01Z","updated_at":"2014-09-23T17:21:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/263","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/263/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/263/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/263/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/263","id":16789499,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNjc4OTQ5OQ==","number":263,"title":"@JsonTypeInfo

So new tests are needed, perhaps based on existing tests for creator-functionality.\nBut I can help with tests too, if there's at a test or two to verify happy case, including round-trip (serialize, then deserialize back) test.\n\nFor what it is worth, this is a REALLY important feature, and should go in 2.5.

I've taken a stab at writing the tests.  There is round-trip serialization for three scenarios: (1) sub-classes each have the type property (no reference in base class), (2) sub-classes each have getType() method implemented but no explicit property, and (3) base class has abstract getType() method that enforces sub-classes to have that method.  All three of them have working round trip test cases.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help complete adding this feature to jackson-databind.
