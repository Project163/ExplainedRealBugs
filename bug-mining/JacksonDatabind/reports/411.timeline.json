This also definitely justifies open modules until version 3.\r\n\r\njava.lang is part of the java.base module, But it is also strictly named. \r\nCurrently, in order to run these you have one of two options (Because they are not/never going to 'opens java.lang' in the java.lang module)\r\n \r\n1) You can append ``` --add-opens java.base/java.lang=com.fasterxml.jackson.databind ``` which is the strict module name, and the mechanism for downwards exposure. This has been simplified by creating an @arguments file, and executing that way. This is the Strict JPMS Encapsulation, and is where all the performance boosts come from\r\n\r\n2) This one I like currently, and I'll explain how it works and doesn't destroy the module pathing after\r\n```\r\nopen module com.mypackage.myapp {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis does a few things but I'm only going to highlight the features, \r\n\r\n1) The java.base module is now com.mypackage.myapp, and your classes and libraries have been placed in the parent parent module layer. No changes between JRE 8 and JPMS will be felt (so long as your libraries are named. In automatic/unnamed/classpath mode, the module pathing is disabled. \r\n2) java.lang, java.xml, etc etc, as well as all your packages are opened and exported by default (allowing private field and class handlers like annotations/databind to do its thing without explicit definitions.\r\n3) The module pathing is still adhered to, and any other *named* libraries (except yours, because it is now java.base) will still be strictly enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/444941561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GedMarc","id":5367513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjc1MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5367513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc","html_url":"https://github.com/GedMarc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2010365241,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjAxMDM2NTI0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2010365241","actor":{"login":"arguments","id":6960310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjAzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6960310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments","html_url":"https://github.com/arguments","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-06T16:45:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2010365243,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwMTAzNjUyNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2010365243","actor":{"login":"arguments","id":6960310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjAzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6960310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments","html_url":"https://github.com/arguments","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arguments/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-06T16:45:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2010616950,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwMTA2MTY5NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2010616950","actor":{"login":"GedMarc","id":5367513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjc1MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5367513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc","html_url":"https://github.com/GedMarc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedMarc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6c63fd80e5f3287d8d7d8a3836c7b2688c58b38d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GedMarc/oss-parent/commits/6c63fd80e5f3287d8d7d8a3836c7b2688c58b38d","created_a

#969]\r\n\r\nThe issue here was a bit different than initially thought: The code works just fine for Jackson libraries up to version 2.9.7\r\nFrom version 2.9.8 on the handling of \"Void\" type deserialization has been changed. This is due to https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2197\r\nBy that the Jackson deserializer will return \"null\" instead of illegally instantiating the \"Void\" class via reflection. This in turn breaks the Reactor mapping as it doesn't allow null.\r\nThis PR will keep the backward compatibility with Jackson 2.9.7 and below, but will also make the code compatible to Jackson 2.9.8 and above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/issues/990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/issues/990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2647422906,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MjY0NzQyMjkwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/2647422906","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-19T15:22:49Z","label":{"name":"ACTIVE","color":"f9de7a"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
