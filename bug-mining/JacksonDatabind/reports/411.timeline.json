part of bigger set of changes, see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-future-ideas/wiki/JSTEP-4)\r\n\r\nAlthough choice of `JsonProcessingException` to extend `IOException` made sense originally (I think), later developments -- in particular, Java 8 Streams and functional approach in general -- have made use of checked exceptions cumbersome for many use cases.\r\nBut due to backwards compatibility concerns, change of base exception type has not been possible within 2.x releases.\r\n\r\nNow that we are working on 3.0, however, we can make this change. Compared to alternative of providing alternate subtypes of `ObjectMapper`, `ObjectReader` and/or `ObjectWriter` (ones that do not declare checked exceptions for methods), this leads to simpler API.\r\nFor 2.x we may still consider simpler work-arounds (maybe convenience wrappers), but with 3.0 let's rebase.\r\n\r\nNote, too, that this will help use of Jackson for some specific cases like serialization of `this` from `toString()` (and with #2176).\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2177/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2177/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T22:46:11Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T22:46:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/18","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/18/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/18/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/18/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/18","id":4738853,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzM4ODUz","number":18,"title":"Make
