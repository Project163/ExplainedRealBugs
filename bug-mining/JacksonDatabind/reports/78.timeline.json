I was able to figure out a place in code where additional synchronization can prevent the failure.\nWhat bothers me is that I do not yet fully understand, end to end, exactly what the problem is, and why synchronization (basic on per-ObjectMapper object; in this case, SerializerCache) prevents it.\nI think that instead of incorrect caching it is due to exposing partially resolved instance too early (meaning that the incorrect output would be sort of transient), but I can not fully verify this.\n\nNonetheless due to severity of the problem, and since fix does work for the test case given (with longer run times; compared to regularly failing without sync block), and since there should not be much actually harm (code should not be called often once caching takes effect), I think I will add the fix/work-around, get 2.5.2 released, and just keep this in mind for
