But if there really is strong desire to support \"raw values\" through Tree node representation, a new node type can be added. I am hesitant, however, since I do not want to be promoting use of unquoted values: I think that is wrong usage and should be eliminated, not facilitated.\n\nAdding new `JsonNode` types is quite possible, of course, as well as defining custom (de)serializers for `JsonNode`. So it is technically possible to add custom handlers that would add support for raw values, regardless of whether standard databind does that or not.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/68781205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/68847813","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/348#issuecomment-68847813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/348","id":68847813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODQ3ODEz","user":{"login":"pulse00","id":185278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/185278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00","html_url":"https://github.com/pulse00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pulse00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-06T10:11:55Z","updated_at":"2015-01-06T10:11:55Z","body":"Are there any examples on how one would add a custom `JsonNode` type which can then be used by a custom `JsonSerializer`?

Fetch additional serializer(s) in `createContextual()` (and implement `ContextualSerializer`), by a lookup from `SerializerProvider` given at that point (and, if you want, info via `BeanProperty` concerning actual property serializer is used with)\n2. Use dynamic per-call lookup directly from serialize method(s)\n\nOf these, 1 is more efficient, but 2 is simpler to use.\n\nThen again many custom serializers just override handling of dependant pieces without delegation; this may work if you know your exact settings and do not need to delegate to types provided by external datatype modules (like Joda or Guava)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/68898345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/86977000","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/348#issuecomment-86977000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/348","id":86977000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTc3MDAw","user":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-27T15:34:41Z","updated_at":"2015-03-27T15:34:41Z","body":"Hi,\n\nAs I'd like to use wicket-jquery-selectors with Jackson 2.5, I'm as well trying to ouput raw values using Jackson 2.5 and I haven't made it work so far.\n\nJackson is used by a lot of Java libraries to generate Json used as a configuration for Javascript libraries.
