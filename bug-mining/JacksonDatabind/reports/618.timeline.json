So POJO implementing `CharSequence` should typically NOT be serialized as `CharSequence` but as POJO. But determining this is not... trivial.\r\nConceptually I suspect that the heuristic would be to see that if the only detected property is `empty`, we'd consider fallback; and I think something like this was done for maybe `Iterator` handling. I wish remembered the issue.\r\nWe cannot really ignore `isEmpty()` in general as it is legit accessor; although in worst case we might want to prevent its detection at introspection for `CharSequence`.

value, say `AppId.valueOf(\"3074457345618296002\")`\r\nIn JDK 8 it is serialized by default (as expected):\r\n```\r\n\"3074457345618296002\"\r\n```\r\nIn JDK 17 it is serialized wrong:\r\n```\r\n{\"empty\":false}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThere is a default serialization for classes defined as subclasses of `java.lang.CharSequence`. This logic is defined in `BasicSerializerFactory.findSerializerByAddonType(SerializationConfig, JavaType, BeanDescription, boolean)`:\r\n```\r\nif (CharSequence.class.isAssignableFrom(rawType)) {\r\n    return ToStringSerializer.instance;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt is working pretty well and reliable till JDK 15. This JDK version introduces new method in `java.lang.CharSequence`:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n     *\r\n     * @since 15\r\n     */\r\n    default boolean isEmpty() {\r\n        return this.length() == 0;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAs the result this branch in `BeanSerializerFactory`:\r\n```\r\nAnnotatedMember anyGetter = beanDesc.findAnyGetter();\r\nif (anyGetter != null) {\r\n```\r\nbecomes visited in JDK 17 (there is a property \"empty\") and default `ToStringSerializer` is not applied anymore (object is serialized as bean).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5662630905,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAC5e2c49nTMvzwAAAAFRhOP5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/5662630905","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-23T19:50:30Z","rename":{"from":"ObjectMapper
