have a `TypeIdResolver` implementation which works around generic type erasure to allow marshaling/unmarshaling of a parameterized type.  This works fine when the underlying parameterized type maps directly onto a JSON type e.g. `java.lang.Double` but when it's a type that needs to be converted to a JSON string e.g. `java.time.LocalDate` then my `TypeIdResolver` is asked for a type and I can either return the String \"java.time.LocalDate\" or a null value.\r\n\r\nIf I return a null then `TypeSerializerBase#handleMissingId` currently does nothing as per https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/633 but it looks like the control of how to write the typeId is now handed off to `JsonGenerator#writeTypePrefix` @ https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonGenerator.java#L1061\r\n\r\nIt would be great if writeTypePrefix

regression partly due to #3373, reported f.ex as #4354 (but not just that))\r\n\r\nSo: if custom `TypeIdResolver` returns `null` from `idFromValue()` or `idFromValueAndType()`, result is that underlying `JsonGenerator.writeTypePrefix()` call is omitted. This may work for some cases, but won't for others, because necessary parts of structure are missing.\r\n\r\nConceptually the idea would be that `null` for Type Id means \"do not add Type Id\", but doing so cannot be done by simply skipping calls to `JsonGenerator`s `writeTypePrefix()` and `writeTypeSuffix()`: rather, calls need to be made but these methods need to be aware of possibly missing type id and output whatever else is necessary.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: another way to describe this is that if `idFromValue()` / `idFromValueAndType()` returns `null`, serialization occurs AS IF non-polymorphic serialization was used. For `As.PROPERTY` / `As.EXISTING_PROPERTY`, for example, output would be similar but without `\"type\": \"typeId\"` entry in JSON Object; and for wrappers (`As.ARRAY_WRAPPER` / `As.OBJECT_WRAPPER`) no wrapping is added.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4407/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14794525988,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5e2c5B3_tPzwAAAANx0o0k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/events/14794525988","actor":{"login":"ggrebert","id":1737774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mzc3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1737774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert","html_url":"https://github.com/ggrebert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggrebert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ef6564c5cf03144ad9689b1444d3654c6f18eb15","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ggrebert/jackson-databind/commits/ef6564c5cf03144ad9689b1444d3654c6f18eb15","created_at":"2024-10-22T23:36:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
