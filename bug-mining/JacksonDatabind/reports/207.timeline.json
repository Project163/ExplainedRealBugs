so, fix here is two-fold. First, declared type MUST indicate it's a reference type (`Optional`), so declaration has to be something like:\n\n```\npublic class JsonResult {\n  @JsonSerialize(as=Optional.class) // important!\n  private Object a;\n  private Optional<Object> b;\n}\n```\n\nThe other part of the fix is to make sure Jackson actually uses type modified by annotation; this was not done but fix will be in 2.8.1. This combination will make tests pass.\n\nOne thing I do not understand, however, is why `NON_EMPTY` would not work here; it should work without additional type information. But I could not reproduce that issue; test actually works for me if `NON_EMPTY` is used.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/232261477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
