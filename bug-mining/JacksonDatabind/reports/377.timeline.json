I've noticed a behavior I think should be different with\r\n@jsonsetter(value = \"foo\", nulls = Nulls.SKIP)\r\nprivate String foo;\r\nand with

want you to set null.\r\n\r\nbut what is probably happening is that it sees a value which is not null so it tries to set it, then when it can't set it, it becomes null.\r\n\r\nI realize that it will be probably hard to fix, but on the other hand, the whole point of the nulls attribute is to do something else with nulls...\r\n\r\ntest case:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public enum NUMS{\r\n        ONE,
