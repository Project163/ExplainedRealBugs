the problem here is because `Exception`s (or in general `Throwable`s) do not use standard POJO serializers/deserializers. The reason is that there are couple of problems in making things work with fully default handling. As a result, support for many annotations is missing or incomplete.\nThis is not intentional, but rather based on having to implement support explicitly, and some aspects are missing; it should be possible to add support for ignorals for example.\n\nThank you for reporting the problem; I hope we will be able to fix this in a future
