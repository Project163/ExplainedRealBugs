We use generics on MyHashMap to enforce that every value implements a certain interface that respects the contract of returning an \"id\" property.  In this example Foo.java implements this interface MyCustomIdInterface.java.\n\nWhen using 2.6.6 this worked fine, but if I switch to 2.7.x then it breaks with the error:\n\n`Can not construct instance of MyCustomIdInterface, problem: abstract types either need to be mapped to concrete types, have custom deserializer, or be instantiated with additional type information`\n\nin 2.7.x, it looks like jackson resolves to using AbstractDeserializer based on MyCustomIdInterface but in 2.6.6 it resolves to using BeanDeserializer based on Foo.java.\n\nIs this a bug or is there some default/feature flag that changed here?\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
