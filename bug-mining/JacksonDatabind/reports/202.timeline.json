Yes I think that a minimal (or just as small as practical) test case would be great. I don't doubt existence of the problem, or that propose fix could work either completely or partially. But it would allow checking optimal placement of handling. I also thought that bean properties for sure were properly handled wrt forward-references (can't find original check-in, but #610 is fixing one aspect), so this could even be a regression of some kind; and if so, perhaps would allow seeing what changed.\n\nAt any rate a test case would be great whenever you get a chance.

a follow-up to bug #1255, the patch I provided exposes related deserialization problems.\nI have attached a small project ('jackson-test.zip') to demonstrate these issues. When run with both patches from #1255, the output is provided in the attached 'both.txt'. When run with just the first patch from #1255, the output is provided in the attached 'first.txt'.\nImportant points:\n1. When the object expressed as an id is contained within a collection or map (List in this example), deserialization works correctly. When it is a field of an object, deserialization is broken.\n2. This particular example doesn't have forward references, but it does have cycles. Nevertheless, I have seen situations where non-cyclical forward-references also do not deserialize properly, with the same caveat as in 1.\n[jackson-test.zip](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/301884/jackson-test.zip)\n[both.txt](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/301885/both.txt)\n[first.txt](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/files/301886/first.txt)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/224179532","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1255#issuecomment-224179532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1255","id":224179532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDE3OTUzMg==","user":{"login":"arifogel","id":7737874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mzc4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7737874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel","html_url":"https://github.com/arifogel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T05:16:31Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T05:16:31Z","body":"Let's continue this conversation in bug #1261.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/comments/224179532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"arifogel","id":7737874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mzc4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7737874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel","html_url":"https://github.com/arifogel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arifogel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
