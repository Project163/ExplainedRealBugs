After updating to jackson 2.9 I noticed that this method doesn't work anymore and visibility is reset to default (ANY for getters/is getters and public for other)\r\n\r\nI've created a repository that shows this issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/saladinkzn/jackson-auto-detect-issue\r\n\r\nIf run without changes it produces following output:\r\n```\r\n{\"shouldBeDetected\":0,\"shouldNotBeDetected\":null}\r\n[Visibility: getter=PUBLIC_ONLY,isGetter=PUBLIC_ONLY,setter=ANY,creator=ANY,field=PUBLIC_ONLY]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if I comment out any disable line (e.g. AUTO_DETECT_IS_GETTER) I receive following output:\r\n```\r\n{\"shouldBeDetected\":0}\r\n[Visibility: getter=NONE,isGetter=PUBLIC_ONLY,setter=NONE,creator=NONE,field=NONE]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess the reason is that getDefaultVisibilityChecker explicitly skips disabling if none of AUTO_DETECT features is enabled. \r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/jackson-databind-2.9.4/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/cfg/MapperConfigBase.java#L675\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI see that this code is rewritten in master branch already, so I'll try to reproduce my issue on it.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1947/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
