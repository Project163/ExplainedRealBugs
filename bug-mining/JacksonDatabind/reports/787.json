And since `getArtifactId()` returns `\"\"` instead of `null`, this results in `getTypeId()` returning the same `\"\"` for distinct modules.  \n\nI think either `_hasExplicitName` name should not be set to true when it is not explicitly passed in, or `_name` should be set to null if `getArtifactId()` returns empty string.    The former is probably easier since there validation in ObjectMapper to ensure `getModuleName()` is not null, although it doesn't really seem correct to implicitly set name to an empty string - especially when it can also result in `getTypeId()` being an empty string. \n\nHere is a simple test case:\n\n```\n  public class Module1 extends SimpleModule {\n        public Module1() {\n            super(Version.unknownVersion());\n        }\n    };\n    \n    public class Module2 extends SimpleModule {\n        public Module2() {\n            super(Version.unknownVersion());\n        }\n    };\n    \n    @Test\n    public void test() {\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n        mapper.registerModule(new Module1());\n        mapper.registerModule(new Module2());\n        Set<Object> modules = mapper.getRegisteredModuleIds();\n        Assert.assertEquals(2, modules.size());\n    }\n```\n\n\n### Version Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Reproduction\n\n<-- Any of the following\n1.
