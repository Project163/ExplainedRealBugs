The second time I press `Alt-Enter`, it opens but the cursor of the new file is on 1 line and the line of my current file is scrambled.\r\n\r\nAlso, whoever is going to fix this, I would like to see these key bindings somewhere in the documentation, as the only mention of it is the code in PR.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. `hx helix-term/src/commands` + `g400g`.\r\n2. `gr` + select second entry + `<Alt-Enter>`.\r\n\r\nYou will see that your cursor on the current file is on line 166.
