Adding a register here would be more ergonomic. I was just fixing some unit tests in another project and had to rename the same name in multiple function in multiple files. Since there was no shared scope the LSP was not too helpful. Being able to pull up recent renames would make this refactoring work easier. Either the existing ':' used for other history or perhaps another register dedicated to this? I am using semicolon in code locally. Happy to post a tiny PR if we can agree on the register to use.","closed_by":{"login":"pascalkuthe","id":61850714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODUwNzE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61850714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe","html_url":"https://github.com/pascalkuthe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalkuthe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/10560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/10560/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
