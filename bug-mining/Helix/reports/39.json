Unfortunately the file is named \"todo.txt\" which matches to an autoformatter which targets \"todo.txt\".\r\n\r\nThis is a local file that I happen to use for note taking + todo list. I did not lost the data but the text is now \"sorted\" in such way that I lost the significance of notes.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is bad user experience and we should not have this autoformater targeting \"todo.txt\".\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nEdit a file with any content which is named `todo.txt`\r\n\r\n```\r\nhx todo.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave\r\n\r\n```\r\n:w\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe text should be sorted, which means that if you have text it'll be all over the place.\n\n### Helix log\n\n<details><summary>~/.cache/helix/helix.log</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nplease provide a copy of `~/.cache/helix/helix.log` here if possible, you may need to redact some of the lines\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Platform\n\nmacOS\n\n### Terminal Emulator\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation Method\n\nbrew\n\n### Helix Version\n\nhelix 24.3 (2cadec0b)","closed_by":{"login":"archseer","id":1372918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer","html_url":"https://github.com/archseer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/10113/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/10113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
