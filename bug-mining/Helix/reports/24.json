It's probably my favorite feature from VSCode that I miss in Helix. In particular, the VSCode autocomplete provides the following types of suggestions that I'm missing:\r\n- will show suggestions where the currently typed stub is in the middle\r\n  - so if I've typed `back`, the autocomplete will suggest options like `my_data_backup`\r\n- will show suggestions where letters in the currently typed stub show up spaced out throughout the suggestion in order\r\n  - so if I've typed `bgvn`, the autocomplete will suggest options like `_big_global_variable_name`\r\n- autocomplete can be configured via settings to be case-insensitive","closed_by":{"login":"archseer","id":1372918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer","html_url":"https://github.com/archseer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/3084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/3084/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
