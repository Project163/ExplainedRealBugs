the bug**\r\n\r\nOpening a file that does not exist crashes ErlangLS.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, one can `touch` the file before attempting to open it.\r\n\r\nBased on the crash report it looks like this originated from the new shallow indexing functions introduced in https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls/pull/1260.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nOpen a file that does not exist yet in your editor. This happens for me within an existing workspace like a rebar3 project but also outside of workspaces on any file. This may be difficult to reproduce in any editor that immediately writes a file when it opens it. I expect it occurs with something like `vim f.erl` where `f.erl` doesn't exist yet. In my case: `hx f.erl`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nMainly I would like to avoid the crash. Diagnostics for the buffer would be gravy.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nErlangLS crashes and terminates leaving an `erl_crash.dump`.\r\n\r\nLogs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2022-05-14T17:47:14.484015-05:00] [error] Generic server els_provider terminating.
