It would be a neat enhancement to be able to configure these, but potentially in a more global fashion. That way if any new features added movement capabilities, inversion would automatically be applied.","closed_by":{"login":"the-mikedavis","id":21230295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjMwMjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21230295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis","html_url":"https://github.com/the-mikedavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/3835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/3835/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
