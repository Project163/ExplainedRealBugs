The current `Application::handle_signals` calls `Terminal::autoresize` indirectly instead of `Compositer::resize`. But `autoresize` does nothing if the actual size is equal to the stored one. So redrawing is skipped.\r\nI think we need to call `Terminal::resize` after all or to call `Terminal::clear` directly.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n<!-- Ideally provide a key sequence and/or asciinema.org recording. --> \r\n\r\nI tried this:\r\n\r\n1. `hx`\r\n1.
