falls into the same `unimplemented!` as #2051 but not for the same reason. The `w` key event from the view transition sequence (`<C-w>w`) applies to the newly focused view. So the mode-change hook sees the normal mode of the originally focused view as Normal and the newly focused view as Insert and tries to lookup the key sequence bound to the current event: `w`. It sees the sequence of commands bound to `w` and tries to save them as if they were used to enter insert mode, which is unimplemented (covered by #2051).\r\n\r\nIt's possible to reproduce this from another angle by changing the `rotate_view` command to another key like `<C-w>m` since `m` yields a `KeymapResult::Pending` which also falls into the `unimplemented!()` block.\r\n\r\nInstead, the `w` should be consumed earlier and mode-change and history checkpoint hooks shouldn't be triggered - similar for the behavior when the last view is closed and the application is about to exit.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/comments/1223297330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"the-mikedavis","id":21230295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjMwMjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21230295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis","html_url":"https://github.com/the-mikedavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7236979865,"node_id":"LE_lADOD__WI85N6gBVzwAAAAGvW4yZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/events/7236979865","actor":{"login":"the-mikedavis","id":21230295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjMwMjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21230295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis","html_url":"https://github.com/the-mikedavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-22T23:12:22Z","label":{"name":"A-helix-term","color":"FBCA04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/comments/1223452829","html_url":"https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/3090#issuecomment-1223452829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/3090","id":1223452829,"node_id":"IC_kwDOD__WI85I7Gid","user":{"login":"archseer","id":1372918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer","html_url":"https://github.com/archseer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-23T02:35:17Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T02:35:17Z","body":"Hmm, a potential fix is to always look up the same document: the one that was current at the start of handle_event.
