I use \"A-s\". When goto_mode is active and there is too much jump labels on the screen (that's my observation, i am not sure), if i click \"A-s\" second time, it will be interpretied as \"s\" symbol for jumping, instead of closing goto_word mode. Also if remove \"s\" from jump-label-alphabet in editor settings, clicking \"A-s\" will close \"goto_word\" mode as expected.\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nI tried this:\n\nbind \"A-s\" = [ \"normal_mode\" \"goto_word\" ];\nopen some file with many words\n\nI expected this to happen:\nfirst click A-s: goto_word mode active;\nsecond click A-s: exit from goto_word mode\n\nInstead, this happened:\nfirst click A-s: goto_word mode active;\nsecond click A-s: behavior as if clicked \"s\" without Alt\n\n### Helix log\n\n\n\n\n### Platform\n\nlinux\n\n### Terminal Emulator\n\nfoot version: 1.20.1 +pgo +ime +graphemes +toplevel-icon -assertions\n\n### Installation Method\n\nflake\n\n### Helix Version\n\nhelix 25.01.1 (b00b475d)","closed_by":{"login":"the-mikedavis","id":21230295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjMwMjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21230295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis","html_url":"https://github.com/the-mikedavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/12695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/12695/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
