idea is to make view mode more pager-like, and to make (half-)page-wise scrolling easier.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I suggest `space` to scroll down, like most pagers. Unfortunately, `shift-space` cannot be used to scroll up due to terminal limitations, so I suggest `backspace` as an alternative. I also suggest `J` and `K` for downwards and upwards scrolling, respectively.
