I'll start with the editor design side of things.\r\n\r\nIn editors like VSCode, transactions are oriented around spaces, but this doesn't follow the conventions of modal editors like (Neo)Vim and Kakoune, which only make transactions after exiting insert mode (e.g., enter insert mode, type stuff, exit insert mode, undo, everything done in insert mode is undone).\r\n\r\nHere's the relevant code at `helix-term/src/ui/editor.rs#1432`:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\n...\r\nEvent::Key(mut key) => {\r\n  ...\r\n  // Store a history state if not in insert mode. This also takes care of\r\n  // committing changes when leaving insert mode.\r\n  if mode != Mode::Insert {\r\n      doc.append_changes_to_history(view);\r\n  }\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's a couple solutions, most likely of which (in my opinion) is that this won't be supported. Another option is to start committing transactions every space like VSCode does, but this will change how a very common functionality in modal editors works, so I'm not personally keen on that. A middle ground could be that we create a temporary `Vec` of `Transaction`/`Revision`s when entering insert mode that works like normal editors, and that gets cleared when exiting `insert` mode.\r\n\r\nNow, onto the actual bug, the panic.\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at helix-core/src/transaction.rs:293:9:\r\nassertion failed: original_doc.len_chars() == self.len\r\n...\r\n12:     0x56051c5dcaa7 - helix_core::transaction::ChangeSet::invert::ha8b1f55c37e72755\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bug is that (with a non-empty `History`), if you go into `insert` mode, make some changes, and try to undo them whilst in insert mode, the underlying `ChangeSet` hasn't been updated with the document's length, and so it panics from an assert that was added into `invert` (as well as other methods like this):\r\n\r\n```rs\r\n/// Returns a new changeset that reverts this one. Useful for `undo` implementation.\r\n/// The document parameter expects the original document before this change was applied.\r\npub fn invert(&self, original_doc: &Rope) -> Self {\r\n    assert!(original_doc.len_chars() == self.len); // panics here\r\n```\r\n\r\n```rs\r\n#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]\r\npub struct ChangeSet {\r\n    pub(crate) changes: Vec<Operation>,\r\n    /// The required document length. Will refuse to apply changes unless it matches.\r\n    len: usize,\r\n    len_after: usize,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm still learning the codebase, so I'm not positive what the best way to address this is. I think it partly depends on what the preferred approach to \"Undo in `insert` mode\" is, whether that is that it's not supported, a temporary `insert`-specific `Vec`, or simply making more Transactions (though even that won't work without addressing the `original_doc.len == ChangeSet.len` constraint).\r\n\r\nAnother note, this also happens with `:later`, and there's probably some other ways to trigger this bug with other commands in `insert` mode that eventually trigger `compose` or `invert`.\r\n\r\nTLDR is that the `invert` function is being a little *too* safe here, and doesn't expect `earlier/later/undo/redo/etc.` to be called without `Revision`s and the doc being in sync.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/comments/2209498291/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kanielrkirby","id":77940607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTQwNjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77940607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby","html_url":"https://github.com/kanielrkirby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanielrkirby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/comments/2209545615","html_url":"https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/11077#issuecomment-2209545615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/11077","id":2209545615,"node_id":"IC_kwDOD__WI86Dsv2P","user":{"login":"the-mikedavis","id":21230295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjMwMjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21230295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis","html_url":"https://github.com/the-mikedavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-04T20:42:54Z","updated_at":"2024-07-04T20:42:54Z","body":"See
