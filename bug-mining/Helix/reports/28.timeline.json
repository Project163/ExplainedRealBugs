I don't think your commit really solves this issue. The problem is that some people indent the body of namespaces while others don't (mainly since often the majority of a source file is just the body of some namespace). In my experience, the 2nd style is more common (and nvim-treesitter uses it as well), but we should try to support both. The current indentation system cannot really handle this. It's especially bad in this case, since it causes the indentation in basically the entire file to be off by 1 if one uses a style different from the indent query.\r\n\r\nTo really address the issue, the indentation system needs to be more resilient with respect to global differences in indentation. One possibility would be to always compute the tree-sitter indentation for the newly inserted line as well as for the line above. The difference can then be added to the actual indentation of the line above to get the indentation of the new line. This would make the indentation queries \"self-correct\" in some sence, since any incorrect style that affects both lines will just cancel out.\r\n\r\nImplementing something like that would also make it a lot easier to write new indent queries, since they will be usable even if they're not yet complete. Right now, having no treesitter indent queries is usually a lot better than having a bad/incomplete one.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/comments/1464975380/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Triton171","id":16193831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTkzODMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16193831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171","html_url":"https://github.com/Triton171","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Triton171/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8724479386,"node_id":"MEE_lADOD__WI85gayy9zwAAAAIIBP2a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/events/8724479386","actor":{"login":"archseer","id":1372918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer","html_url":"https://github.com/archseer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-11T18:28:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8724479388,"node_id":"SE_lADOD__WI85gayy9zwAAAAIIBP2c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/events/8724479388","actor":{"login":"archseer","id":1372918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer","html_url":"https://github.com/archseer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-11T18:28:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8725982162,"node_id":"REE_lADOD__WI85gayy9zwAAAAIIG-vS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/events/8725982162","actor":{"login":"the-mikedavis","id":21230295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjMwMjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21230295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis","html_url":"https://github.com/the-mikedavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-mikedavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-12T17:10:49Z","state_reason":"reopened","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8806554099,"node_id":"REFE_lADOD__WI8

to compute the indentation of a new line, we run an indent query both for the insertion position and for a non-empty line above. Then, we add the difference of these computed indents to the actual indentation of the line above. This makes indent queries a lot more resilient: Any error / inconsistency which applies to both lines will be canceled out, e.g.:\r\n- Incorrect / Incomplete indent queries. In particular, incomplete indent queries are no longer worse than no indent queries with this change. This should also make it easier to contribute new languages since one can start by adding a few simple captures and then gradually add more.\r\n- Incorrect parsing of the syntax tree by tree-sitter (e.g. if the code is incomplete)\r\n- Different formatting styles where only one can correctly be handled by indent queries. This is especially interesting for languages like Markdown and LaTex where indent queries weren't really feasible until now due to the variation in formatting.\r\n\r\nThe main thing still missing from this PR is some way to disable relative indent queries. While this shouldn't really be necessary when using Helix, relative indent computation makes debugging indent queries more difficult. Should this be an option? Or is there a better way to do it?\r\nI also haven't tested my changes a lot, so I appreciate it if anyone wants to try it out. I'll also use it myself for some time before marking the PR ready for merging.\r\n\r\nThe only significant downside of this change is that we now compute 2 (or in rare cases 3) indent queries when inserting a new line. The time needed for this only becomes noticable when inserting a new line with many cursors at once. If this is an issue, we could disable smart indent when inserting many (e.g. > 1000) newlines at once. For now, I think it is fine though (I haven't seen any complaints about the current indent queries being slow with many cursors either).\r\n\r\nFixes #6235\r\nFixes #7206\r\nFixes (partially) #6939
