Now, obviously `<space>` has a different usage in normal mode, but in view mode (and in particular 'sticky' view mode) it could be used for scrolling. That would give you the best of both worlds, it seems.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"archseer","id":1372918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer","html_url":"https://github.com/archseer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archseer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/2721/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/2721/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
