`yazi --debug` output\n\n```Shell\nN/A\n```\n\n### Please describe the problem you're trying to solve\n\nI think Calendar Versioning (CalVer)](https://calver.org/) would make a lot of sense for a project like Yazi. With Yazi making breaking changes most releases, Semantic Versioning (SemVer) doesn't really make much sense. For example, see Helix, where they release every ~4 months using CalVer: https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/releases - so the versions look like 24.07 and 25.01.\n\n### Would you be willing to contribute this feature?\n\n- [ ] Yes, I'll give it a shot\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nRelease the next version using Calendar Versioning.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt could look like (assuming it was released today): 2025.01.27 (YYYY.MM.DD), 2025.01 (YYYY.MM), 25.01 (YY.MM, what Helix uses as mentioned above), 25.01.27 (YY.MM.DD), etc. If a format without the day as the third number (e.g. YY.MM) is used, another digit can be added for subsequent versions in the same month. So versioning might go like 25.01 (one release in January), 25.01.1 (another January release), 25.02 (now a release in February), 25.02.1 (another February release), 25.02.3 (yet another February release), 26.4 (a release in April of the next year), etc...\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues/discussions\n- [x] The [latest nightly build](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/installation/#binaries) doesn't already have this feature","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sxyazi/yazi/issues/2251/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sxyazi/yazi/issues/2251/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16875536707,"node_id":"REFE_lADOD__WI86lEZoczwAAAAPt3EFD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/events/16875536707","actor":{"login":"Smithx10","id":12032554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDMyNTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12032554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10","html_url":"https://github.com/Smithx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smithx10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"68e59f4f7ee711174f12d1500e43aa6104081a5a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Smithx10/helix/commits/68e59f4f7ee711174f12d1500e43aa6104081a5a","created_at":"2025-03-19T18:36:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17399904283,"node_id":"REFE_lADOD__WI86lEZoczwAAAAQNHXgb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/events/17399904283","actor":{"login":"paholg","id":4908217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDgyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4908217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg","html_url":"https://github.com/paholg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paholg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"05ea676f510c7b4549ae35682872a16aed417164","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paholg/helix/commits/05ea676f510c7b4549ae35682872a16aed417164","created_at":"2025-04-25T03:39:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18076375518,"node_id":"REFE_lADOD__WI86lEZoczwAAAAQ1b5ne","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/issues/events/18076375518","actor":{"login":"Trivernis","id":19694973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Njk0OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19694973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis","html_url":"https://github.com/Trivernis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trivernis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3fc1db7660f4a029cd2f691b4886c100874ed9a8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Trivernis/helix-plus/commits/3fc1db7660f4a029cd2f691b4886c100874ed9a8","created_at":"2025-06-10T14:06:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
