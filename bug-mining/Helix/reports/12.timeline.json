very easy to use new rust features without realizing it since\r\nthe CI and local development workflows may use the latest rust version.\r\nWe try to keep some backwards compatibility with rust versions to make\r\npackaging easier for some OS-level package-managers like Void Linux's.\r\nSee #1881.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new CI check which uses the cargo-msrv crate to\r\nverify an MSRV version recorded in helix-term's Cargo.toml. When\r\nchanging MSRV, we can then edit `helix-term/Cargo.toml`'s\r\n`package.metadata.msrv` key.\r\n\r\nThe MSRV is set at 1.60.0 for the sake of checkmarks on builds but\r\nideally we want to support 1.57.0.
