issue seems to be similar to the one fixed here https://github.com/FasterXML/aalto-xml/pull/75/commits, though the cause is a bit different:\r\n\r\nI get 'javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException: Incomplete surrogate pair in content: first char 0xdfce, second 0x78' exception when I try to write CData with multi-byte char sitting right at the border of 512-sized internal buffer.\r\n\r\nExample test to reproduce (copied from https://github.com/FasterXML/aalto-xml/blob/master/src/test/java/com/fasterxml/aalto/sax/TestSaxWriter.java#L10 and slightly adjusted for writeCData()):\r\n```\r\nStringBuilder testText = new StringBuilder();\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < 511; i++)\r\n            testText.append('x');\r\n        testText.append(\"\\uD835\\uDFCE\");\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++)\r\n            testText.append('x');\r\n        WriterConfig writerConfig = new WriterConfig();\r\n        ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n        Utf8XmlWriter writer = new Utf8XmlWriter(writerConfig, byteArrayOutputStream);\r\n        writer.writeStartTagStart(writer.constructName(\"testelement\"));\r\n

think the reason is that ByteXmlWriter#writeCDataContents() lacks this piece of code which exists in writeCharacters():\r\n```\r\nif (_surrogate != 0) {\r\n            outputSurrogates(_surrogate, cbuf[offset]);\r\n//           reset the temporary surrogate storage\r\n            _surrogate = 0;\r\n            ++offset;\r\n            --len;\r\n
