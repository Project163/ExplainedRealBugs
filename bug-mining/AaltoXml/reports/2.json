You can\nsee this in the constructor \n\n   public AsyncJenaParser(ContentHandler handler, AsyncXMLStreamReader streamReader) throws XMLStreamException {\n        this.handler = handler;\n        this.lhandler = (handler instanceof LexicalHandler) ?\n                (LexicalHandler) handler :\n                NO_LEXICAL_HANDLER ;\n        handler.setDocumentLocator(new LocatorConv(streamReader));\n        final XMLInputFactory xf = InputFactoryImpl.newInstance();\n        this.streamReader = streamReader;\n        this.eventReader = xf.createXMLEventReader(streamReader);\n    }\n\nSo this is not SAX parsing. It is just using an event reader instead of the stream reader. The class is used currently by the following Scala code which extends the com.ning.http.AsyncHandler \n\n  https://gist.github.com/1713663\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/aalto-xml/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/aalto-xml/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
