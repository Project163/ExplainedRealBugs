The first part of the 4K text was 325 characters before a newline character was encountered. I think the fault is that at this point in the code (_config..willEscapeCR()) the _outputPtr is not set to ptr! So in my case ptr was 692 but gets reset to 407. This left me with garbled output.\n\nI tried a patched aalto-xml jar with a modified ByteXmlWriter.writeCharacters():\n\n```\nif (_config.willEscapeCR()) {\n    _outputPtr = ptr;\n    break;\n}\n```\n\nthis appeared to fix my issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/aalto-xml/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/aalto-xml/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
