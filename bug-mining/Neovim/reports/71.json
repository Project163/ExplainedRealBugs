So there are two (maybe more) problems with the `vim._ftplugin.lua` code, specifically:\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blame/1e7406fa38eef8cb9812272196a97cf530218c4e/runtime/lua/vim/_ftplugin/lua.lua#L10C11-L10C11\n\n1. Hardcoding 'lua/' directory as search location for modules doesn't work for Wezterm (which looks in `plugins/` relative to config file, not `lua/plugins/` like this code assumes), and\n2. Hardcoding like this is not honouring any local `set path+=` I have done to add specific places to look when doing `gf` and friends.\n\n@brianhuster \n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\ncd /tmp\nmkdir plugins\ntouch plugins/gohere.lua\nnvim --clean\n```\n\nin neovim:\n\n```\n:set path+=plugins/\n:e test.lua\n```\n\ninput text:\n```\nrequire('plugins.gohere')\n```\n\ntry `gf` on it, you should get `E447: Can't find file \"plugins.gohere\" in path`. Check `:set path?` and\nyou should have `path=.,,,plugins/`\n\nThis works in Vim, but not in Neovim because of `:e $VIMRUNTIME/lua/vim/_ftplugin/lua.lua`\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`gf` to honour any `path` set by the user, and to not assume user is using lua in neovim codebase.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nnightly\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, latest Vim does not have this special lua file\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian buster\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nsource build","closed_by":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
