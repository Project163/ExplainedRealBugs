Problem\n\nIn the current release of Neovim v0.10 it looks like the version is incorrectly given by `vim.version()`. Could this be that a `dev` build was made accidentally rather than a production release, or if there is a bug in `vim.version()`. But it currently outputs as if it is a `dev` version.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim --clean\r\n:lua =vim.version()\r\n:lua =vim.version():__tostring()\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt should return a version table that isn't set with `prerelease = \"dev\"` and the output of the version string shouldn't be `0.10.0-dev...`\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0 (github release)\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nn/a\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.33.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nofficial GitHub release, https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/v0.10.0/nvim-linux64.tar.gz ","closed_by":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28782/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28782/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
