sure.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/1838521967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"echasnovski","id":24854248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU0MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24854248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski","html_url":"https://github.com/echasnovski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/1838525048","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/26372#issuecomment-1838525048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/26372","id":1838525048,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPphoM5tlap4","user":{"login":"lewis6991","id":7904185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQxODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7904185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991","html_url":"https://github.com/lewis6991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-04T12:21:56Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T12:22:04Z","body":"Honestly,

like to add one more facet to this discussion that I didn’t see mentioned yet: For several terminals, having an application use a background color for its whole UI (instead of leaving most of it at the “default” color) breaks terminal _transparency_.\r\n\r\nSo, as you might know, some terminals allow some degree of transparency, i.e. have whatever window is behind the terminal, or the desktop wallpaper, shine through the terminal window. It’s obviously eyecandy, but quite a few people use it. But: On some (or maybe even most?) of the terminals supporting this, only the “default background color” (i.e. `\\e[49m`) gets the special transparency treatment.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is Neovim running in tmux in WezTerm on Windows. You can see the desktop background image through the terminal, but NeoVim’s status bar, the separate items in the tmux status bar, and even the `'colorcolumn'` are not transparent at all.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/28629/584ad714-28fb-486c-91d8-0b3e3973b04f)\r\n\r\nI’d argue that this is a good thing, because it’s what makes the visual difference between “parts of the terminal are opaque, parts are see-through” vs. “I’ve just uniformly dialed down the opacity of the whole terminal, yolo”.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I understand both sides here: The one saying “I already _have_ a terminal background color, Vim shouldn’t bring its own”, but also the one saying “we can’t design a good colorscheme without defining the background color on which it is displayed”.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/1839136437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"scy","id":28629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy","html_url":"https://github.com/scy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11168430016,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPphoM54jvWEzwAAAAKZsLfA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/11168430016","actor":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7aea7dd7c21e1d3226d0237abb4048a32e297bc8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bfredl/neovim/commits/7aea7dd7c21e1d3226d0237abb4048a32e297bc8","created_at":"2023-12-06T13:32:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11168462286,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPphoM54jvWEzwAAAAKZsTXO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/11168462286","actor":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d2fbf05717c6b6538b8da5bc7d70401d20c423a8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bfredl/neovim/commits/d2fbf05717c6b6538b8da5bc7d70401d20c423a8","created_at":"2023-12-06T13:34:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11171686087,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPphoM54jvWEzwAAAAKZ4mbH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/11171686087","actor":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8f10362cdc5835a1cd86c8195ce8e3b10ab85384","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bfredl/neovim/commits/8f10362cdc5835a1cd86c8
