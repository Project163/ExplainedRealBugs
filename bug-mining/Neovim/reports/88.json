Problem\n\nThis is a recent issue I have that is hard to describe minimally. There's a conflict, sort of, between vim-fugitive and mini.notify. If I open my `packages.lua` file (which is basically my lazy.nvim plugin spec), then do `:Gdiffsplit`, I observe the following:\n\n1. The diffsplit is opened as expected\n2. mini.notify is showing lsp updates in a floating window\n    <img width=\"1725\" height=\"570\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e74c930-4329-43a2-a1ee-392c766539db\" />\n4. when the notifications stop and the floating window is removed, fugitive exits diffmode\n    <img width=\"1727\" height=\"479\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ced233-0e0e-41e2-b1b0-63000c599e3b\" />\n\n\nI've traced the problem and have the following observations:\n\n* The problem happens in Neovim nightly.\n* The problem does not happen in Neovim v0.11.3.\n* The autocommand here is what is triggering the diffmode exit: https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/blob/61b51c09b7c9ce04e821f6cf76ea4f6f903e3cf4/autoload/fugitive.vim#L6548-L6551\n  * For some reason, `s:can_diffoff(+expand('<abuf>'))` returns true.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI'm sorry to say that it is hard to create a minimal reproducible setup for this. I can look into it later if it is strictly necessary.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe expected behaviour is that exiting a floating window from the notifications does not also exit diffmode.\n\n<img width=\"1725\" height=\"437\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b8a77f-dcc1-49c0-8763-8590f99d127e\" />\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-1067+g0b8a9bde0e\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNot relevant\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm 20250730-195751-6a493f88\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nAUR","closed_by":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/35453/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/35453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
