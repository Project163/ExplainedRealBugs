Version 0.11 breaks that, and nothing in the update notes mentions swapfiles.\n\nGiven my `tmux`-powered, scatterbrained workflow, I find the warning quite helpful, as I often don't realize that I already have the file open in a different pane.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nwith `vim.cmd('autocmd! nvim_swapfile')` in `init.lua`, launch a Neovim process.\n\n```\nError detected while processing /home/eliminmax/.config/nvim/init.lua:                                                                                                                                               \nE5113: Error while calling lua chunk: vim/_editor.lua:0: /home/eliminmax/.config/nvim/init.lua..nvim_exec2() called at /home/eliminmax/.config/nvim/init.lua:0, line 1: Vim(autocmd):E216: No such group or event: nvim_swapfile                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nstack traceback:                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n        [C]: in function 'nvim_exec2'                                                                                                                                                                                \n        vim/_editor.lua: in function 'cmd'                                                                                                                                                                           \n        /home/eliminmax/.config/nvim/init.lua:10: in main chunk                                                                                                                                                      \nPress ENTER or type command to continue\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`nvim_swapfile` works, or release notes document its removal (and ideally replacement)\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0; Build type: Release; LuaJIT 2.1.1741730670\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian 12\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.26.5, xterm 379-a\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty, xterm\n\n### Installation\n\nRelease tarball","closed_by":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33075/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33075/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
