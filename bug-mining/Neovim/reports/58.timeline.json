`showmode` in `terminal_enter` may cause `vpeekc` to process events, which may handle pending escape sequences. If `CSI ? 25 l` is handled to hide the cursor, it may remain hidden even after leaving terminal mode if both `terminal_enter` and (indirectly) `showmode` call `ui_busy_start`, as there is only one matching call to `ui_busy_stop` after leaving terminal mode.\r\n\r\nSolution: let `terminal_enter` handle setting the initial visibility of the cursor before calling `showmode`.\r\n\r\nCloses #32456.\r\n\r\nThis simple solution assumes it isn't possible for e.g. `os_breakcheck` to be called indirectly by something else before `terminal_enter` initially handles cursor visibility and after
