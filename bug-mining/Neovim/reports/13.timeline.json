Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nv0.10.0-dev-d2e7cc6\r\n\r\n(Just tested v0.9.4 and it works, so it's specifically an issue with nightly)\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nNixOS 23.11\r\n\r\n### Output of :AerialInfo\r\n\r\n```\r\nAerial Info\r\n-----------\r\nFiletype: python\r\nConfigured backends:\r\n  treesitter (supported) (attached)\r\n  lsp (supported)\r\n  markdown (not supported) [Filetype is not markdown]\r\nShow symbols: Class, Constructor, Enum, Function, Interface, Module, Method, Struct\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\n`AerialOpen left` and `AerialOpen right` always work, but `AerialOpen float` is always empty:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim/assets/597206/c80edeb0-f1bf-4cf3-ad1f-b8600b7f5d84)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim/assets/597206/904629aa-6f84-45a5-b999-bc78e676915b)\r\n\r\nThe first time I run `AerialOpen float` in a Neovim session, it shows \"Loading\", but nothing ever happens:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim/assets/597206/030d242f-34c3-4383-ab45-7a639773c738)\r\n\r\nIf I reopen it, it's an empty window like above.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open any document supported by Aerial\r\n1. Run `:AerialOpen float`\r\n1. See empty floating window, no visible error messages\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nShould have the same content as `:AerialOpen left/right`\r\n\r\n### Minimal example file\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Foo:\r\n    def foo():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    def bar():\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Minimal init.lua\r\n\r\n```Lua\r\n-- DO NOT change the paths and don't remove the colorscheme\r\nlocal root = vim.fn.fnamemodify(\"./.repro\", \":p\")\r\n\r\n-- set stdpaths to use .repro\r\nfor _, name in ipairs({ \"config\", \"data\", \"state\", \"cache\" }) do\r\n

my Aerial config, didn't make a difference.\r\n\r\n`:AerialNavOpen` works, so the only thing that doesn't work is `:AerialOpen float`, which is my preferred use case
