you sure about the bisecting here? That commit had a much more reproducible bug https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27859, with the same symptoms you are seeing. In Neovide we saw responses to the wrong messages. This was fixed by https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28717. So, I think you need to include that fix in your biscting.\n\nIt's also possible that the fix was incomplete, or that there are two bugs, one which is much more rare. In Neovide we haven't observed that, probably because we were also able to get rid of the problematic `ext_hlstate` extension, so we don't deal with huge messages anymore.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/2608963425/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fredizzimo","id":9946255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDYyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9946255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo","html_url":"https://github.com/fredizzimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredizzimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/2615519058","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/31316#issuecomment-2615519058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/31316","id":2615519058,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPphoM6b5adS","user":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-27T11:35:52Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T11:36:40Z","body":"@Lyude Test the latest master.
