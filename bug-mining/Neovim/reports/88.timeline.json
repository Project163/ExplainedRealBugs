When I apply your patch, the issue seems to be resolved.\n\n> (I think what's happening is `BufWinLeave` is firing for the float's buffer, but `bufwinnr()` is giving the window number of the diff window instead)\n\nYes, that makes sense to me as well. I've tested by `echo`ing in the fugitive code, i.e.:\n\n```vim\nfunction! s:can_diffoff(buf) abort\n  echo \"DEBUG\"\n        \\ a:buf\n        \\ bufwinnr(a:buf)\n        \\ bufname(bufwinnr(a:buf))\n  return getwinvar(bufwinnr(a:buf), '&diff') &&\n        \\ !empty(getwinvar(bufwinnr(a:buf), 'fugitive_diff_restore'))\nendfunction\n```\n\nWithout the patch, it outputs this:\n\n```\nDEBUG 4 2 fugitive://home/lervag/.config/nvim/.git//0/lua/lervag/init/packages.lua\n```\n\nWith the patch, it outputs this:\n\n```\nDEBUG 4
