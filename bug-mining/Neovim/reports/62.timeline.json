I remember adding this at some point when parsers would sometimes not be available on the runtime path unless `nvim-treesitter` was sourced first. I think this stems from `0.9.0` behavior. Shouldn't be an issue with any newer versions.\n\nThe other purpose of the dependency is just to make sure highlights are enabled which is done through the highlights module.

able to reproduce this with a combination of 2 things:\n\n1. Running parse inside a `vim.schedule`\n2. A fairly large & complex file, it seems like large on its own is not enough, I imagine it's something to do with how long it takes for neovim to finish parsing, but just a guess\n\nI'm able to get this error fairly consistently with this `minimal.lua`:\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('FileType', {\n    pattern = 'markdown',\n    callback = function(event)\n        local buf = event.buf\n        vim.treesitter.start(buf, 'markdown')\n        vim.schedule(function()\n            assert(vim.treesitter.get_parser(buf)):parse({ 0, 80 })\n        end)\n    end,\n})\n```\n\nAnd using the README from my repo: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim/refs/heads/main/README.md\n\nI'd paste it here but it's long, seems like 800 lines is the tipping point, but it's pretty inconsistent and sometimes smaller files will run into the error.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/2774470950/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MeanderingProgrammer","id":52591095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTkxMDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52591095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer","html_url":"https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeanderingProgrammer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/2774752552","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/33277#issuecomment-2774752552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33277","id":2774752552,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPphoM6lY10o","user":{"login":"clason","id":2361214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjEyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2361214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason","html_url":"https://github.com/clason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-03T07:37:53Z","updated_at":"2025-04-03T07:37:53Z","body":">
