Create the following 'init.lua':\n\n    ```lua\n    local buf_id = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true)\n    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf_id, 0, -1, false, { 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa', 'bbb', 'ccc' })\n\n    local config = { relative = 'editor', row = 1, col = 1, height = 5, width = 10, border = 'single' }\n    vim.api.nvim_open_win(buf_id, true, config)\n    ```\n2. `nvim --clean -u init.lua`\n3. `:=vim.fn.screenattr(4, 2)` shows -1. Executing `:=vim.fn.screenstring(4, 2)` shows the correct │ border character. Executing both `:=vim.fn.screenattr(3, 2)` and `:=vim.fn.screenattr(5, 2)` (border characters that are not adjacent to wrapped line continuation) shows 30.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`screenattr()` value does not depend on whether target cell is for border cell adjacent to wrapped line continuation.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-208+gbd413a2f55\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, doesn't have this feature\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nEndeavourOS Linux x86_64,  6.14.4-arch1-1\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGhostty 1.1.3-arch1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-ghostty\n\n### Installation\n\nAppimage and built from source","closed_by":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33719/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
