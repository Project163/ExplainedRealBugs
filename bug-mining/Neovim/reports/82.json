This is in contrast to dict-like iterators, which return `nil` in the same circumstances.\n\nIf this is expected behaviour, feel free to close this, but it doesn't seem right to me.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun the following lua script:\n```lua\nlocal dict_iter = vim.iter({ hello = 1, there = 2 })\nlocal list_iter = vim.iter({ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 })\n\n-- Filter out _all_ elements of iterator, returns nil\nprint(dict_iter:filter(function(k, v)\n\treturn false\nend):last())\n\n-- Filters out _all_ elements of iterator, but returns 2\nprint(list_iter:filter(function(v)\n\treturn false\nend):last())\n\n-- Printing the ArrayIter yields an empty table, as expected\nprint(vim.inspect(list_iter:totable()))\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe snippet below should return `nil` as all elements have been filtered out of the iterator\n```lua\nprint(list_iter:filter(function(v)\n\treturn false\nend):last())\n```\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.2-release\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nEndeavorOS 6.11.8-arch1-2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.37.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nAppImage installed from github release","closed_by":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/34696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/34696/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
