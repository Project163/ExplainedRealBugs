After calling this function, the buffer is scrolled to top, not preserving the current cursor position. When I switch to the buffer with changed lines, the cursor position is restored and the window is scrolled correctly. It works as expected in Neovim 0.9.5.\r\n\r\nNightly:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/3128467/b4b0b65a-50cd-413e-8663-53638c721679\r\n\r\n0.9.5:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/3128467/b73476c4-a3d7-4a3b-85db-636823847553\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal lines = {}\r\nfor i = 1, 100 do\r\n  lines[i] = tostring(i)\r\nend\r\n\r\nvim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(OTHER_BUFFER_ID, 0, -1, false, lines)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Run Neovim nightly\r\n2. Run the provided script for your buffer (use `:luafile` for example)\r\n3. Set your cursor position somewhere in the middle of the file.\r\n4. Create a split and run the provided script for the previously configured buffer (make sure to set the correct buffer id, it can't be 0).\r\n\r\nResult: the buffer is scrolled to top.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe updated buffer should preserve it's cursor position without scrolling to top.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nv0.10.0-dev-2501+gdbf6be296\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nmacOS 14.2.1\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\niTerm2\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nscreen-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nrepo","closed_by":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/27723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/27723/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
