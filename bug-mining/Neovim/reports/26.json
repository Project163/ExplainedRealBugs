For example on this page: \r\n\r\nhttps://neovim.io/doc/user/\r\n\r\nyou see text jumbled together in a paragraph.  For instance, each section should be formatted like a table.  In the 'Basic Editing' section 'starting' should be in the first column and its corresponding description is in the second column.  In the next line you should see 'edit-files' and its corresponding description. Instead all the subsections are joined together in a paragraph.\r\n\r\nPages like https://neovim.io/doc/user/insert.html#insert.txt are also hard to read.\r\n\r\nI didn't take the time to examine the script that generates the online manuals.  However, I did see a recent commit to it in regards to word wrapping.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nView the reference manual online.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the the contents of the online user manual to be formatted/wrapped similarly to the how neovim shows the same manual.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nNot applicable\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Installation\n\nNot applicable","closed_by":{"login":"clason","id":2361214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjEyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2361214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason","html_url":"https://github.com/clason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28754/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
