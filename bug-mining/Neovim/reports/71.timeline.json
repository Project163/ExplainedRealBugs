Of course that is neither breaking change nor regression, as I explained above.\n\nYeah, upon checking again, i forgot i have my own includeexpr implementatin for lua fts, that is more lenient in that regard. Disabling the includeexpr and using a path with relative cwd with `** and ,,`, should allow OP to open stuff `/lua` and `/plugins` because according to OP his path was set to only `path+=/plugins`. By default path includes `,,` so not sure if `+=/plugins` is even needed.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/2853414325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"asmodeus812","id":15955811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1ODEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812","html_url":"https://github.com/asmodeus812","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmodeus812/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17532194602,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPphoM61OhR1zwAAAAQVAA8q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/17532194602","actor":{"login":"brianhuster","id":111893501,"node_id":"U_kgDOBqtb_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111893501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster","html_url":"https://github.com/brianhuster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d57f3e7d26fcc559aacca58598381071b7805902","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brianhuster/neovim/commits/d57f3e7d26fcc559aacca58598381071b7805902","created_at":"2025-05-06T07:48:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"brianhuster","id":111893501,"node_id":"U_kgDOBqtb_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111893501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster","html_url":"https://github.com/brianhuster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianhuster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-06T07:51:18Z","updated_at":"2025-05-06T07:51:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33867","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33867/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33867/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33867/events","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/33867","id":3041877327,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAPphoM6VDm6P","number":33867,"title":"fix(runtime):
