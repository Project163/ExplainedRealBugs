It turned out that it is started for phpactor LS so I got [the command](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/dbf6be296df6da28151afdcb96ceb8ba2076cc65/runtime/lua/vim/_watch.lua#L274-L284) into one-liner and ran it directly from console. I saw the stderr there (it was `Event queue overflow`) but not in nvim. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOn Linux try to (for example) decrease `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events` enough to get _event queue overflow_ error and see if nvim warns about it. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNotify about errors using `stderr` callback to `vim.system` or in another way.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nv0.10.0-dev-2500+gdc8c086c7\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nDebian Sid\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nalacritty\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nalacritty\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nfrom repo","closed_by":{"login":"lewis6991","id":7904185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQxODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7904185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991","html_url":"https://github.com/lewis6991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/27713/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/27713/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
