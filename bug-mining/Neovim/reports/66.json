Open any terminal (tested in Ghostty, Kitty, and the default macOS Terminal)\n2. Run: nvim --clean\n3. Enter: \":suspend\"\n4. In the suspended shell, attempt to scroll with the mouse wheel or click in the terminal window.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAfter suspending Neovim with :suspend, mouse scroll and click events should be handled by the terminal (e.g. scrolling the buffer, focusing the window).\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nvim 9.0.2142\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS Sequoia 15.0.1 then updated to macOS Sequoia 15.4.1 \n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGhostty 1.1.4-main+7daabddd\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-ghostty\n\n### Installation\n\nhomebrew","closed_by":{"login":"zeertzjq","id":35768171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY4MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35768171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq","html_url":"https://github.com/zeertzjq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33708/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
