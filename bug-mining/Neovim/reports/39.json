When recording a macro, that's not the case: if I record a macro and paste some text (for example to add a line of text) during the recording, then that text is not added when executing the macro.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Copy some text to the clipboard\r\n- Start a terminal that supports bracketed paste mode (I tested with gnome-terminal and wezterm)\r\n- Start Neovim (nvim --clean)\r\n- Start a macro: [q][q]\r\n- Start insert mode: [i]\r\n- Paste the text in the terminal with [Ctrl-Shift-V]\r\n- Exit insert mode and stop the macro: [Esc], [q]\r\n- Replay the macro: [@][q]\r\n\r\nResult: the text is not added again.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe macro should add the text that was copy-pasted during the recording.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.9.6-dev-18+g0ef27180e\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo (Vim 9.1)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian testing\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ngnome-terminal 3.50.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nBuild from repo (0.9 branch)","closed_by":{"login":"zeertzjq","id":35768171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY4MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35768171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq","html_url":"https://github.com/zeertzjq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
