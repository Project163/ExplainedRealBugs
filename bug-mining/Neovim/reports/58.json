(`showmode` -> `skip_showmode` -> `char_avail` -> `vpeekc` -> `loop_poll_events` -> ... -> `term_settermprop`)\n\nIf this happens, the `if (!s->term->cursor.visible)` check in `terminal_enter` will cause `ui_busy_start` to be called _again_, incrementing `busy` an extra time; this can result in `busy` being left with a non-zero value after leaving terminal mode, causing the cursor to remain invisible.  \n\nHappens after the terminal cursor changes in #31562 (0dd933265ff).  \nAppears to be the cause of ibhagwan/fzf-lua#1827.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSource the following with `--clean` (not at startup):\n\n```lua\nvim.cmd.new()\n-- Not using chansend here; want terminal_receive to happen via terminal_start -> showmode -> ... -> vpeekc\nvim.fn.jobstart([[echo -e \"\\e[?25l\"]], {term = true})\nvim.api.nvim__redraw({valid = false})\n\nvim.cmd.startinsert()\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"TermClose\", {\n  once = true,\n  callback = function(args)\n    vim.api.nvim_buf_delete(args.buf, {force = true})\n  end,\n})\n```\n\nNotice that the cursor remains hidden; `busy` remains non-zero.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nMatching number of `busy_stop` to `busy_start` events; cursor does not remain hidden.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0a0f536\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nLinux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ntmux 3.5a (in ghostty b975f1e)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nSource","closed_by":{"login":"seandewar","id":6256228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTYyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6256228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar","html_url":"https://github.com/seandewar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seandewar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/32456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/32456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
