This was a hidden bug that is now exposed since the servername is now validated. Before https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/96128a5076b7e45fc01163151401a9e2acdff565 , `NVIM_APPNAME=test_configs/test nvim` would silently fail to create a server and `v:servername` would be empty.\r\n\r\nWithout `--listen`, Nvim generates a servername based on `$XDG_STATE_HOME` (which is influenced by `NVIM_APPNAME`). It seems that `server_start` is failing for the `NVIM_APPNAME=test_configs/test` case.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/2328506491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14128197778,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAPphoM6VP8RazwAAAANKGzCS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/14128197778","actor":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-04T10:33:19Z","milestone":{"title":"0.11"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-06T10:56:00Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T10:56:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/30282","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/30282/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/30282/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/30282/events","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/30282","id":2510142451,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPphoM6Vnbvz","number":30282,"title":"build

commit implements the ability to control all of the XDG paths\nNeovim should use. This is done by setting an environment variable named\nNVIM_APPNAME. For example, setting $NVIM_APPNAME makes Neovim look for\nits configuration directory in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/$NVIM_APPNAME instead of\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim.\n\nIf NVIM_APPNAME is not set or is an empty string, \"nvim\" will be used as\ndefault.\n\nThe usecase for this feature is to enable an easy way to switch from\nconfiguration to configuration. One might argue that the various $XDG\nenvironment variables can already be used for this usecase.

Problem:\r\nIf `$NVIM_APPNAME` is a relative dir path, Nvim fails to start its primary/default server, and `v:servername` is empty. Root cause is d34c64e342dfba9248d1055e702d02620a1b31a8, but this wasn't noticed until 96128a5076b7 started reporting the error more loudly.\r\n\r\n## Solution:\r\n- `server_address_new`: replace slashes \"/\" in the appname before using  it as a servername.\r\n- `vim_mktempdir`: always prefer the system-wide top-level \"nvim.user/\" directory. That isn't intended to be specific to NVIM_APPNAME; rather, each *subdirectory* (\"nvim.user/xxx\") is owned by each Nvim instance. Nvim \"apps\" can be identified by the server socket(s) stored in those per-Nvim subdirs.\r\n\r\nfix #30256\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/22128#discussion_r1749271437\r\n\r\n> > usecase I had in mind was applications that do something very different from each other (e.g. mail clients embedding nvim, chat clients embedding nvim and so on). From that point of view, it made little sense to desire a way to connect to all neovims running on the same machine\r\n> \r\n> I think we can still support that use-case even if all the nvim tempdirs are under one `/tmp/nvim.user/` root. The nvim servernames stored in each `/tmp/nvim.user/xxx/<appname>.n.m` use the appname.
