I'm encountering an error with Ultimate-autopair.nvim specifically in files with the .norg filetype (The plugin works as expected in other file types). When I enter insert mode and try to press Enter to move to a new line, the following error message appears: \r\n\r\n`Error 10:28:32 PM msg_show.lua_error E315: ml_get: Invalid lnum: 27`\r\n\r\nif i try to enter again, a message appears \r\n\r\n`10:28:36 PM msg_show.echo ...autopair.nvim/lua/ultimate-autopair/extension/escape.lua:23: attempt to index field 'line' (a nil value)\r\nstack traceback:\r\n    ...y/ultimate-autopair.nvim/lua/ultimate-autopair/debug.lua:77: in function '__index'\r\n    ...autopair.nvim/lua/ultimate-autopair/extension/escape.lua:23: in function 'filter'\r\n    ...autopair.nvim/lua/ultimate-autopair/extension/escape.lua:36: in function <...autopair.nvim/lua/ultimate-autopair/extension/escape.lua:35>\r\n    [C]: in function 'xpcall'\r\n    ...y/ultimate-autopair.nvim/lua/ultimate-autopair/debug.lua:97: in function 'run'\r\n    ...zy/ultimate-autopair.nvim/lua/ultimate-autopair/core.lua:96: in function <...zy/ultimate-autopair.nvim/lua/ultimate-autopair/core.lua:87>\r\n    [C]: in function 'nvim_eval'\r\n    ....local/share/nvim/lazy/nvim-cmp/lua/cmp/utils/keymap.lua:181: in function 'solve'\r\n    ....local/share/nvim/lazy/nvim-cmp/lua/cmp/utils/keymap.lua:154: in function <....local/share/nvim/lazy/nvim-cmp/lua/cmp/utils/keymap.lua:153>\r\n`\r\n\r\nThis error occurs only when I press Enter in insert mode to move to a new line in .norg files. Interestingly, pressing Alt+Enter (a default Neorg keybinding) works fine, and I don’t encounter any issues with it. \r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Open a .norg file.\r\n2. Enter insert mode.\r\n3. Press Enter to create a new line.\r\n4. Observe the error message above.\r\n\r\n**Troubleshooting Attempts:**\r\n\r\n- I tried disabling autopair for the .norg filetype using the following configuration:\r\n\r\n``` lua \r\n{\r\n  \"altermo/ultimate-autopair.nvim\",\r\n  event = {\r\n    \"InsertEnter\",\r\n    \"CmdlineEnter\"\r\n  },\r\n  opts = {\r\n    extensions = {\r\n      filetype = {\r\n        nft = {\r\n          \"TelescopePrompt\",\r\n          \"Norg\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nDespite this, the issue persists when Ultimate-autopair.nvim is enabled.\r\n\r\n- When I disable Ultimate-autopair.nvim, everything works fine.\r\n- I also have mini.pairs installed through lazyvim which was disabled in favor of ultimate-autopair.nvim. If I enable mini.pairs instead, I don’t encounter the error.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n    Neovim version: NVIM v0.10.2\r\n    Ultimate-autopair.nvim version: v0.6 branch\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\nWhen I searched for the E315 error, I found that it is an internal Vim error related to invalid line numbers, which might indicate an internal issue. Given that the error appears specific to pressing Enter in .norg files, and doesn’t occur when mini.pairs is active or when Ultimate-autopair.nvim is disabled, I’m unsure if this is an issue with Ultimate-autopair.nvim itself or a conflict in my configuration.\r\n\r\nAny guidance or suggestions on resolving this would be greatly appreciated!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/altermo/ultimate-autopair.nvim/issues/102/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/altermo/ultimate-autopair.nvim/issues/102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"echasnovski","id":24854248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU0MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24854248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski","html_url":"https://github.com/echasnovski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echasnovski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-06T09:58:51Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T09:58:51Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/32349","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/32349/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/32349/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/32349/events","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32349","id":2835064298,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPphoM6o-6Xq","number":32349,"title":"`ml_get`

Problem\n\nExecuting `:redrawstatus` inside `on_detach` can lead to `E315: ml_get: Invalid lnum: 1` error in some cases. This, for example, affects doing 'redrawstatus' inside `DiagnosticChanged` callback, as it can be triggered inside [`on_detach` from LSP](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/878b3b89c316138d99f9dbc47c84f2f94591df03/runtime/lua/vim/lsp.lua#L911).\n\n#28084 is possibly related (cc @seandewar), but it shows error while unloading is performed inside `on_detach`. The currently described issue results in an error with `on_detach` only accessing data and not doing any action.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create the following 'init.lua':\n    ```lua\n    -- Make `on_detach` redraw statusline\n    _G.attach_redrawstatus = function()\n      local buf_id = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()\n      vim.api.nvim_buf_attach(buf_id, false, {\n        on_detach = function()\n          -- Using `vim.api.nvim__redraw({ buf = buf_id, statusline = true })`\n          -- does not show the error in this particular repro, but in real world\n          -- use case still shows several `E315: ml_get: Invalid lnum: 1` errors.\n          --\n          -- Using `vim.schedule(vim.cmd.redrawstatus)` fixes the issue completely.\n          vim.cmd.redrawstatus()\n        end,\n      })\n    end\n\n    -- Set up tabline that accesses buffer-local option of scratch buffer\n    local scratch_buf_id = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true)\n\n    _G.make_tabline_string = function()\n      -- NOTE: actual option name doesn't seem to matter, i.e. can be 'buftype' or\n      -- something else\n      local _ = vim.bo[scratch_buf_id].buflisted\n      return 'Hello'\n    end\n\n    vim.o.tabline = '%!v:lua.make_tabline_string()'\n    vim.o.showtabline = 2\n    ```\n2. `nvim --clean -u init.lua`\n3. `:lua attach_redrawstatus()`\n4. `:bwipeout`. Should show the `E315: ml_get: Invalid lnum: 1` error.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nExecuting `:redrawstatus` inside `on_detach` does not lead to errors.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-1698+gaa976f0d93\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, doesn't have this functionality\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nEndeavourOS Linux x86_64, 6.12.10-arch1-1\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGhostty 1.1.0-arch\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-ghostty\n\n###

Problem\n\nInternal error `E38: Null argument` (and maybe other weirdness) is possible under specific conditions if `nvim_buf_attach`'s `on_detach` callback redraws a window to an unloaded buffer while hlsearch is active.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```lua\nvim.cmd \"new | silent! /.\"\nvim.bo.bufhidden = \"delete\"\nvim.api.nvim_buf_attach(0, false, {\n  on_detach = function()\n    -- Buffer's ml is gone (buf_freeall called), but it's still in a window.\n    -- Maybe \"on_detach\" should have been called before that point...\n    assert(vim.fn.bufloaded(vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()) == 0)\n\n    -- This changes the topline from 1 to 0, which dubiously causes win_update\n    -- to attempt to draw a win_line when we redraw.\n    vim.fn.winrestview(vim.empty_dict())\n    vim.cmd \"redraw!\"\n  end,\n})\nvim.cmd \"quit!\"\n```\n\nThe `winrestview` call is needed to screw up the topline so this condition is false:\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/bee45fc0e7801396951cd156c82953cbadc256b9/src/nvim/drawscreen.c#L2067\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo error.\n\nIt's a bit dubious that `on_detach` is called inside an unloaded buffer, especially when it's still in a window. (At least it's textlocked 😌)\n\nThat said, `nvim_buf_call` can be used to do the same (except the unloaded buffer is shown in the autocmd window); a bit sus, but I couldn't replicate the same issue via that route as `buf_clear_file` sets the `ml_line_count` to 1 before `close_buffer` returns.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.12.0-dev-347+gbee45fc0e7\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the
