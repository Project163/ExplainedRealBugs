This document is a complete and\ncentralized reference of the differences.\n```\nHowever,  it doesn't report all Vim features that Nvim doesn't support or Nvim is incompatible with, which leads to confusion like https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/17301#issuecomment-2423192494\n\nThere are also other _big_ Vim features that Nvim doesn't support (not sure if Nvim doesn't want them or they are just missing), like `popup`, `textprop`\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSee `:h vim_diff.txt`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSince Vim is still actively developed, I think it's hard to have a complete and up-to-date list of all differences between Nvim and Vim. Maybe Nvim should only compare itself against a specific Vim version, like 8.1 (since `v:version` is currently 801?) and _explicitly_ say that in the beginning of `vim_diff`?\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-7c43f8e433\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNA\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nNA\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nNA\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nNA\n\n### Installation\n\nNA","closed_by":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
