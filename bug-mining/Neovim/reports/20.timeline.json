Problem\r\n\r\nWriting test code requires some \"tribal knowledge\" that requires the test author to understand which \"helper\" functions are dispatched to the `nvim` _test session_ (the \"[SUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test)\") and which functions are handled in the context of the _test runner_.\r\n\r\nContributors must constantly be aware of the difference. Reading and writing tests can be confusing because of this, especially to non-experienced contributors.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nMake the distinction clear by either extracting SUT functions to `test/sut.lua` or grouping them in a ~~sut~~ `nvim` container.\r\n\r\n- [x] Rename `helpers.lua` to `testutil.lua` and change the import convention to (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28145):\r\n   ```\r\n   local t = require('testutil')\r\n   ...\r\n   t.foo()\r\n   t.bar()\r\n   ```\r\n    - Thus there is no need anymore to do this:\r\n      ```\r\n      local helpers = require('testutil')\r\n      local foo = helpers.foo\r\n      local bar = helpers.bar\r\n      ```\r\n    - Test code can simply use `t.xx()` everywhere to call non-SUT test util functions.\r\n- [x] #28472\n   ```lua\r\n   nvim.api.nvim_get_commands()  -- instead of helpers.api.nvim_get_commands\r\n   nvim.fn.foo()  -- instead of helpers.fn.foo()\r\n   ```\r\n    - See \"Implementation\" below.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nAlmost everything in `test/functional/testutil.lua` involves a \"session\". So in practice this would mean:\r\n\r\n1. Lift any \"pure\" functionality (functions that don't require the nvim \"test session\") from `test/functional/testutil.lua` into `test/testutil.lua`.\r\n    - `test/functional/testutil.lua` calls the `nvim` \"test session\" via RPC.\r\n1. `test/testutil.lua` is no longer \"merged\" into `test/functional/testutil.lua`.\r\n    - I.e. delete this line: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/fd085d90820149caecf213b299f19e46305043ee/test/functional/testutil.lua#L19\r\n1. Rename `test/functional/testutil.lua` to (e.g.) `…/nvimsession.lua`\r\n1. All test imports now look like:\r\n   ```lua\r\n   -- Test runner functions/utils.\r\n   local t = require('test.testutil')()\r\n   -- Nvim RPC session.\r\n   local nvim = require('test.functional.nvimsession')()\r\n   ```\r\n    - What should the test session be named?\r\n        - ~~nvim? session? sut?~~ We decided on `n`.\r\n\r\n# Future\r\n\r\nSome questions to consider for the future (out of scope for this issue):\r\n\r\n- Should `nvim` be a mirror of the nvim \"test session\" Lua stdlib? I.e. all `nvim.xx()` calls just dispatch to the Nvim \"test session\" `vim.xx()` ?\r\n- Currently, we have a global \"session\": https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/f190f758ac58d9cc955368e047b070e0a2261033/test/functional/testutil.lua#L107-L113\r\n    - This makes it less obvious what's going on in the tests.\r\n    - It is weird that \"screen\" is used as an object in test code while \"session\" is not. Especially since the \"screen\" object is strictly tied to a session anyway. You cannot have multiple screens per session.\r\n    - Solution: we could treat the Nvim session same as \"screen\", so tests would look like:\r\n      ```\r\n      local nvim = require('…/nvimsession.lua')\r\n      local n = nvim.clear()\r\n      n:command(':new foo')\r\n      t.eq(2, n:eval('1+1'))\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n# Related\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/26994\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27024","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/27004/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/27004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11836272122,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPphoM53hTpXzwAAAALBfy36","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/11836272122","actor":{"login":"clason","id":2361214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjEyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2361214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason","html_url":"https://github.com/clason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clason/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bf830a53f5b015e055383ef5c2a3ae923d9c393f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/commits/bf830a53f5b015e055383ef5c2a3ae923d9c393f","created_at":"2024-02-17T12:12:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12303067366,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPphoM53hTpXzwAAAALdUejm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/12303067366","actor":{"login":"glepnir","id":41671631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjcxNjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41671631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir","html_url":"https://github.com/glepnir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glepnir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f3957de0e6ae071b894ed8c6ac3b6d339f5d7abb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glepnir/neovim/commits/f3957de0e6ae071b894ed8c6ac3b6d339f5d7abb","created_at":"2024-03-31T11:23:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/2053690494","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/26145#issuecomment-2053690494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/26145","id":2053690494,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPphoM56aNR-","user":{"login":"jgouly","id":46615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly","html_url":"https://github.com/jgouly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgouly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-13T16:12:21Z","updated_at":"2024-04-13T16:13:16Z","body":"This is a LuaJIT parsing issue https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/issues/951, below is a very hacky work around.
