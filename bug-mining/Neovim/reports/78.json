Problem\n\nAn ml_get error may happen when updating the quickfix list when an RPC client has called `nvim_buf_attach`.\nThis is a regression from #31105.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun the following test case:\n```diff\ndiff --git a/test/functional/api/buffer_updates_spec.lua b/test/functional/api/buffer_updates_spec.lua\nindex 489f601d31..36bbbc8495 100644\n--- a/test/functional/api/buffer_updates_spec.lua\n+++ b/test/functional/api/buffer_updates_spec.lua\n@@ -911,4 +911,12 @@ describe('API: buffer events:', function()\n     sendkeys(s)\n     assert_match_somewhere(expected_lines, buffer_lines)\n   end)\n+\n+  it('when updating quickfix list', function()\n+    command('copen')\n+    local b = api.nvim_get_current_buf()\n+    ok(api.nvim_buf_attach(b, true, {}))\n+    command(\"cexpr ['Xa', 'Xb']\")\n+    command(\"caddexpr ['Xc']\")\n+  end)\n end)\n```\nIt fails with `Vim(caddexpr):E315: ml_get: Invalid lnum: 4`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo ml_get error\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.12.0-dev-656+g462f7aaa8e\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A (codepath requires nvim_buf_attach callbacks to be active)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.42.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from
