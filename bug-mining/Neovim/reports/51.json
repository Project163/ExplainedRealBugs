So I think it `:h nvim-from-vim` should specify that Nvim doesn't support Vim9script, and suggest users who write vimrc in Vim9script to switch to legacy Vimscript or Lua\n\nI know it has been mentioned in `:h vim_diff`, but I think that file is kinda long, so very likely users will miss it. Also it doesn't have a seperate tag for `vim9script`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nJust add a few lines to `:h nvim-from-vim` saying something like\n\n```vimdoc\n\nFor example, vim9script is not supported, instead Nvim support legacy |Vimscript| and |Lua| as first-class scripting languages. \nIf you want to share a |Vimrc| between Nvim and Vim, you should convert it to legacy Vimscript. \nOr if you want to keep Vim9script for Vim9, you can move legacy Vimscript code to a block like this >vim\n    if !has('vim9script')\n       \" legacy script commands go here\n       finish\n    endif\n    vim9script\n    # Vim9 script commands go here\n<\n\nOr you can maintain seperated Nvim and Vim config, which is more recommended.\n```","closed_by":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/31327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/31327/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
