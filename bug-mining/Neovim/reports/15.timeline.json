Problem\r\n\r\nWhen using Neovim nightly there is a bug with `nvim_buf_set_lines` when the buffer is not the active one. After calling this function, the buffer is scrolled to top, not preserving the current cursor position.

I am glad to see that this issue has been caught on your radar.\r\n\r\nI understand that preserving the cursor position while rewriting the buffer content can be challenging. However, I believe it is important to maintain the previous behavior where the cursor position relative to the buffer and window remains the same.\r\n\r\nA common scenario is when reformatting a file, where the entire buffer is replaced with for example stylua's output.\r\n\r\nIt is quite frustrating to have the cursor constantly moving with each format, making the editing experience very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nI have also encountered this issue with UI plugins, such as [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim/blob/main/lua/nui/tree/README.md), where the cursor jumps when the tree is redrawn inside the buffer, even when the content has not changed.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/1976702022/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pysan3","id":41065736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41065736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3","html_url":"https://github.com/pysan3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11999931663,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPphoM6BEpUQzwAAAALLQG0P","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/11999931663","actor":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-04T14:26:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11999931678,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPphoM6BEpUQzwAAAALLQG0e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/11999931678","actor":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-04T14:26:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12000018263,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAPphoM6BEpUQzwAAAALLQb9X","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/12000018263","actor":{"login":"pysan3","id":41065736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41065736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3","html_url":"https://github.com/pysan3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-04T14:32:55Z","rename":{"from":"BUG:

position.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/1976739233/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pysan3","id":41065736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41065736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3","html_url":"https://github.com/pysan3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysan3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12000161734,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPphoM6BEpUQzwAAAALLQ-_G","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/12000161734","actor":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-04T14:42:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12000161758,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPphoM6BEpUQzwAAAALLQ-_e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/events/12000161758","actor":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-04T14:42:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/comments/1976759033","html_url":"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27720#issuecomment-1976759033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/27720","id":1976759033,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPphoM510vL5","user":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-04T14:51:28Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T14:51:28Z","body":">
