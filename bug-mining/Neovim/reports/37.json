Since, I'm using Neovim nightly images, I can't be certain 100% of whether this specific commit is responsible or something else. It's just that looking through the commits in between the 2 nightly images, this specific commit made more sense regarding the error that I got. \r\n\r\n`:h $NVIM_APPNAME` mentions the following\r\n> `$NVIM_APPNAME` must be a name, such as \"foo\", or a relative path, such as \"foo/bar\".\r\n\r\nI'm used to just having a directory `~/.config/test_configs/` in which I create different directories for different distros or other users' Neovim configurations I would like to test. \r\n\r\nAfter the change in the commit mentioned above, I get an error \r\n```\r\nnvim: Failed to --listen: \"no such file or directory\"\r\n                                                     More info with \"nvim -h\"\r\n```\r\nwhen trying to do `NVIM_APPNAME=test_configs/test nvim` for example.\r\n\r\nOn another note this does not seem to happen when you just create a directory `~/.config/test/` and clone there whatever you want and then you run `NVIM_APPNAME=test nvim`. It seems to throwing the error on relative paths from what I tested.\r\n\r\nPS: Neovim stable 0.10.1 works as expected. And if I rollback to a version before this commit, then Neovim nightly also works correctly.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create directory `~/.config/test_configs/test/`.\r\n2. `git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/test_configs/test` (just an example distro, I've also tried AstroNvim with same result)\r\n3. NVIM_APPNAME=test_configs/test nvim and observe what happens\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`$NVIM_APPNAME` should behave as before the change in commit https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/96128a5076b7e45fc01163151401a9e2acdff565. \r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-705+gae9674704\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nNot tested\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nLinux Mint 21.3\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nkitty 0.36.1\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-kitty\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nI used [bob](https://github.com/MordechaiHadad/bob) to install Neovim","closed_by":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/30256/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/30256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
