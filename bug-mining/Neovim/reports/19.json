I tried to search for specific keywords that rendered me nothing relevant.\r\n\r\nI am having a issue where Neovim freezes when I use it as the editor of Git to insert a commit message.\r\nBasically, I have this in my `.gitconfig`:\r\n\r\n```gitconfig\r\n[core]\r\neditor = \"nvim --clean\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I want to commit something in a project, I just do `git commit` and it starts Neovim so I can type the message.\r\nWhen I start typing, suddenly Neovim just freezes and I have to use `kill`.\r\n\r\nI did a `git bisect` on the Neovim repository and it said that commit `89a9745a1a55dc9ffd0f8292735e45bae6c7b01e` introduced the problem.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set Neovim as editor of Git, through `.gitconfig` or `export GIT_EDITOR=\"nvim --clean\"`;\r\n2. In any git repository that has staged changed, just type `git commit`;\r\n3. Neovim will open, go to insert mode and start typing;\r\n4. You will verify that Neovim freezes (hopefully?);\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNeovim shouldn't freeze at all.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-2197+g89a9745a1\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nno, vim 9.1\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nLinux 6.7.6-zen1-2-zen\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nalacritty 0.13.2\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nalacritty\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\ngit repository","closed_by":{"login":"zeertzjq","id":35768171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY4MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35768171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq","html_url":"https://github.com/zeertzjq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28197/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
