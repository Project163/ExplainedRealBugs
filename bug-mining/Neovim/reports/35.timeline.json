per https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/29932#issue-2440957530 when using `vim.ui.open` on linux systems, calls to `xdg-open` return before the subprocess it creates (launching xyz browser, etc.) is done using the file descriptors it's given. As the underlying `vim.system` closes the file descriptors once `xdg-open` returns, this causes the launched subprocess to crash if it attempts to write to stdout or stderr.\r\n\r\nSolution: give `xdg-open` /dev/null as the file descriptor for stdout and stderr\r\n\r\nResolves #29932
