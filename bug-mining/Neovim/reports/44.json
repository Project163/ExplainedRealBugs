Moving the cursor can take a second or more for the movement to be observed.\n\nNote: version 0.9 also has this issue.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThis reproduction showcases opening a large C file with the Clangd LSP attached, creating a large code fold, and then moving the cursor around. Note that Clangd must be installed.\n\nIt should be noted that the issue still occurs on more reasonably sized files, for example `src/nvim/buffer.c` which has 4241 lines. My initial repro was to go to line [4191](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/0ba388847417b8aed469976acf94f9633cb03f15/src/nvim/buffer.c#L4191) and doing `zfgg` and moving the cursor onto and off the closing curly brace. I am using the larger single file because repro is simpler.\n\n1. `mkdir issue && cd issue`\n2. Create a file named `minimal_init.lua` with the following content:\n```lua\nlocal on_windows = vim.loop.os_uname().version:match 'Windows'\n\nlocal function join_paths(...)\n  local path_sep = on_windows and '\\\\' or '/'\n  local result = table.concat({ ... }, path_sep)\n  return result\nend\n\nvim.cmd [[set runtimepath=$VIMRUNTIME]]\n\nlocal temp_dir = vim.loop.os_getenv 'TEMP' or '/tmp'\n\nvim.cmd('set packpath=' .. join_paths(temp_dir, 'nvim', 'site'))\n\nlocal package_root = join_paths(temp_dir, 'nvim', 'site', 'pack')\nlocal lspconfig_path = join_paths(package_root, 'test', 'start', 'nvim-lspconfig')\n\nif vim.fn.isdirectory(lspconfig_path) ~= 1 then\n  vim.fn.system { 'git', 'clone', 'https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig', lspconfig_path }\nend\n\nvim.lsp.set_log_level 'trace'\nrequire('vim.lsp.log').set_format_func(vim.inspect)\nlocal nvim_lsp = require 'lspconfig'\nlocal on_attach = function(_, bufnr)\n  -- keymaps can be set here\nend\n\n-- Add the server that troubles you here\nlocal name = 'clangd'\nlocal cmd = nil\n-- local cmd = { 'pyright-langserver', '--stdio' } -- needed for elixirls, lua_ls, omnisharp\nif not name then\n  print 'You have not defined a server name, please edit minimal_init.lua'\nend\nif not nvim_lsp[name].document_config.default_config.cmd and not cmd then\n  print [[You have not defined a server default cmd for a server\n    that requires it please edit minimal_init.lua]]\nend\n\nnvim_lsp[name].setup {\n  cmd = cmd,\n  on_attach = on_attach,\n  root_dir = function()\n    return nil -- run in single file mode\n  end,\n}\n\nvim.o.rdt = 200000 -- for when running under valgrind\n\n-- print [[You can find your log at $HOME/.cache/nvim/lsp.log. Please paste in a github issue under a details tag as described in the issue template.]]\n```\n3. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chunhualiao/large-single-compilation-unit-c-programs/refs/heads/master/bzip2.c`\n4. Create a file named repro.sh with the following content:\n```sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nnvim -nu minimal_init.lua bzip2.c \"+norm 4191Gzfgg\"\n```\n5. `chmod +x repro.sh`\n6. `./repro.sh`\n7. Try moving the cursor around with h/j/k/l (in particular move over a curly bracket), and observe the slowness.\n8. Do `:LspStop` and observe that the issue completely goes away.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nScreen drawing performance should not be significantly impacted when LSP is enabled.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.10.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nVim doesn't support LSP\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nLinux 6.9.3\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty 0.13.2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation\n\nSystem package manager","closed_by":{"login":"lewis6991","id":7904185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQxODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7904185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991","html_url":"https://github.com/lewis6991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/31106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/31106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
