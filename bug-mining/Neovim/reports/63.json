This happens because mouse code calls yank_register_mline() that fetches the register to determine if it is multi-line and then do_put() fetches it again. It is not noticeable when clipboard is local, but when forwarding X or using a tunnel over the network it starts hurting quite a bit.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPaste with middle button. One would need to have a custom clipboard forwarding tool and log requests.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nContents of primary or clipboard selection only fetched once per paste operation.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-148+g1de276bbcd\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nDid not test\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nKonsole\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nDebian packages, also built from repo","closed_by":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/33493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
