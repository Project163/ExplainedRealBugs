This is fundamental IMHO for creating plugins to run on all systems.\n\nLet's assume you want to execute \"npm\" or \"node\" to run some stuff, you'll write\n\n```lua\nvim.system({\"npm\", \"-l\", \"someargs\"})\n```\n\nand everywhere it runs fine (cause alls Un*x favours incl. MacOS) executables names are identical to the callled name.\nWindows needs (like DOS) a fileextension to *mark* what filetype it is and if it should be executable.\n\nSo all executables (binary excutable / script executable) will have a different name on Windows BUT would be called the same.\n\nNo plugin developer will know if it is a .CMD / .BAT wrapper or compiled to .EXE.\n\nTo make it
