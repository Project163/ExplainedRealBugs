end_col = 8,\n  message = 'Miss symbol `,` or `;` .',\n  -- ...\n}\n```\n\n`open_float` doesn't open anything because extmark is set past the EOL (basically exactly per diagnostic position being sent). `jump` is inconsistent with that because it tries to set the cursor to `{ 2, 13 }` (1,0-indexed) position, which isn't valid (unless `set virtualedit=all` or similar), but as I understand `nvim_win_set_cursor` just clamps the column in that case and cursor ends up at `{ 2, 12 }`.\n\n`underline` is not shown past the end of the line, but I think it's possible to change that if it's changed to use extmark with `hl_eol` instead of `vim.hl.range`, which doesn't seem to support that.\n`signs` doesn't care about the column.\n`virtual_text` is shown where the diagnostic is at since it doesn't really care about the column.\n`virtual_lines` is shown where the diagnostic is at since it's a virtual line below, it could be easily shown even 5 characters past the EOL as well I

...nvimdcgMep/usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/diagnostic.lua:1587: Invalid 'line': out of range\r\nstack traceback:\r\n        [C]: in function 'nvim_buf_set_extmark'\r\n

<...nvimdcgMep/usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/diagnostic.lua:1644>\r\n```\r\nThis seems to have been introduced along with the changes made in the following PR [#33517](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/33517)\r\n\r\nHow to Reproduce:\r\n - Use a minimal lsp diagnostic config:   ` vim.diagnostic.config({virtual_lines  = {current_line = true}, virtual_text = {current_line = false}})`\r\n- Create a test file named test.lua\r\n- Ensure you have a lua lsp active \r\n- Write 3-4 lines of errors (I used the following): \r\n```\r\nasd\r\nasd\r\nasd\r\nasd\r\n```\r\n- Select and delete all lines in the file (for example using the vim motion VggD from the bottom of the file)\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThis PR introduces a check to verify that the line number does not exceed the number of lines within the buffer.
