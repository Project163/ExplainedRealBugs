Previously diagnostic handlers would not do anything at all in this scenario, which isn't great either.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. `cd <nvim-repo-path>` and add the following `init.lua` to setup an autocommand to set diagnostics from quickfix:\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('QuickFixCmdPost', {\n  callback = function(event)\n    local ns = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace 'QuickFixCmdPost'\n    vim.diagnostic.reset(ns)\n\n    local qf = vim.fn.getqflist { items = 0, title = 0 }\n\n    ---@type table<integer, vim.Diagnostic[]>\n    local per_buffer = {}\n    for _, item in ipairs(vim.diagnostic.fromqflist(qf.items)) do\n      per_buffer[item.bufnr] = per_buffer[item.bufnr] or {}\n      item.source = event.match\n      table.insert(per_buffer[item.bufnr], item)\n    end\n\n    for bufnr, diagnostics in pairs(per_buffer) do\n      vim.diagnostic.set(ns, bufnr, diagnostics)\n    end\n  end,\n})\n```\n\n2. Run `make` at least once to focus only on a single warning in later steps.\n3. Add an unused variable to `src/nvim/main.c` to cause a compiler warning, for example:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/nvim/main.c b/src/nvim/main.c\nindex 8270ddd63c..d8ada6a42e 100644\n--- a/src/nvim/main.c\n+++ b/src/nvim/main.c\n@@ -250,6 +250,7 @@ int main(int argc, char **argv)\n #endif\n {\n   argv0 = argv[0];\n+  int the_answer = 42;\n \n   if (!appname_is_valid()) {\n     fprintf(stderr, \"$NVIM_APPNAME must be a name or relative path.\\n\");\n```\n\n4. Start `nvim --clean --noplugin -u init.lua` at the repo root (from scratch, without opening a file, so that the buffer is not loaded at this point).\n5. Run `:make! | copen`. A quickfix window with a single warning should appear. At this point diagnostics are also scheduled to be set once a buffer is loaded.\n6. Run `:make!` again. Quickfix should have no warnings now since there's no need to recompile when there's no file changes. `vim.diagnostic.reset` is being called to clear diagnostics from buffers.\n7. Run `:edit src/nvim/main.c`\n8. Observe stale diagnostic sign and underline (via `/the_answer` since `[d` and `]d` do not work). Seems like it only affects `handlers` in this case. Not sure if `set` might have a similar problem in other scenarios.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo stale diagnostic sign and underlines (same for any other builtin handler).\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.12.0-dev-1282+g7837161076\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nnot applicable\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.42.2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nhttps://aur.archlinux.org/packages/neovim-git","closed_by":{"login":"justinmk","id":1359421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/35884/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/35884/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
