Problem\r\n\r\nGroup conditions do not properly work when there are multiple groups starting with the same substring and the shorter one appears earlier.\r\n\r\nFor example, `vim.glob.to_lpeg('**/*.{tsx,ts}'):match('test.tsx')` matches, but `vim.glob.to_lpeg('**/*.{ts,tsx}'):match('test.tsx')` doesn't\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `nvim --clean`\r\n2. `:lua=vim.glob.to_lpeg('**/*.{tsx,ts}'):match('test.tsx')` (returns 9)\r\n3. `:lua=vim.glob.to_lpeg('**/*.{ts,tsx}'):match('test.tsx')` (returns nil)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth of the globs match.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nv0.11.0-dev-57+gcd48b72b6\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nArch
