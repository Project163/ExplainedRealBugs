Create test folder with init.lua following the template and a markdown file with some text\r\n2. Edit `nvim -u init.lua test.md`\r\n3. Make some edits\r\n4. Save & close with `:x`\r\n5. Repeat `2` - `4` until the corruption appears\r\n6. Error message `E576: Failed to parse ShaDa file: extra bytes in msgpack string at position 4083` appears on start\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo corruption occurs.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-168+ge20c5fba2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWindos Terminal\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\n?\n\n### Installation\n\nDownload nightly from GitHub","closed_by":{"login":"bfredl","id":1363104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjMxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl","html_url":"https://github.com/bfredl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfredl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/29186/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/29186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
