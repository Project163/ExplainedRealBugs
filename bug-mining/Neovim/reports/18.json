1 do\r\n                local id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns, i, 0, {\r\n                    virt_text = {{ 'A', 'WarningMsg' }},\r\n                })\r\n\r\n                vim.print(vim.api.nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id(0, ns, id, {}))\r\n            end\r\n        end\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- start neovim using `nvim -u NONE minimal.lua`\r\n- source the `minimal.lua` file using `:source %`\r\n- on row 1 enter insert mode with `A` and press `ENTER`\r\n    - the virtual text is visible in row 1 (correct)\r\n    - there is no virtual text on the new empty row 2 (incorrect)\r\n    - virtual text is shown in row 3 (incorrect)\r\n        - this is true for the latest stable `0.9.5`\r\n        - this is false for the latest nightly `v0.10.0-dev-2739+ge2224a793`\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/6849129/7538d79e-6740-4a6b-8cee-a3bca792099f)\r\n\r\nChecking the `vim.print` outputs shows that the extmarks have the correct positions during the function execution:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n{ 0, 0 }                                                                        \r\n{ 1, 0 }  \r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever checking the extmarks afterwards  shows the wrong positions:  \r\n`:lua= vim.api.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0,vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('test'), 0, -1, {})`\r\n\r\n```text\r\n{ { 1, 0, 0 }, { 2, 2, 0 } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWrapping the whole extmark creation into a `vim.schedule(function() ... end)` call like proposed in [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14741#issuecomment-1463201526) solves the problem.\r\n\r\nAdditionally using any other method to insert a newline (e.g. using `o` or pasting) places the extmarks in the correct positions as expected.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe extmarks are all placed in the correct positions independent how the newline(s) was inserted.\r\nFurthermore for the newest nightly build I would also expect that the virtual text is shown.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.9.5\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nnot applicable\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nPop!_OS 22.04 LTS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGNOME Terminal (Version 3.44.0 for GNOME 42)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nappimage","closed_by":{"login":"zeertzjq","id":35768171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY4MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35768171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq","html_url":"https://github.com/zeertzjq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeertzjq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/28107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
