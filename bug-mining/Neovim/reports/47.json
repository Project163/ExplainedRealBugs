Was this implemented after the discussion and would this allow re-enabling the client capabilities for other `positionEncodings`?\r\n\r\nThis would especially make sense for something like rust-analyzer, because the rust spec demands rust files to be utf-8. So the client is working with `utf-8`, the server is working with `utf-8` and both have to convert all character offsets to `utf-16`.\r\n\r\nA somewhat related comment from the rust-analyzer codebase: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/f3d9c9df9010ff4dd7b51f200fc772d38c94f006/crates/rust-analyzer/src/lsp/capabilities.rs#L261\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf possible set the `positionEncodings` client capability to `{ \"utf-8\", \"utf-32\", \"utf-16\" }` or ``{ \"utf-8\", \"utf-16\", \"utf-32\" }``.","closed_by":{"login":"lewis6991","id":7904185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQxODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7904185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991","html_url":"https://github.com/lewis6991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewis6991/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/30034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovim/neovim/issues/30034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
