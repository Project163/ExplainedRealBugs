I'm facing the same problem. I'm looking for a way to make a handler for the `SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySQL server has gone away` error. And just like the original author of this issue, I tried to use `retryHandler`. But it always resets because absolutely all the queries generated by the ActiveRecord use the `setSql` or `setRawSql` methods, which calls `reset()` and consequently removes the error handler.\r\n\r\nSo I think that something should be changed here so that we can handle non-critical database errors and continue the normal operation of the

But so far this functionality was nowhere described and was of little use on real projects because almost any operation with `Command` or `Query` was done by calling `setSql()`, which called `reset()` method inside, which sets `_errorHandler` to `null`. So I don't think it's so much a change as more of a design bug fix.\r\n\r\nShould I mention this functionality in the docs? I could only find this functionality by reading the source code.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to reflect these changes in the tests, but found that the behavior with resetting the field when `reset()` was called was not covered with tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19680/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7821048476,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADRbGc4g5QRRzwAAAAHSK7qc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/7821048476","actor":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"add56d843f9e74b8cf1c40b57cdd03c91b651591","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/commits/add56d843f9e74b8cf1c40b57cdd03c91b651591","created_at":"2022-11-16T08:03:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7821049788,"node_id":"MIE_lADOADRbGc4g5QRRzwAAAAHSK7-8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/7821049788","actor":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-16T08:03:15Z","milestone":{"title":"2.0.47"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
