What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nIn a console command, when declaring an action, you can set an array as an expected value:\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic class FooController extends yii\\console\\Console\r\n{\r\npublic function actionFoo(array $bar)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut there is no way to pass an empty array:\r\n\r\nyii foo/foo '' => $bar=['']\r\nyii foo/foo null => $bar=['null']\r\nyii foo/foo [] => $bar=['[]']\r\nyii foo/foo 0 => $bar=[0]\r\n\r\nThis is because in the bindParams, it always does a preg_split:\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function bindActionParams($action, $params)\r\n    {\r\n        if ($action instanceof InlineAction) {\r\n            $method = new \\ReflectionMethod($this, $action->actionMethod);\r\n        } else {\r\n            $method = new \\ReflectionMethod($action, 'run');\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        $args = array_values($params);\r\n\r\n        $missing = [];\r\n        foreach ($method->getParameters() as $i => $param) {\r\n            if ($param->isArray() && isset($args[$i])) {\r\n                $args[$i] = preg_split('/\\s*,\\s*/', $args[$i]);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nIt makes sense that if you pass an empty string or [] it should interpret it as an empty array\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nThe argument is always an array with one element as described above\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nIt would be a rather small change in the bind params but I it could have a big impact. If the change is approved I would do the pull request\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.11.2\r\n| PHP version      | 7.1\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 16\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
