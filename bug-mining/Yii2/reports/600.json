In case you need support please use one of\r\nYii communities listed at https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/wiki/communities\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1)Create a table in sql server named [PPPPPPPP$Internet Customer Cart] with an id column.\r\n2)Create a table in SQL server named [PPPPPPPP$Order] with an id column\r\n3)Create a join table in SQL server named [PPPPPPPP$AtoB] with columns\r\ncartId\r\norderId\r\n4)Create a model named CartItem\r\n5)Create a model named Order\r\n\r\n6)Override the CartItem tablename function like so:\r\n    public static function tableName()\r\n    {\r\n\t\treturn '[PARTWERX$Internet Customer Cart]'; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n7)Try to create a getItems function in the Order table so that you can write\r\n$order->items. It is impossible because of the bug. You will see something like:\r\n\r\nSQLSTATE[42000]: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'IN'.\r\nThe SQL being executed was: SELECT * FROM [PPPPPPP$Internet Customer [Cart]] WHERE [id] IN ('....', '...')\r\n\r\nNotice the extra square brackets around the Cart.
