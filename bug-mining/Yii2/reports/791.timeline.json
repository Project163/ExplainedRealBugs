Description\r\nOne of those kinda breaking changes again. I know this is actually a feature request but I consider it as a bug because it causes errors and exceptions and breaks the current workflow in our application.\r\nIn one of your updates you enabled `enableIdn` for Yii2 E-Mail validator.\r\nNow E-Mails like \r\n\r\n```\r\näöêèé#####@äöêèéß.de\r\n```\r\nare totally fine. Unfortunately Swiftmailer throws an exception when trying to send an E-Mail to this address. \r\nWe could easily add a custom email validation via event on top of yours but that feels like a strange work-around.\r\nIt would be much better if you could opt-out via setting if you really want to allow emails with special characters.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a user with an E-Mail like \"äöêèé#####@äöêèé.de\"\r\n2. Save the user with \"send confirmation mail\"\r\n3. See the user is saved but an exception is thrown because the E-Mail is not valid for Swift, the user cannot reset their password as well.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n- Craft version: 3.6.14\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess it's due to this issue https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7103 but it worked correctly before (validator fails because it's no valid E-Mail)\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$email = 'äöêèé#####@äöêèé.de';\r\n$validator = new \\yii\\validators\\EmailValidator();\r\nif ($validator->validate($email, $error)) {\r\n    echo 'Email is valid.';\r\n} else {\r\n    echo $error;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nprints `is not a valid email address`  which is totally correct. Doing the same with a User won't trigger the validator but the Exception\r\n\r\n```\r\n[87.139.0.246][1071821][e0iksd8t8iu0lg64v3fdu7oujo][error][Swift_AddressEncoderException]\r\nSwift_AddressEncoderException: Non-ASCII characters not supported in local-part
