['value' => '1', 'text' => 'Yes']]`\r\n> \r\n> `(string)false` is `''` i.e. prompt value\r\n\r\nThat does not appear to be quite correct. In your explanation, `$key` and `$selection` are mixed up. Let me try to make it more clear:\r\nWhen I call `dropDownList([true => 'Yes', false => 'No'], ['prompt' => 'Please select'])`, it is the same as if I had called `dropDownList([1 => 'Yes', 0 => 'No'], ['prompt' => 'Please select'])`, because php immediately does the conversion of array keys.\r\n\r\nThe  cast `(string) false` therefore never occurs.\r\n\r\nHere,\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/2874e070f3ad88c727b1335ba4f4515855bf5f64/framework/helpers/BaseHtml.php#L1914\r\nthe `$key` is cast to a string, which yields `'0'` and that is fine. After this line,\r\n`$attrs = [ 'value' => 1, 'selected' => false ]`.\r\n\r\nAnd updating `'selected'` fails, because this comparison fails:\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/2874e070f3ad88c727b1335ba4f4515855bf5f64/framework/helpers/BaseHtml.php#L1917\r\nSince `$key` (being the integer 0) and `$selection` (being the boolean false) do not compare to equal with `strcmp`, which makes sense of course.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the function, the `$lines` array contains\r\n```php\r\n$lines = [\r\n'<option value=\"\">Please select<\\/option>',\r\n'<option value=\"1\">Yes<\\/option>',\r\n'<option value=\"0\">No<\\/option>']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe correct value would be\r\n```php\r\n$lines = [\r\n'<option value=\"\">Please select<\\/option>',\r\n'<option value=\"1\">Yes<\\/option>',\r\n'<option value=\"0 selected\">No<\\/option>']\r\n```\r\n\r\nand actually, I can force this in the call to `dropDownList`:\r\n```php\r\n<div>\r\n    <?php $form = ActiveForm::begin([\r\n        'action' => '/some/path',\r\n        'method' => 'GET'\r\n     ]) ?>\r\n\r\n    <?php $form->field($model, 'value')->textInput()->label(\r\n        'text')->dropDownList([true => 'Yes', false => 'No'],\r\n                ['prompt' => 'Please select',\r\n                'options' => [\r\n                        '1' => [\r\n                        'value' => '1',\r\n                        'selected' => $model->value\r\n                        ],\r\n                        '0' => [\r\n                            'value' => '0',\r\n                            'selected' => !$model->value\r\n                        ]\r\n                ]\r\n]) ?>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that is infeasible in practice, because there are many calls like this and adding this options array makes very verbose what I think should be the default behaviour. Furthermore, handling the case where `$model->value` is `null` manually would be even more complicated, as I mustn't pass `'selected'` if `$model->value` isn't set.\r\n\r\n(It is only checked whether

instead.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/1082725740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adnandautovic","id":100121069,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfe57Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100121069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic","html_url":"https://github.com/adnandautovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6332582128,"node_id":"MEE_lADOADRbGc5GX8iezwAAAAF5c4jw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/6332582128","actor":{"login":"adnandautovic","id":100121069,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfe57Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100121069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic","html_url":"https://github.com/adnandautovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-30T07:28:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6332582137,"node_id":"SE_lADOADRbGc5GX8iezwAAAAF5c4j5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/6332582137","actor":{"login":"adnandautovic","id":100121069,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfe57Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100121069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic","html_url":"https://github.com/adnandautovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-30T07:28:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6332656485,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADRbGc5GX8iezwAAAAF5dKtl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/6332656485","actor":{"login":"adnandautovic","id":100121069,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfe57Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100121069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic","html_url":"https://github.com/adnandautovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adnandautovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8565baab2b37e751c5076
