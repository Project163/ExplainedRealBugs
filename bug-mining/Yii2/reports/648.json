For example, these both would result in the same HTML being returned:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nHtml::renderTagAttributes([\r\n    'data-foo' => true,\r\n    'data-bar' => false,\r\n    'data-hello' => 'world',\r\n    'data-a' => ['b' => 'c'],\r\n]);\r\n// => data-foo data-hello=\"world\" data-a='{\"b\":\"c\"}'\r\n\r\nHtml::renderTagAttributes([\r\n    'data' => [\r\n        'foo' => true,\r\n        'bar' => false,\r\n        'hello' => 'world',\r\n        'a' => ['b' => 'c'],\r\n    ]\r\n]);\r\n// => data-foo data-hello=\"world\" data-a='{\"b\":\"c\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only value that’s *not* handled consistently between those two syntaxes is `null`. Non-`data` attributes set to `null` will be omitted completely, per this condition:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/d97a160bcea8663ecf3db051e9d92c710c8ce1d9/framework/helpers/BaseHtml.php#L1979-L1981\r\n\r\nHowever that `$value !== null` condition is not included for `data` array attribute values:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/d97a160bcea8663ecf3db051e9d92c710c8ce1d9/framework/helpers/BaseHtml.php#L1962-L1964\r\n\r\nAs such, these two calls result in different things:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nHtml::renderTagAttributes([\r\n    'data-baz' => null,\r\n]);\r\n// => (empty)\r\n\r\nHtml::renderTagAttributes([\r\n    'data' => [\r\n        'baz' => null,\r\n    ]\r\n]);\r\n// => data-baz=\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. Call BaseHtml::renderTagAttributes(), passing a `data` attribute set to an array, with a nested `null` value.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nThe attribute should be omitted from the rendered HTML.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nThe attribute is included, set to an empty string.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.31\r\n| PHP version      | n/a\r\n| Operating system | n/a\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
