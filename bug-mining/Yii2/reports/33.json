What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n``` php\n$form = ActiveForm::begin([\n    'id' => 'contact-form',\n    'enableAjaxValidation' => true,\n]);\necho $form->field($model, 'email');\n```\n### What is the expected result?\n\nTutorial: It will trigger an AJAX request in the background to validate the input while keeping the same user experience as the regular client-side validation.\n### What do you get instead?\n\nClient validation does not work. Can enter the an email in the wrong format. Immediately a request is sent to the server side.\n### Additional info\n\n| Yii 2.0.7      | \n| PHP 5.4      | \n| Ubuntu | \n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
