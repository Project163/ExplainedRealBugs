you considering to remove prefix model name from name of active input. I mean, when we have model `User` and attribute `name`, then the generated input name is `\"[User]name\"`. Whould you just generate `\"name\"` as input name. Since we have `safe` validator, IMO, its OK to have more than one model in one form without any conflicting.  \nRemove prefix name give more prety url in filtering (gridview), more compatible with several javascript plugin, more compatible with rest, etc...   \n\n> Prefix name use to avoid attribute collision between to model in one form.\n\nWell... Is any someone who have that case? Have to models with same attribute but provide different value?\n","closed_by":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11466/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11466/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
