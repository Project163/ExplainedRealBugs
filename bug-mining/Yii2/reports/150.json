What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nUse boolean value in return from a rest controller.\n\n``` php\nreturn [\n    'success' => false,\n    'data' => [\n        'reason' => 'No authentication configured.',\n    ]\n];\n```\n### What is the expected result?\n\n``` xml\n<response>\n    <success>0</success>\n    <data>\n        <reason>No authentication configured.</reason>\n    </data>\n</response>\n```\n### What do you get instead?\n\nIn case of true value I see 1 returned. I expected to see 0 returned for false. Would it be more correct or empty value is correct enough?\n\nI understand that PHP itself converts false to an empty string. I'm trying to question from the XML consumer side what is the desired output format.\n\n``` xml\n<response>\n    <success></success>\n    <data>\n        <reason>No authentication configured.</reason>\n    </data>\n</response>\n```\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.x |\n| PHP version | any |\n| Operating system | any |\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12856/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12856/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
