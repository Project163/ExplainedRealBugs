is `yii\\db\\Command:execute()` and related methods always call `getRawSql()` to log the query: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/db/Command.php#L830\nOf course, `Yii::info()` is always called, even if there is no related log target.\n\nThis is for just 3.000 large rows inserted (in one query), adds a 9 second overhead. :boom:
