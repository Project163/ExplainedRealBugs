change introduced in cf1600411cbf71d1c28f81b64430b6319eef5f6e has broke all our REST apps which use `v1/...` as endpoint since we were using camel2words to build url patterns. The same will happen in all other apps which use `Inflector::camel2words` and `Inflector::slug` to generate url or tokens.\r\n\r\nA change to a so older function should be done with a parameter or a warning in upgrade notes. I suggest adding a warning to upgrade notes.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nHaving a module named `v1`, create patterns for url from classes namespaces and the use of `Inflector::camel2words` and `Inflector::slug` to convert, i.e; `v1/customerOrders/index` to `v1/customer-orders/index`.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n`v1/default/index` returns `DefaultController::actionIndex`\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nThe action is not being resolved by real controller, because the patterns generated are `v-1/customer-orders/index`, but only fails on POST requests.\r\n```\r\n{\"name\":\"Method Not Allowed\",\"message\":\"Method Not Allowed.
