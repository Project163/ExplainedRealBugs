function check count($column), normalize it by reset($column) and call buildValues.\r\n```\r\npublic function build(ExpressionInterface $expression, array &$params = [])\r\n...\r\nif ($column instanceof \\Traversable || ((is_array($column) || $column instanceof \\Countable) && count($column) > 1)) {\r\n    return $this->buildCompositeInCondition($operator, $column, $values, $params);\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (is_array($column)) {\r\n    $column = reset($column);\r\n}\r\n\r\n$sqlValues = $this->buildValues($expression, $values, $params);\r\n```\r\nBut in function buildValues $column is not normalized and equals to  `[ 0 => 'id']`\r\n```\r\nprotected function buildValues(ConditionInterface $condition, $values, &$params)\r\n{\r\n    $sqlValues = [];\r\n    $column = $condition->getColumn();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.15.1\r\n| PHP version      | 7.2\r\n| Operating system
