Right?\n\nMy problem was, I didn’t wonder about option, where there are two versions of the same language. There is nothing like that in my Czech language, so I didn’t see the need.\n\nWhich leads me to some thoughts –I’ve read on some places, I should use the long version of my language, so instead of “cs” use “cs-CZ” in app setting. So I did. In the config for console message I use “cs”, but in the end, it doesn’t matter. The query is still complicated even if it’s sett to “cs-CZ”. But if I change the app language from “cs-CZ” to “cs”, the Yii is clever enough and look at the beautiful query now (even if I'm still wondering why Yii uses the old way of joining table and not the \"join style\"):\n\n``` sql\nSELECT\n    \"t1\".\"message\" AS \"message\",\n    \"t2\".\"translation\" AS \"translation\"\nFROM\n    \"sp_source_message\" \"t1\",\n    \"sp_message\" \"t2\"\nWHERE\n    (\"t1\".\"id\" = \"t2\".\"id\")\nAND (\"t1\".\"category\" = 'app')\nAND (\"t2\".\"language\" = 'cs')\n```\n\nWell my question is – what’s the benefit of using “cs-CZ” if there isn’t any other version of “cs” language? Now it seems to be more reasonable to use only the “cs”.\n\nBut still – back to the overcomplicated query. I still thing it isn’t written good in performance wise, because the last subquery is executed for every row and it still selects the same. From my knowledge, subqueries are essential where you need to use some var from the query itself, like ID of the row or something. This isn’t the case. So in some terrible scenarios you can generate hundreds of not necessary subqueries.\n\nI can see two solutions:\n1. Do the first select first, store the ids into variable and then use it for excluding in the second part.\n2. Use groupby and order like this \n\n``` sql\n… where \"t2\".\"language\" = 'cs-CZ' OR \"t2\".\"language\" = 'cs' group by (columns without t2.language) order by t2.language\n```\n\nThen due the group by you always get only one row per language, and the “cs” (shorter) will have bigger priority due the order statemen.\n\nThe question is. What’s more efficient. I believe the first one.\n\nAnd the last thing – there is still open question about the indexes. What do you think about it?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/224875618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OndrejVasicek","id":3864012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3864012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek","html_url":"https://github.com/OndrejVasicek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/224881807","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11725#issuecomment-224881807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11725","id":224881807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDg4MTgwNw==","user":{"login":"OndrejVasicek","id":3864012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3864012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek","html_url":"https://github.com/OndrejVasicek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-09T12:37:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T12:37:42Z","body":"And there is still one another improvement, which crossed my mind.

Is it even possible to first collect some info, which categories are gonna be used and then select them in one query?\n\nYes, sounds like a good idea.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/224882146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/226224928","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11725#issuecomment-226224928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11725","id":226224928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjIyNDkyOA==","user":{"login":"OndrejVasicek","id":3864012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3864012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek","html_url":"https://github.com/OndrejVasicek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-15T15:32:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T15:32:02Z","body":"Ok. I did my homework. Here are some specs:\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| DB engine | Postgre 9.4.5. |\n| Yii version | 2.0.8 |\n| System | Win 10 |\n| Hardware | Local PC with SSD disc; QuadCore 4,3Ghz; 16GB RAM |\n\nTest sourceMessage table has 19100 entries. 5 different categories – 10 000, 5 000, 3 000, 1 000, 100. Table messages has 5 languages, which is almost 100k entries in total. \n\nThis of course isn’t real life example. But it can help see the results more clearly. On the other hand, the speed on busy or shared server without SSD could be also rapidly slower.\nEvery single query was executed right after PostgreSQL restart. So no internal cache was applied (tested). 5 runs for every query combination to see the range.\n\n**Queries:**\n- Query 1: the original one – see above\n- Query 2: Splits the two selects. From first, takes the id, which uses in the second instead of the subquery – see above.\n- Query2: Using the group by with orderby – see above.\n\nQueries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE results: [yii2-messages-queries.zip](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/files/316427/yii2-messages-queries.zip)\n\nHere are some results. I’ve compared all 3 queries on indexed and non-indexed tables. I’ve also done variations for the biggest category and smallest, because there are some big differences. Not only the amount of data varies, but even the internal optimizer of PostgreSQL changes the complexity of internal query as you can see in EXPLAIN. But it can vary a lot depending on db engine.\n\n**Tables without Index:** \n- **Query 1**\n  - Smallest category: 33 – 37 ms\n  - Biggest category: 58 – 72 ms\n- **Query 2**\n  - Smallest category: \n    1. 7 - 11 ms\n    2.  9 – 11 ms\n  - Biggest category:\n    1.  20 – 26 ms\n    2.  40 – 44 ms\n- **Query 3**\n  *Smallest category: 9-21ms\n  - Biggest category: 89 - 90 (ups :) )\n  - Biggest category light (without GROUP BY and ORDER – we can easily manage it in PHP): 44 – 45 ms.\n\n**Tables with index** (message.language, source_message.category):\n- **Query 1**\n  - Smallest category: 5 – 6 ms\n  - Biggest category: 36 – 38 ms\n- **Query 2**\n  - Smallest category: \n    1.  5 - 10 ms\n    2.  6 – 9 ms\n  - Biggest category:\n    1.  5 – 11 ms\n    2.  37 – 42 ms\n- **Query 3**\n  - Smallest category: 5-7ms\n  - Biggest category: 78 – 85 (ups again :) )\n  - Biggest category light (without GROUP BY and ORDER – we can easily manage it in PHP): 35 – 41 ms.\n\n**My conclusions?**\n- The real life impact with any of these queries will be probably small. With cache turned on I’d easily turn my sight away.\n- There really are some positive differences in my optimized queries, but also some drawbacks, depending on the size of category\n- Buuuut everything fades out, when indexes come on stage.\n\n**My suggestion?**\n\nLet’s just apply the two indexes. It has only positives, no drawbacks.\nWhat do you think about that?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/226224928/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OndrejVasicek","id":3864012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3864012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek","html_url":"https://github.com/OndrejVasicek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/226268977","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11725#issuecomment-226268977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11725","id":226268977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjI2ODk3Nw==","user":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-15T18:00:18Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T18:00:18Z","body":"I'm all for it.
