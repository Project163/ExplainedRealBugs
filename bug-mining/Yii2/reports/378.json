using dotted parameters without parameter formatting everything works fine e.g.\r\n\r\n`Yii::t('app', 'date: {dt.test}', ['dt.test' => time()])`\r\n\r\nBut when you add a parameter the formatter skips this placeholder and displays it without replacing the value provided.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nYii::t('app', 'date: {dt.test,date}', ['dt.test' => time()])\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nTo display a string like: \"date: Jun 9, 2017\"\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nDisplays \"date: {dt.test,date}\"\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nThe problem lies in the  format method of I18N class on lie 112. The expression is` preg_match('~{\\s*[\\w]+\\s*,~u', $message)` and should be `preg_match('~{\\s*[\\w.]+\\s*,~u', $message)`.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.13-dev\r\n| PHP version      |  7.0.1\r\n| Operating system | Windows 10\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
