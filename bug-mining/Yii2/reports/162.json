is a current content of `testValidateWithEmpty()` in `ValidatorTest`:\n\n``` php\npublic function testValidateWithEmpty()\n{\n    $val = new TestValidator([\n        'attributes' => [\n            'attr_runMe1',\n            'attr_runMe2',\n            'attr_empty1',\n            'attr_empty2'\n        ],\n        'skipOnEmpty' => true,\n    ]);\n    $model = $this->getTestModel(['attr_empty1'

$this->assertTrue($val->isAttributeValidated('attr_empty1'));\n    $this->assertTrue($val->isAttributeValidated('attr_empty2'));\n}\n```\n\nTake a look at these 2 identical lines:\n\n``` php\n$model = $this->getTestModel(['attr_empty1' => '', 'attr_emtpy2' => ' ']);\n```\n\nAt first I thought that `attr_emtpy` is written with typo, but after changing that tests broke at this line:\n\n``` php\n$this->assertFalse($val->isAttributeValidated('attr_empty2'));\n```\n\nSo if it's a typo this is an error in test and it's passing because of 2 related errors in 2 different places. And I'm pretty sure the second line containing `attr_emtpy2` was copy pasted.\n\nOne more question. Having whitespace in `attr_emtpy2` was conceived, right?\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12848/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12848/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
