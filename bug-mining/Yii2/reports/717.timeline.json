of b642a384fa0184c58343f1d07e3d7007639fd700, InlineValidator is now binding closures to the model being validated:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/700ac0270644f8c7fe7a52f67ecfe8546ef86f37/framework/validators/InlineValidator.php#L76-L78\r\n\r\nThis is a change in behavior from prior versions which was not mentioned in the upgrade notes. It can lead to PHP errors from validation methods that were registered from a different class.\r\n\r\nFor example, Craft allows event-based rule registration with an `EVENT_DEFINE_RULES` event in `craft\\base\\Model::rules()`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/68d7e40efc7630fc319a27e0536426028d7baa50/src/base/Model.php#L78-L89\r\n\r\nSo now if an inline validation rule is added via that event, like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nEvent::on(Entry::class, Entry::EVENT_DEFINE_RULES, function(DefineRulesEvent $e) {\r\n    $e->rules[] = ['title', function() {\r\n        $this->someMethod();\r\n    }];\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nA PHP error will occur, since `$this` within the callable is no longer a reference to the same class that the event handler was registered in; it will be the Entry object.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. Add a way for other classes to register validation rules to a model’s `rules()` method.\r\n2. From a different class, register an inline validation rule on that model, which expects `$this` to be the rule was originally defined in.\r\n3. Validate the model.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\n`$this` references the class the rule was defined in.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n`$this` references the model’s class.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.36\r\n| PHP version      | n/a\r\n| Operating system |
