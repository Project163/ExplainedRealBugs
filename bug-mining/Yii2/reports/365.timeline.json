came about while trying to set BasicAuth in the GraphQL module, but applies to general BasicAuth (otherAuths?) - see the discussion on Slack#graphql with @robbieaverill, who suggested  I might create this issue. Core, documentation or nothing? :)\r\n\r\n## Affected Version\r\n3.x, 4.x\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWith PHP_CGI, the Authorization header isn't set properly: It is set to REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION instead of HTTP_AUTHORIZATION, and this means that PHP_AUTH_USER and PHP_AUTH_PW, that are calculated based on HTTP_AUTHORIZATION,  aren't set. Thes $_SERVER variables are used in class BasicAuth.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple solutions thinkable to this problem, some of which could live in core, and others coudn't but could possibly be documented? At least it took me a while to figure this out and find a solution that worked for me. For instance:\r\n\r\nOn MAMP this worked in index.php:\r\n\r\n    if (!empty($_SERVER['REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'])) {\r\n        $_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'] = $_SERVER['REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd this in httpd.conf (but not in htaccess):\r\n   \r\n    SetEnvIf Authorization “(.*)” HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nPHP_CGI
