commit 12763a146ebc550963b5d368633539701e7884ec breaks `DbSession` in some cases.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nCalling  the public function `regenerateID($deleteOldSession = false)` without an existing session will crash.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n```php\r\npublic function regenerateID($deleteOldSession = false)\r\n    {\r\n        $oldID = session_id();\r\n\r\n        // if no session is started, there is nothing to regenerate\r\n        if (empty($oldID)) {\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        parent::regenerateID(false);\r\n        $newID = session_id();\r\n        // if session id regeneration failed, no need to create/update it.\r\n        if (empty($newID)) {\r\n            Yii::warning('Failed to generate new session ID', __METHOD__);\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        $row = $this->db->useMaster(function() use ($oldID) {\r\n            return (new Query())->from($this->sessionTable)\r\n               ->where(['id' => $oldID])\r\n               ->createCommand($this->db)\r\n               ->queryOne();\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        if ($row !== false) {\r\n            if ($deleteOldSession) {\r\n                $this->db->createCommand()\r\n                    ->update($this->sessionTable, ['id' => $newID], ['id' => $oldID])\r\n                    ->execute();\r\n            } else {\r\n                $row['id'] = $newID;\r\n                $this->db->createCommand()\r\n                    ->insert($this->sessionTable, $row)\r\n                    ->execute();\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            // shouldn't reach here normally\r\n            $this->db->createCommand()\r\n                ->insert($this->sessionTable, $this->composeFields($newID, ''))\r\n                ->execute();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is valid to call `regenerateID()` before a session was ever written to the database. The code above tries to retrieve the existing row from the database, but if that fails it goes to the clause annotated with `// shouldn't reach here normally`.\r\n\r\nThe issue with this path is that it doesn't go through the `writeSession` implementation, but instead uses its own implementation of just calling `composeFields`.\r\n\r\nInside `writeSession` there is a lot more happening:\r\n```php\r\n            if ($this->writeCallback && !$this->fields) {\r\n                $this->fields = $this->composeFields();\r\n            }\r\n            // ensure data consistency\r\n            if (!isset($this->fields['data'])) {\r\n                $this->fields['data'] = $data;\r\n            } else {\r\n                $_SESSION = $this->fields['data'];\r\n            }\r\n            // ensure 'id' and 'expire' are never affected by [[writeCallback]]\r\n            $this->fields = array_merge($this->fields, [\r\n                'id' => $id,\r\n                'expire' => time() + $this->getTimeout(),\r\n            ]);\r\n            $this->fields = $this->typecastFields($this->fields);\r\n            $this->db->createCommand()->upsert($this->sessionTable, $this->fields)->execute();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifically special code is executed to ALWAYS set `id` and `expire`.\r\n\r\nSo we have 1 code path `regenerateId` that doesn't always set `id` and `expire` and another that does.\r\nThis makes it so that when `expire` is a column in a database, without a default value, the `regenerateId` path fails.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.44\r\n| PHP version      | \r\n| Operating system |\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
