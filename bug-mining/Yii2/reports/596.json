warning that you get when upgrading to 2.0.20 is in my opinion very unclear:\r\n\r\n> yii\\db\\Query::select() and addSelect() now normalize the columns when saving them to $this->select, so code that works directly with that property directly may need to be modified.\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean? What is \"normalize\" in this regard (the word \"normalize\" is not even mentioned once on the respective [guide page](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/db-query-builder)). The docs for the `Query::normalizeSelect()` don't help either:\r\n\r\n> Normalizes the SELECT columns passed to [[select()]] or [[addSelect()]].\r\n\r\nCan we please get a more clear message here including examples etc.? The warning should also include bad examples that require action.","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
