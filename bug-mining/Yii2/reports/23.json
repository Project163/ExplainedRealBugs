got a `$classMap` extension of `HtmlPurifier` where I set some defaults in the `configure` method. e.g.\n\n``` php\nprotected static function configure($config)\n{\n    $config->set('HTML.SafeIframe', true);\n    $config->set('URI.SafeIframeRegexp', '%//(www.youtube.com/embed/|player.vimeo.com/video/)%');\n}\n```\n\nI was then trying to add a new element using the closure config,\n\n``` php\n<?= HtmlPurifier::process($content, function(HTMLPurifier_Config $config) {\n    $def = $config->getHTMLDefinition(true);\n    $def->addElement('input', 'Inline', 'Empty', [], ['checked' => 'Bool#checked', 'name' => 'CDATA', 'type' => 'Enum#radio']);\n}) ?>\n```\n\nThis kept failing and the `<input type=\"radio\" />` was lost. I eventually tracked this down to `$config->set('HTML.SafeIframe', true);` in the `configure` method.\nIt seems `HTMLPurifier` was clearing a definition instance so my call to `addElement` was lost.\n\nSwapping the execution order so the `configure` method is called first fixed my issue.\n\nFrom\n\n``` php\n//....  \nif ($config instanceof \\Closure) {\n    call_user_func($config, $configInstance);\n}\nstatic::configure($configInstance);\n//....\n```\n\nTo\n\n``` php\n//....\nstatic::configure($configInstance);        \nif ($config instanceof \\Closure) {\n    call_user_func($config, $configInstance);\n}\n//....\n```\n\nCan anyone else see an issue by swapping the order?\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11052/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
