currently uses long type names for int/bool in doc blocks:\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/internals/core-code-style.md#44-doc-blocks\n\nI adopted this standard, however it always meant a certain discomfort for me since PhpStorm auto-generates PHPDoc stubs using shot type names. It made me submit a feature request to JetBrains to support long type names in auto-generated PHPDoc. Upon this request I was suggested to reconsider the usage of the long form at all as PHP 7 allows only the short form for type hinting.\n\nThus, I would suggest to consider this change in the Yii Code Style standards as well.\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12055/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12055/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
