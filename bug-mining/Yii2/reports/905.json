Open a connection to the imap server and call the imap_fetch_overview function with an invalid sequence param, for example:\r\n```\r\n$imap = imap_open(...\r\nimap_fetch_overview($imap, '-');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nWe expect to see a fatal error generated by the imap module:\r\n```\r\nPHP Fatal error:  Uncaught yii\\base\\ErrorException: PHP Request Shutdown: Sequence out of range (errflg=2) in Unknown:0\r\nStack trace:\r\n#0 [internal function]: yii\\base\\ErrorHandler->handleError()\r\n#1 {main}\r\n  thrown in Unknown on line 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nWe see that instead of a fatal error in the imap module, we get the following error in the ErrorHandler module in yii2:\r\n```\r\nPHP Fatal error:  Uncaught yii\\base\\UnknownPropertyException: Setting unknown property: yii\\console\\ErrorHandler::_memoryReserve in /app/vendor/yiisoft/yii2/base/Component.php:209\r\nStack trace:\r\n#0 /app/vendor/yiisoft/yii2/base/ErrorHandler.php(115): yii\\base\\Component->__set()\r\n#1 /app/vendor/yiisoft/yii2/base/ErrorHandler.php(139): yii\\base\\ErrorHandler->unregister()\r\n#2 [internal function]: yii\\base\\ErrorHandler->handleException()\r\n#3 {main}\r\n  thrown in /app/vendor/yiisoft/yii2/base/Component.php on line 209\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nThe problem is not reproducible in php 8.2 and apparently versions below.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.49.3\r\n| PHP version      | 8.3.4\r\n| Operating system | Debian bullseye (php:8.3-fpm-bullseye)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
