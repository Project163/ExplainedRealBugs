not sure if this is a bug or а missing feature, but i'm not able to specify `after('column_name')` using the console command yii migrate/crate\r\n\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n    yii migrate/create add_base_payment_column_to_cost_center_employee_table --migrationPath=backend/modules/costCenterEmployee/migrations --fields=\"base_payment:decimal(10,4):notNull:defaultValue(0):after('payment')\" --interactive=0\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\n    $this->addColumn('{{%cost_center_employee}}', 'base_payment', $this->decimal(10,4)->notNull()->defaultValue(0)->after('payment'));\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n    $this->addColumn('{{%cost_center_employee}}', 'base_payment', $this->decimal(10,4)->notNull()->defaultValue(0):after('payment'));\r\n\r\nInstead of \"arrow\" generator puts colon. \r\nHowever if i generate migration like this `--fields=\"base_payment:decimal(10,4):notNull:defaultValue(0)->after('payment')\"` it is genrated correctly\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n|
