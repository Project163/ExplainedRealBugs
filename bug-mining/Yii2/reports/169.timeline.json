raw.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/261463979/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikehaertl","id":675062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTA2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/675062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl","html_url":"https://github.com/mikehaertl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikehaertl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":863952659,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODYzOTUyNjU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/863952659","actor":{"login":"dynasource","id":125726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTcyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource","html_url":"https://github.com/dynasource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-18T07:09:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":863952660,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg2Mzk1MjY2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/863952660","actor":{"login":"dynasource","id":125726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTcyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource","html_url":"https://github.com/dynasource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-18T07:09:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/261468892","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13036#issuecomment-261468892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13036","id":261468892,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTQ2ODg5Mg==","user":{"login":"nkostadinov","id":1700251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDAyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1700251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov","html_url":"https://github.com/nkostadinov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T07

Response::FORMAT_RAW);\n}\n```\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/261475529/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"klimov-paul","id":1482054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul","html_url":"https://github.com/klimov-paul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/261477936","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13036#issuecomment-261477936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13036","id":261477936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTQ3NzkzNg==","user":{"login":"dynasource","id":125726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTcyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource","html_url":"https://github.com/dynasource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T08:42:20Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T08:42:20Z","body":"> Keyword render means there is some processing of some entity composing output.\n\nIf you look at the current render() methods, you are right that there is always some processing going on. \n\nHowever, most people consider the `render` functions as the solution to `render` something to a output. This is also supported by the translation of the term `render`:\n- to give: give, deliver, impart, lend, render, afford\n- to show: represent, reproduce, render, give voice to, describe\n\nWith this and consistency in mind, I would expect such a method to include the `render` terminology, whether it's doing some processing or not. As a new developer I surely would overlook a function like `responseData`\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/261477936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dynasource","id":125726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTcyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource","html_url":"https://github.com/dynasource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/261480067","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13036#issuecomment-261480067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13036","id":261480067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTQ4MDA2Nw==","user":{"login":"nkostadinov","id":1700251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDAyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1700251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov","html_url":"https://github.com/nkostadinov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkostadinov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T08:54:14Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T08:55:13Z","body":"@klimov-paul the data itself has nothing to do with the format if you name it responseData should be very confusing.
