The handler of an event at me also anonymous function, but an event does not get rid and by a repeated call I receive a mistake.\r\nIt turns out that the behavior got rid, and the event does not, because of here such check in the class [Component](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/base/Component.php#L563)\r\n```\r\nif ($event[0] === $handler) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nI replaced Closure with a class function, but was unpleasantly surprised by this behavior. Maybe add this remark to the documentation or fix this error?\r\n\r\nYii version : 2.0.16\r\nPHP version:  5.6/7.1","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
