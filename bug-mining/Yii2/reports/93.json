What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nAfter fix issue #10681, event `beforeValidate` will called after blur on any field with enabled client validation. But `afterValidate` will not called. For example, this code does not work now:\n\n``` javascript\n    // Form submition with enabling/disabling submit-button to prevent request multisend\n    $(document).on('beforeValidate', 'form', function (event, messages, deferreds) {\n        console.log('beforeValidate');\n        $(this).find('[type=submit]').attr('disabled','disabled');\n    }).on('afterValidate', 'form', function (event, messages, errorAttributes) {\n        console.log('afterValidate');\n        if (errorAttributes.length) {\n            alert('Check form errors!');\n            $(this).find('[type=submit]').removeAttr('disabled');\n        }\n    }).on('beforeSubmit', 'form', function (event) {\n        console.log('beforeSubmit');\n        $(this).find('[type=submit]').attr('disabled','disabled');\n    });\n```\n\nIn result, button will disabled after blur on first field with clientValidationRule.\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.9 |\n| PHP version | 5.5.30 |\n| Operating system | Windows 7, Ubuntu 14.04 |\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11972/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
