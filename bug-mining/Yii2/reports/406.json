This seems not to be RFC conform.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nAccess any protected resource in Yii2 using HttpBearerAuth, sending a non-existing authentication token in the HTTP request.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nAccording to [OAuth 2.0 RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750), a web service must always respond with WWW-Authenticate if an access token is missing or invalid.\r\n\r\n> If the protected resource request does not include authentication\r\ncredentials or does not contain an access token that enables access\r\nto the protected resource, the resource server MUST include the HTTP\r\n\"WWW-Authenticate\" response header field;\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nYou get a 401 error without any authentication challenge.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nThe missing authentication challenge is especially a problem for clients when session tokens expire. Clients cannot refresh a session token when they receive 401, because there is no authentication challenge.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.13\r\n| PHP version      | 7.0\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
