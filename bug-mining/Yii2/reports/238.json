found this issue during writing tests for `yii.js`.\r\n\r\nCurrently in `yii.js` we have `reloadableScripts` property used in `initScriptFilter()` function. It supports wildcards since https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/commit/ea0c6d7a1a5e1b8c20c9bbfef495892b1e1b2564:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * List of JS or CSS URLs that can be loaded multiple times via AJAX requests.\r\n * Each item may be represented as either an absolute URL or a relative one.\r\n * Each item may contain a wildcart matching character `*`, that means one or more\r\n * any characters on the position. For example:\r\n *  - `/css/*.js` will match any file ending with `.js` in the `css` directory of the current web site\r\n *  - `http*://cdn.example.com/*` will match any files on domain `cdn.example.com`, loaded with HTTP or HTTPS\r\n *  - `/js/myCustomScript.js?realm=*` will match file `/js/myCustomScript.js` with defined `realm` parameter\r\n */\r\nreloadableScripts: [],\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this statement in JSDoc:\r\n\r\n> Each item may contain a wildcart matching character `*`, that means **one or more** * any characters on the position.\r\n\r\ncontradicts with reality.\r\n\r\n`0` characters is allowed, so when we set:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nyii.reloadableScripts = ['/js/*.js'];\r\n```\r\n\r\n`/js/.js` will be a valid combination.\r\n\r\nExample for easier reproducing:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction escapeRegExp(str) {\r\n    return str.replace(/[\\-\\[\\]\\/\\{\\}\\(\\)\\*\\+\\?\\.\\\\\\^\\$\\|]/g, \"\\\\$&\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar rule = '/js/*.js';\r\nvar url = '/js/.js';\r\nvar match = new RegExp(\"^\" + escapeRegExp(rule).split('\\\\*').join('.*') + \"$\").test(url);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`match` will have a value `true`. Looks like a bug for me.","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13306/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
