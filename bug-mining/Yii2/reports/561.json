I have set `$appendTimestamp = true`\r\n\r\nSemantically, I would expect a function called publish, which returns a URL, to give a final URL with all amendments\r\n\r\nFurthermore, both the parameter name used to append the timestamp, 'v', and the code itself, are hardcoded deep in the `AssetManager::getAssetUrl()`, so it's not extensible\r\n\r\nIt appears that lots of people are hitting this issue. Could you at the least open this up for extension by separating the code into a protected or public function, like `AssetManager::appendTimestamp($url)`\r\n\r\n It would also be nice to have a `public $appendTimestampParam = 'v'` so that this can be configured too\r\n\r\n*I love your framework, but I often run into situations where code is not separated into functions or variables. Extending the framework often requires copying copying whole chunks of code into overridden functions, or just replacing files wholesale*\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
