[E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]\r\n */\r\n$auth_token = $this->getHeaders()->get('HTTP_AUTHORIZATION') ?: $this->getHeaders()->get('REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION');\r\n```\r\n**The problem is that HTTP_AUTHORIZATION and REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION are not HEADERS, but environment variables!** \r\n\r\nIn the yii\\web\\Request::getHeaders() HTTP headers parsed by\r\n`getallheaders()`\r\nor\r\n`http_get_request_headers()`\r\nor\r\ncustom expression `(strncmp($name, 'HTTP_', 5) === 0)` -

Get auth data from 'Authorization' header not from env vars, replace\r\n```\r\n$auth_token = $this->getHeaders()->get('HTTP_AUTHORIZATION') ?: $this->getHeaders()->get('REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION');\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n`$auth_token = $this->getHeaders()->get('Authorization');`\r\n\r\n2. Update custom headers parser and add expression for 'REDIRECT_HTTP_' prefix:\r\n`(strncmp($name, 'HTTP_', 5) === 0 || strncmp($name, 'REDIRECT_HTTP_', 14) === 0)`","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
