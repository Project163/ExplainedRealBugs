recently upgraded to 2.0.10 and I noticed some weird behaviour with my form submissions; my forms would no longer submit unless I was submitting them via an AJAX procedure.\n\nSo I did some debugging, on all my _non-ajax_ forms I have this binded to them...\n\n```\n$('form').not('.js-ajax').on('submit', function(e) {\n    // Disable submit button\n    $(e.target).find('button[type=submit], input[type=submit]').prop('disabled', true);\n});\n```\n\nSo as you can probably tell it disables the submit button when the user submits the form; if I comment out this code then the form will _now_ **submit**; but the forms were submitting fine on 2.0.9 with this code enabled, which I confirmed by going back and forth between 2.0.9 and 2.0.10.\n\nNow you ask what does this have to do with ActiveForm? Well this only happens on forms made with ActiveForm - I have a _non-ajax_ form done _without_ ActiveForm and it submits fine.\n\nSo, a summary:\n## 2.0.10\n\nForm submitted via AJAX: **works**\nForm made with ActiveForm _with_ submit button disabling: **Doesn't work**\nForm made with ActiveForm _without_ submit button disabling: **Works**\nForm NOT made with ActiveForm: **works**\n## 2.0.9 and below\n\n**All situations work**\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nCreate standard and ActiveForm forms to test - test ActiveForm forms with and without submit button disabling on submit.\n### What is the expected result?\n\nForm sbumits.\n### What do you get instead?\n\nForms you build with ActiveForm AND disable the submit button on submit don't submit.\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.10 |\n| PHP version | 5.5.28 |\n| Operating system | Win 7 |\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12803/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12803/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
