Use this SqlDataProvider in GridView\r\n3. Click on column is_deleted\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n1. Error in sql-query with TWO `ORDER BY` instructions - `ORDER BY \"f\".\"rappart\" ORDER BY \"f\".\"ris_deleted\" DESC LIMIT 25`\r\n\r\n### Research\r\n1. Error in `SqlDataProvider->prepareModels()` method\r\n2. Do not understand why pattern `/\\s+order\\s+by\\s+([\\w\\s,\\.]+)$/i` not work correctly\r\n3. When i'm add `preg_match_all($pattern, $sql, $matches); var_dump($matches); die();` after `$pattern = '/\\s+order\\s+by\\s+([\\w\\s,\\.]+)$/i';` line and refresh page i see empty `$matches` array\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.41.1\r\n| PHP version      | 7.4.10 \r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18552/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
