What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n$form->field($model, 'attribute')->radioList($model->arrAttributeOptions)\n$form->field($model, 'attribute2')->checkboxList($model->arrAttribute2Options)\n### What is the expected result?\n\nFor example, the checkbox list active field produces this (note label and hidden input):\n\n```\n<div class=\"form-group field-modelname-attributename\">\n   <label class=\"control-label\" for=\"modelname-attributename\">Attribute Label</label>\n   <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"Modelname[attributename]\" value=\"\">\n   <div id=\"modelname-attributename\">\n       <div class=\"radio\"><label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"Modelname[attributename]\" value=\"attributevalue1\" checked> attributevaluelabel1</label></div>\n       <div class=\"radio\"><label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"Modelname[attributename]\" value=\"attributevalue2\"> attributevaluelabel2</label></div>\n       <div class=\"radio\"><label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"Modelname[attributename]\" value=\"attributevalue3\"> attributevaluelabel3</label></div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n```\n### What do you get instead?\n\nGo to a w3C validator: \"Error: The for attribute of the label element must refer to a non-hidden form control.\"\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | yii2.05 |\n| PHP version | PHP 5.5.9 |\n| Operating system |
