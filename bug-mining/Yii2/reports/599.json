got a `Module` with some `UrlRule`'s to work with a subdomain.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\nsite.com     -> DefaultController\r\nsub.site.com -> Module/DefaultController\r\n```\r\nWhen going to `sub.site.com` it will redirect to `site.com/login` which works fine.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the call to [`User::loginRequired()`](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/web/User.php#L437) only sets the relative part of the url so after logging in you get redirected back to `site.com` and not `sub.site.com`\r\n\r\nThis could be fixed by changing this line [User.php#L446](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/web/User.php#L446) to use the absolute url, not sure if this would cause any BC issues.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n|
