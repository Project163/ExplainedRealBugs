think that there is a bug in the BaseJson.php when returning the client validator in a project with iso-8859-1 charset.\n\nThe form field throws an invalid param exception if the rule for user_id was

function encode($value, $options = 320)\n    {\n        if(\\Yii::$app->charset == \"iso-8859-1\")\n            if(isset($value['message']))\n                $value['message'] =
