What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nAdd multiple dataproviders to a page, forget to set an `id`.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nPagination works.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nPagination works globally, all dataproviders get paged.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n````\r\n    /**\r\n     * @var string an ID that uniquely identifies the data provider among all data

*/\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nWhy not add a default increasing id to dataproviders in the same way as we do for widgets? There is no downside to having an ID, as far as I can tell. If needed we could even have the first `id` be the empty string so there is no BC issue.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
