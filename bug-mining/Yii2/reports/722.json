It can lead to PHP errors from validation methods that were registered from a different class.\r\n\r\nFor example, Craft allows event-based rule registration with an `EVENT_DEFINE_RULES` event in `craft\\base\\Model::rules()`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/68d7e40efc7630fc319a27e0536426028d7baa50/src/base/Model.php#L78-L89\r\n\r\nSo now if an inline validation rule is added via that event, like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nEvent::on(Entry::class, Entry::EVENT_DEFINE_RULES, function(DefineRulesEvent $e) {\r\n    $e->rules[] = ['title', function() {\r\n        $this->someMethod();\r\n    }];\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nA PHP error will occur, since `$this` within the callable is no longer a reference to the same class that the event handler was registered in; it will be the Entry object.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. Add a way for other classes to register validation rules to a model’s `rules()` method.\r\n2. From a different class, register an inline validation rule on that model, which expects `$this` to be the rule was originally defined in.\r\n3. Validate the model.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\n`$this` references the class the rule was defined in.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n`$this` references the model’s class.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.36\r\n| PHP version      | n/a\r\n| Operating system | n/a\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
