am having three tables.\n- User\n- Regions\n- Country \n#### Relations are built like below:\n- User hasMany Regions\n- Regions hasOne Country\n\nI have relation build for fetching regions of user in User Model and one more relation is there in Region Model to get related country.\n\nIf I do eager loading like this the my Primary key of region is not quoted. Let me show you waht works and what not.\n## Works:\n\n`$userModel->getRegions()->with('country')->all();` \n\nThis works may be becuase we will have separate query. Correct?\n## Field Not Quoted:\n\n`$userModel->getRegions()->joinWith('country')->all();`\n\nIn MySQL it will work but in case of PG, that is required to have the field quoted specially when you have camel casing. Have a look at generated query.\n\n`SELECT \"region\".* FROM \"region\" LEFT JOIN \"country\" ON \"region\".\"CountryID\" = \"country\".\"CountryID\" WHERE \"region\".UserID=8`\n\nYou can see that last field which is primary key of my User model is not quoted.\n\nPHP: 5.5.12\nYii2: 2.0.7\n\nAm i missing something here or its bug over there?\n","closed_by":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
