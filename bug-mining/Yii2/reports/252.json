hard to explain. But it seems there is a bug in yii2 debug info system.\r\n\r\nThis exception is raised when trying to get undefined variable in nested view. For example in yii2 basic app with YII_DEBUG sets in true you can change `contact.php` view file to render nested view `contact_form.php`. In that file try to get any undefined variable to raise an exception. Standard debug info will be \"broken\" - no color highlighting, strange rows in the end.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Install yii2-basic-app\r\n2. Set YII_DEBUG to `true`\r\n3. Change the view @app/views/site/contact.php to\r\n```\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n/* @var $this yii\\web\\View */\r\n/* @var $form yii\\bootstrap\\ActiveForm */\r\n/* @var $model app\\models\\ContactForm */\r\n\r\nuse yii\\helpers\\Html;\r\nuse yii\\bootstrap\\ActiveForm;\r\nuse yii\\captcha\\Captcha;\r\n\r\n$this->title = 'Contact';\r\n$this->params['breadcrumbs'][] = $this->title;\r\n?>\r\n\r\n<?= $this->render(\"contact_form\"); ?>\r\n```\r\n4. Create `contact_form.php` file:\r\n```\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n/* @var $this yii\\web\\View */\r\n/* @var $form yii\\bootstrap\\ActiveForm */\r\n/* @var $model app\\models\\ContactForm */\r\n\r\nuse yii\\helpers\\Html;\r\nuse yii\\bootstrap\\ActiveForm;\r\nuse yii\\captcha\\Captcha;\r\n\r\n$this->title = 'Contact';\r\n$this->params['breadcrumbs'][] = $this->title;\r\n\r\n$model->text; // <-- Exception will be throw here\r\n?>\r\n<div class=\"site-contact\">\r\n...\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n5. Navigate to `/index.php?r=site%2Fcontact` and see broken (not fully colored) debug view.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nCorrect standard debug view.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nBroken (not fully colored) debug view.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.11.2?\r\n| PHP version      | 7.0.15\r\n| Operating system | Debian 8.1.\r\n\r\nThis bug is appearing **ONLY** in nested views. If you try to call `$model->text` in main `contact.php` file nothing obvious happens. The debug view will be draw perfectly.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
