`2.0.6` all my migrations run fine, however after getting the `2.0.7` update it fails after the first migration when trying to create entry in `migration` table.\n\nIn testing I removed all my migrations and created a new empty one that looks like:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n\nuse yii\\db\\Migration;\n\nclass m160223_195340_testing207 extends Migration\n{\n    public function up()\n    {\n    }\n\n    public function down()\n    {\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI dropped my database and started fresh as well, here is the output of running `./yii migrate --interactive=0`:\n\n```\n$ ./yii migrate --interactive=0\nYii Migration Tool (based on Yii v2.0.7)\n\nCreating migration history table \"migration\"...Done.\nTotal 1 new migration to be applied:\n    m160223_195340_testing207\n\n*** applying
