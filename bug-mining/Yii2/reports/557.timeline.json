`S3_KEY`).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/465989805/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brandonkelly","id":47792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly","html_url":"https://github.com/brandonkelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2154877406,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE1NDg3NzQwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/2154877406","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-21T12:56:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2154877407,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNTQ4Nzc0MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/2154877407","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-21T12:56:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/465999109","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17150#issuecomment-465999109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17150","id":465999109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTk5OTEwOQ==","user":{"login":"bizley","id":8577314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzczMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8577314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley","html_url":"https://github.com/bizley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-21T13:28:06Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T13:29:55Z","body":"While

the correct camel case is handled as an actual camel case. Supporting everything else is additional value to the method, it does not affect the main purpose of it. But ignoring case (just a reminder - the case of the letters indicates word separators in camel case, so it is crucial for detecting words) and trying to guess words by using fancy regexp is something completely different - you're breaking the main purpose of this method by introducing some magic behavior. It is only a matter of time when someone hits an edge case when this will not work as expected.\r\n\r\nIf this is all about ALLCAPS strings, I suggest to lowercase them and then use old regexp to detect words - it should cover `LEAD` and `S3_KEY` and does not affect most of the edge cases with actual camel case.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/466217909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rob006","id":5972388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzIzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006","html_url":"https://github.com/rob006","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/466231590","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17150#issuecomment-466231590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17150","id":466231590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjIzMTU5MA==","user":{"login":"brandonkelly","id":47792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly","html_url":"https://github.com/brandonkelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandonkelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-22T01:03:02Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T01:03:02Z","body":"Again I remind you that up until 2.0.16, the regex had a specific check for consecutive capital letters.
