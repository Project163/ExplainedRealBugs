believe this only affects `InConditionBuilder` and `LikeConditionBuilder`.\r\n\r\nUsing `InCondition` if the operator is lowercase the SQL built is `column<>:qp0` instead of `column=:qp0`\r\n```php\r\n$params = [];\r\necho \\Yii::$app->db->queryBuilder\r\n    ->buildCondition(\r\n        new \\yii\\db\\conditions\\InCondition('column', 'in', [1])\r\n    , $params);\r\n```\r\nUsing `LikeCondition` if the operator is lowercase an exception is raised.\r\n```php\r\n$params = [];\r\necho \\Yii::$app->db->queryBuilder\r\n    ->buildCondition(\r\n        new \\yii\\db\\conditions\\LikeCondition('column', 'like', 'foobar')\r\n    , $params);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould be fixed by either upper casing the operator in the condition class or using case-insensitive
