this line: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/caching/Cache.php#L569 the method signature requires `\\Closure`, however the implementation uses `call_user_func()`, for which callable is sufficient. This could be checked with `is_callable()`.\r\n\r\nAllowing any callable, rather than specifically `\\Closure`, would allow one to use an array callable. This is preferable in model objects, because closures cannot be serialized.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that serializing closures will be a future addition to Yii, but it is not ready yet. This limitation makes `getOrSet()` mostly unusable for me.","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13981/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13981/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
