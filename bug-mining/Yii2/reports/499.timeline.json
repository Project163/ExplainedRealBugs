What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nDefine two relation in some db active record model via junction table with callable:\r\n```php\r\nclass Foo extends Article\r\n{\r\n    const\r\n        FILE_RELATION_MAIN_IMAGE = 0,\r\n        FILE_RELATION_LOGO = 1;\r\n\r\n    public function getMainImage()\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->hasOne(File::class, ['file_id' => 'file_id'])->via('articleToFiles', function (ActiveQuery $query) {\r\n            return $query->where(['relation' => self::FILE_RELATION_MAIN_IMAGE]);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function getLogoImage()\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->hasOne(File::class, ['file_id' => 'file_id'])->via('articleToFiles', function (ActiveQuery $query) {\r\n            return $query->where(['relation' => self::FILE_RELATION_LOGO]);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Article extends ActiveRecord\r\n{\r\n    public function getArticleToFiles()\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->hasMany(ArticleToFile::class, ['article_id' => 'article_id'])->inverseOf('article');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ArticleToFile extends ActiveRecord {}\r\n\r\nclass File extends ActiveRecord {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nDatabase tables has:\r\n`article`: have article_id 1\r\n`file`: have file_id 1 and 2\r\n`articleToFile`: have two records:\r\n```\r\narticle_id\tfile_id\t\trelation\r\n1\t\t1\t\t0\r\n1\t\t2\t\t1\r\n```\r\nCall `$foo->mainImage->file_id` return 1\r\nCall `$foo->logoImage->file_id` return 2\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nBoth (and any next file relation call) return `1` (first result).\r\nWhen reverse calls (logoImage, then mainImage) got double `2`.\r\n\r\nWorks after rollback to 2.0.15.1.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.16\r\n| PHP version      | 7.2.x\r\n| Operating system | KDE
