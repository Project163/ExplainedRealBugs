Changes made by @darkdef resulted in adding dot (`.`) to allowed extensions when comparing them to extension of file being uploaded. It's a problem on both:\r\n1. Server-side: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blame/master/framework/validators/FileValidator.php#L418\r\n2. Client-side: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/assets/yii.validation.js#L416\r\n\r\n# What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Add to model a `file` validation rule with `extensions => ['csv', 'txt', '']` configuration\r\n2. Try uploading a file with no extension using that model\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nValidator (both client-side and server-side) should allow uploading such file, as it was prior to `2.0.36` Yii2 version\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nA `wrongExtension` failed validation message is shown - validation fails and doesn't allow uploading the file without extension.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.37\r\n| PHP version      | 7.2.31\r\n| Operating system | Windows 10 Pro\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18239/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
