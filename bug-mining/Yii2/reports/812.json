Problem is, the app being tested is a Web application, and therefore uses a `yii\\web\\Request`, leading to a `yii\\web\\NotFoundHttpException`.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense to see a `yii\\web\\...` Exception here, since `isConsoleRequest()` is true.\r\n\r\nThe confounding factor seems to be that, by default, `isConsoleRequest()` only uses `PHP_SAPI` to test its situation — which of course will reflect that we're running in the console, because we're in Codeception. But it's not _actually_ a console request; `isConsoleRequest()` has seemingly returned erroneously.\r\n\r\nIs there a way Yii could avoid tripping over this? — For example, maybe `yii\\web\\Request` could explicitly set `setIsConsoleRequest(false)` at init?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. Spin up a web app with a `yii\\web\\Request`.\r\n2. Include some problematic code:\r\n   ```php\r\n   if (Yii:app()->getRequest()->getIsConsoleRequest()) {\r\n   \t$route = ($request->resolve())[0];\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n3. Bootstrap the app in a Codeception test.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\n`getIsConsoleRequest()` should return `false`, and this branch should never execute in the first place, because we're dealing with a _web_ app, with a _web_ request component.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nRequest throws `yii\\web\\NotFoundHttpException`.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nYii 2.0.43\r\nPHP 7.4","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19096/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
