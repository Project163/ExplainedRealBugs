What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nEnable `DbCache` to a `PostgreSQL` database\r\nTurn on `enableSchemaCache` in the database connection\r\n \r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nYii2 will use the `cache` table to cache the results of its schema description queries. \r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n`yii\\base\\ErrorException`\r\n`unserialize() expects parameter 1 to be string, resource given`\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nThe cache database uses `bytea` to store the values, when loading these from a query you get back a stream rather than a value.\r\n\r\nThe `getValue` method of `DbCache` uses `queryScalar` which automatically checks for a stream and calls `stream_get_contents`.\r\n\r\nThe `getValues` method does a `queryAll` which does not do the check, which means the return values are streams rather than the underlying data.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.13.1\r\n| PHP version      | 7.1.7\r\n|
