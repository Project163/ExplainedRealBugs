The main way the docs specify to do that is by setting the `Formatter` class’s new `calendar` property to `IntlDateFormatter::TRADITIONAL`, and appending `@calendar=<calendar_type>` to the `locale` property.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `locale` property is passed to several `Yii::t()` calls within the `Formatter` class, which is only expecting a language string, not `<language>@calendar=<calendar_type>`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/940eb363ab02999ececef47733bf6e2e8d86c761/framework/i18n/Formatter.php#L389\r\n\r\nThese calls will end up causing Yii to re-load all `yii` translations messages with a different translation key that includes the `@calendar` param, and if the language happens to be more than two letters (e.g. `xx-YY`), the correct translations won’t even get loaded; `yii\\i18n\\PhpMessageSource::loadMessages()` won’t be able to find `xx-YY@calendar=<calendar_type>/yii.php` so it will fall back to `xx/yii.php` instead (if it even exists – not the case with `nb-NO`, `zh-CN`, or `zh-TW`).\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nCreate a `yii\\i18n\\Formatter` instance with a locale ID that has more than two characters, and a custom calendar type.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$formatter = new Formatter([\r\n    'locale' => 'zh-CN@calendar=persian',\r\n    'calendar' => IntlDateFormatter::TRADITIONAL,\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nThe formatter’s internal `Yii::t()` calls should ignore the `@calendar` param on the `locale` property.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n`Yii::t()` calls include the `@calendar` param in their `$language` argument.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.27\r\n| PHP version      | N/A\r\n| Operating system | N/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17585/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
