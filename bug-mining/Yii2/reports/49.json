have generated models of my database with gii so the validation rules are automatically generated based on the database constraints. Now, the models I really use extend these generated models, so my custom methods don't get overwritten when I do a datbase change and re-run gii.\n\nThe issue I'm now facing is that I want to change a validation rule.\n\nIn my generated class:\n\n``` php\n    public function rules()\n    {\n        return [\n            [['username', 'password', 'firstname', 'lastname'], 'required'],\n            [['username', 'firstname', 'lastname'], 'string', 'max' => 50],\n            [['password'], 'string', 'max' => 60],\n        ];\n    }\n```\n\nIn my extended class:\n\n``` php\n    public function rules()\n    {\n        return [\n            [['username', 'firstname', 'lastname'], 'required'],\n            [['username', 'firstname', 'lastname'], 'string', 'max' => 50],\n            [['password'], 'string', 'max' => 60],\n            [['password'], 'required', 'on' => 'create'],\n            [['password'], 'safe', 'on' => 'update'],\n        ];\n    }\n```\n\nUnfortunalty, I have to copy all the rules and when I run a db update, I have to remember to copy the rules again.\n\nIn case I only want to add a rule, I could do a `parent::rules()` and `array_merge()` them, but I can't unset a specific rule (to remove the `'password'` from the first `'required'` line). \n\nThis works nicely with `function actions()` and `function behaviors()` since they provide keys you can `unset()`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
