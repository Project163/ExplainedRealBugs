157](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/helpers/BaseStringHelper.php#L157) calls HTMLPurifier lexer->tokenizeHTML with $context set to null. It works in case of DOMLex (which depends on DOMDocument class) but in case it uses DirectLex, it tries to [call register method on null context](https://github.com/ezyang/htmlpurifier/blob/master/library/HTMLPurifier/Lexer/DirectLex.php#L79). I assume DirectLex is poorly programmed here but I think a fix should be also considered on the yii2 side, maybe something like\n\n```\n$lexer = \\HTMLPurifier_Lexer::create($config);\n$context = new \\HTMLPurifier_Context;\n$tokens = $lexer->tokenizeHTML($string, $config, $context);\n```\n\nin truncateHtml() would be sufficient.\n\n@samdark The same issue is reported [here](http://yiiframework.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=38077), btw.\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.9 |\n| PHP version | 5.6/any |\n| Operating system | Linux/any |\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12703/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
