What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nThe JSON value string inserted into the DB will be enclosed by double quotes hence it's causing the internal double quotes to be escaped.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nThe correct one should be\r\n```php\r\n[{\"level\":1,\"id\":1},{\"level\":2,\"id\":2}]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n```php\r\n\"[{\\\"level\\\":1,\\\"id\\\":1},{\\\"level\\\":2,\\\"id\\\":2}]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nHowever, I realize that If I changed the validation rule in the model class, \r\nFrom\r\n```php\r\n[['formula'],'string']\r\n```\r\nto \r\n```\r\n[['formula'],'safe']\r\n```\r\n\r\nformula is the json column name.\r\nThe value inserted into the database is correct\r\n```php\r\n[{\"level\":1,\"id\":1},{\"level\":2,\"id\":2}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter I changed the validation rule in the model class, and the insertion works.\r\nI tried to do a query search based on the same JSON data but no records found.\r\n```php\r\n$conditionArray[] = array('level'=>1,'id'=>1);\r\n$conditionArray[] = array('level'=>2,'id'=>2);\r\n$condition = new JsonExpression($conditionArray);\r\nself::find()->where(['=','formula',$condition])\r\n```\r\nI look at the logs, and the query being executed is\r\n```php\r\nSELECT * FROM `uom_formula` WHERE (`formula` = '[{\\\"level\\\":1,\\\"id\\\":1},{\\\"level\\\":2,\\\"id\\\":2}]')\r\n```\r\n\r\nArrayExpression does not work either.\r\nExpression of class `yii\\db\\ArrayExpression` can not be built in `yii\\db\\mysql\\QueryBuilder`\r\n\r\nIs this normal?\r\nAm I doing something wrong?\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.14\r\n| PHP
