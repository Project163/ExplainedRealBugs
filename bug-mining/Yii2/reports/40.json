What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nSet the host info to `NULL`.\n### What is the expected result?\n\nI expect the `getHostInfo()` function to re-determine the host info.\n### What do you get instead?\n\nAn empty string.\n### Additional info\n\nWhen configuring the request component it sometimes make sense to configure the hostinfo conditionally, for example:\n\n```\n'request' => [\n    'hostInfo' => CONSOLE ? 'http://coolstuff.com' : null\n]\n```\n\nIn this scenario when the value is set to `NULL` because `setHostInfo` trims the value, it gets set to `'\"` instead.\n\nIt's a minor change but one that makes more sense in my opinion, it never makes sense to pass in an empty string anyway since that is not a valid host name, so optionally an exception could even be thrown when setting it to an invalid hostname.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
