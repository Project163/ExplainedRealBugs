information to be logged respectively:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$_SERVER = [\r\n    'AUTH_GOOGLE_TOKEN' => '***',\r\n    'AUTH_FACEBOOK_TOKEN' => '***',\r\n    'AUTH_TWITTER_TOKEN' => '***',\r\n

hundreds) predefined variables we will only have a few entries, e.g.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n'maskVars' => [\r\n    '_SERVER.*TOKEN',\r\n    '_POST.*.password',\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it worth it?
