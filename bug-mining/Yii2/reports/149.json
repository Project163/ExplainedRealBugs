(cred_despesas must be less than cred_rendimentos)\n\nI type 1000 in cred_rendimentos, the error in cred_despesas dont disappear. (I could understand as a developer but this is not the behavior the user expects)\n\nI clear the 2 fields, type 10 in cred_despesas and see the error about it must be less than cred_rendimentos. \ncred_rendimentos is not filled, why the error? The inverse dont cause error (Enter 10 in cred_rendimentos with cred_despesas empty)\n\nSo, the issue is:\n- If an atributte A has error and has compare validator with field B, changing the field B must update the error in field A.\n- If I fill only A and dont get errors, so I dont should get error when I only fill B\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.11-dev |\n| PHP version | 5.6.24 |\n| Operating system | Windows 10 |\n","closed_by":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
