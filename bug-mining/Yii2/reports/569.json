working on hosting an Yii2 application on standard environment of Google Cloud App Engine, I got into some interesting challenges that I can solve by writing a custom `AssetManager` class (will open-source it or link it to the cook-book).\r\n\r\nFor example, this should not happen:\r\n```\r\nvar_dump(FileHelper::normalizePath('gs://bucket-name/assets/'));\r\nstring 'gs:/bucket-name/assets' (length=22)\r\n```\r\nIs it sensible to update the framework to detect custom wrappers or make the double-slash rule smarter?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
