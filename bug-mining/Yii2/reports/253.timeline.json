I made deadlock situation.\r\n\r\nI currently playing with MySQL only at first. I do the following steps (both transactions are SERIALIZABLE):\r\n\r\nprocess A | process B\r\n--- | ---\r\n`START TRANSACTION` | wait\r\n`SELECT ... WHERE id = 42` (shared lock) | wait\r\nkick process B to resume | `START TRANSACTION`\r\n`sleep(1)` | `UPDATE ... WHERE id = 42` (wait for exclusive lock)\r\n`UPDATE ... WHERE id = 42` |\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it will work for other DBMS or not. With MySQL if switch isolation to REPEATABLE READ, then `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` is required to hit deadlock, but it's MySQL specific AFAIK.\r\n\r\nI fork one child. There are currently following problems:\r\n\r\n1. I want parent process to hit deadlock, so I do bad transaction in parent (process A). It seemed logically for me: bad logic - bad result. But MySQL (unexpectedly for me) dooms harmless child process B which does correct transaction. I'm not sure is it consistent result or not. I will try to spawn two children and will do transactions there. Here I need to lift up info about expected and/or unexpected exception. I don't know how better to do this. Child exit status is not enough. I will use at first just temp files.\r\n\r\n2. In case of accident PHP's fatal error in child process phpunit continues to run all other tests there, while parent has some relax nearby inside `pcntl_waitpid()`. After that parent continues to run all the same rest tests. The output in terminal is a mess. I'm not so familar with phpunit. I'm catching `\\Exception` in child process and do `exit` anyway. I don't know how to deal with this.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/264196320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Vovan-VE","id":1166581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE","html_url":"https://github.com/Vovan-VE","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":896160384,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDg5NjE2MDM4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/896160384","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-16T02:19:37Z","milestone":{"title":"2.0.12"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":896160385,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50ODk2MTYwMzg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/896160385","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-16T02:19:37Z","milestone":{"title":"2.0.11"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/267525304","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12715#issuecomment-267525304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12715","id":267525304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzUyNTMwNA==","user":{"login":"Vovan-VE","id":1166581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE","html_url":"https://github.com/Vovan-VE","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vovan-VE/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-16T06:16:10Z","updated_at":"2016-12-16T06:16:10Z","body":"Just
