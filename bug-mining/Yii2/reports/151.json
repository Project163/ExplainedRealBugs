What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n`yii migrate/create create_products_combine_with_table  --fields=\"combine_with_id:bigPrimaryKey:unsigned,product_id:bigInteger:unsigned:notNull:foreignKey(products)\"`\n\nSome clarification - primary key of `products` table is `product_id`\nIt is generating `id` but should generate `product_id`\n### What is the expected result?\n\n```\npublic function up()\n{\n    ...\n\n    // add foreign key for table `products`\n    $this->addForeignKey(\n        'fk-products_combine_with-product_id',\n        'products_combine_with',\n        'product_id',\n        'products',\n        'product_id',\n        'CASCADE'\n    );\n}\n```\n### What do you get instead?\n\n```\npublic function up()\n{\n    ...\n\n    // add foreign key for table `products`\n    $this->addForeignKey(\n        'fk-products_combine_with-product_id',\n
