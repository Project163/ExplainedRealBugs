that, Qiang proposed a syntax\r\n- I've created a PR, which did not get merged, because of release pressure in 2.0\r\n- then there were so many changes, that the PR could not longer be merged, without even reviewing it beforehand\r\n- so I've created an extension for it\r\n- after that we had to wait over 2 years to get the feature implemented\r\n\r\nI was asking here, because supporting an alternative syntax might require a tiny tweak at the core - or not, I don't know it right from the top of my head.

To be friendly speaking the response is not what I've expected in this case from the Yii side.\r\n\r\nWe're quite busy with [574 opened issues](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues) so I see no reason why fixing 3rd party extension compatibility is significant enough.\r\n\r\n>  I think this deserves some discussion, so I'm going to reopen the issue.\r\n\r\nThe problem with extension mentioned appears in case `BaseMigrateController::$migrationNamespaces` is enabled. If author is unable to make his code compatible with this option - he should either place a restriction on the `yiisoft/yii2` package version inside the `composer.json` to exclude new core version or throw an exception inside his code in case this option is set.\r\n\r\nWe have made a decision at #384 in favor of namespaces. I can see no reason for it to be reconsidered.\r\nThe main reason - is name collisions: 2 different paths may contains the migration classes with **exact** same name. Yes it is rare thing to happen - but it is still possible.\r\n\r\nAlso `BaseMigrateController::$migrationPath` is considered as deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Why we should extend its functionality?\r\n\r\n> Also the fact that we broke the extension looks like we broke compatibility here, that should be checked.\r\n\r\nUnless the proper bug report, which proves BC break is provided I can not do anything about it.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/271317638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"klimov-paul","id":1482054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul","html_url":"https://github.com/klimov-paul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":916110809,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTE2MTEwODA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/916110809","actor":{"login":"klimov-paul","id":1482054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul","html_url":"https://github.com/klimov-paul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-09T15:44:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/271331195","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13356#issuecomment-271331195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13356","id":271331195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTMzMTE5NQ==","user":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-09T16:26:10Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T16:26:10Z","body":"@klimov-paul I understand that you consider the feature as complete as you have implemented it.
