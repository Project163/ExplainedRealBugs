updating from 2.0.13 to 2.0.14 i have noticed some strange behavior of `Query::select()`.\r\nIf you reassign select fields, duplicates will be removed like in example below:\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n```        \r\n$query = (new yii\\db\\Query())\r\n            ->select('id')\r\n            ->from('place')\r\n        ;\r\n$query->select(['id', 'brand_id']);\r\nreturn $query->one();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n```\r\n[\r\n'id' => 1,\r\n'brand_id' => 1,\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n```\r\n[\r\n'brand_id' => 1,\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n**Notice**: if define `id` inside `select` with alias in first __or__ second definition (i.e `['id_alias' => 'id']`), it will be ok and `id` will be selected.\r\n\r\nIt seems that such behavior occurs because of `Query::getUniqueColumns()`, added in 2.0.14.\r\n\r\nMaybe related with: #15674\r\n\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- |
