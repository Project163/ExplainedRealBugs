think possibly a bug (though could be something else I have done) however it does appear that:\n\nWhen ajax validation is enabled for specific individual attributes and if validation has failed such as to produce error message. Clicking submit removes errors of the ajax validated attributes if clientValidation errors are produced.\n\nWorks as expected if \n`if ($.isEmptyObject(messages) && needAjaxValidation) {\n`\nis changed to \n`if (needAjaxValidation) {\n`\n\nTo reiterate:\najaxValidation is disabled for form but enabled for some attributes e.g. phone number and address validation. Some other fields have some clientValidation.\n\nTypeing invalid data into the ajaxValidated fields triggers ajax validation as expected and errors are displayed.\n\nProblem is that clicking submit when there are failing client validated (non ajax validated attributes) seems to clear the errors of the ajax validated attributes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12499/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
