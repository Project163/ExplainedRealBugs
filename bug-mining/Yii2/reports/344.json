Let's say I have `/admin` (would log everything within backend side) or `/admin/bank/*` (would log everything within `bank` controller)  route and I would like to get all `_GET`, `_POST` requests happening in it. \r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nI would like to be able to set up this kind of structure: \r\n\r\n```php \r\n'log' => [\r\n    'targets' => [\r\n        [\r\n            'class' => 'yii\\log\\FileTarget',\r\n            // 'categories' => ['backend'], \r\n            'urlMatch' => ['/admin/*'], // <---\r\n            'logVars' => ['_GET', '_POST'],\r\n            'logFile' => '@app/runtime/backend.log',\r\n        ],\r\n    ],\r\n],\r\n```\r\nSo that covers all of the requests on the `admin/*`. \r\n\r\n> With categories, I will need to go to each controller or model and place this category to get the loggin information, which is not very comfortable. \r\n\r\nIf there is anything like this already, please provide a link, this will be useful. \r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.11\r\n| PHP version      | 5.5.9\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 14.04\r\n| Advanced app or basic     | Advanced","closed_by":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
