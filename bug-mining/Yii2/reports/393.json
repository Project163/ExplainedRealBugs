CSRF cookie just was not sent in response to requests.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that one of my files echoed some content before `View::beginPage()` call.\r\n\r\nTo find it, I had to debug through all the application up to Response::sendHeaders(), where I could find the root cause of the issue dumping `$file` and `$line` from `headers_sent($file, $line)`.\r\n\r\nThe question is: why Yii does not warn/throw an error if headers were already sent prior to `Response::send()`? This leads to silent and hard-to-debug problems.\r\n\r\nI think simple check before `$this->sendHeaders()` in `Response::send()`, that will throw an Exception if `headers_sent)` is true, will solve this issue.\r\n\r\nI can make a PR for this if this solutuion is ok.","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15046/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
