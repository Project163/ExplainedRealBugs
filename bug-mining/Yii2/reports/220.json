What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nSet a 'unique' validation rule for an attribute in a model.\r\nAdd some code that requires attributes to the afterFind() method:\r\n```php\r\npublic function afterFind() {\r\n    $this->emailUsername = $this->extractEmailUsername($this->email);\r\n}\r\n//...\r\npublic function extractEmailUsername($email)\r\n{\r\n    $username = substr($email, 0, strpos($email, '@'));\r\n    if (false !== $username) {\r\n        return $username;\r\n    } else {\r\n        throw new InvalidParamException(\"Failed to extract username from email '$email'.\");\r\n    }\r\n }\r\n```\r\nRun validation **with an existing value** for the expected-unique attribute.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nA validation failure with an error message.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nAn InvalidParamException is thrown when I validate the 'email' attribute with an existing value.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nChanges were made in this [commit](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/commit/729ddc5b76e8159d051e9c5783f5534eeb212efb)\r\n\r\n Yii version      |
