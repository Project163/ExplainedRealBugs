What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$query = MssqlModel::find()->select('id model_id')->indexBy('model_id');\r\nforeach ($query->batch() /*or each()*/) {\r\n// some code...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nIterate all MssqlModel objects.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n> \"There are no more rows in the active result set\" exception\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nFollowing\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/17433\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/17438\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/17489\r\n\r\nIn the BatchQueryResult getDriverName method as the following line:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif (isset($this->_batch[0]->db->driverName)) {\r\n     return $this->_batch[0]->db->driverName;\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's to get the driverName from the first index of the _batch recordSet. \r\n\r\nBut in case of using `indexBy()` in the Query, the _batch will (may) not have the index 0 and each index are array (I think it will be the same for associative array) and will lead to a `Trying to get property 'db' of non-object` Exception.   \r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.25 (since 2.0.24)\r\n| PHP version      |  7+\r\n| Operating system | Linux\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nUsing \\Yii::$app->db in batch() or each() call : \r\n \r\n```php\r\n$query = MssqlModel::find()->select('id model_id')->indexBy('model_id');\r\nforeach ($query->batch(100, \\Yii::$app->db) /*or each()*/) {\r\n// some code...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggest\r\n\r\nAs the BatchQueryResult class doc explain : \r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n     * @var Connection the DB connection to be used when performing batch query.\r\n     * If null, the \"db\" application component will be used.\r\n     */\r\n    public $db;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it's ***method*** explain : \r\n\r\n```php\r\n /**\r\n     * Starts a batch query.\r\n     * ...\r\n     * @param int $batchSize the number of records to be fetched in each batch.\r\n     * @param Connection $db the database connection. If not set, the \"db\" application component will be used.\r\n     * ...\r\n     */\r\n    public function batch($batchSize = 100, $db = null)\r\n```\r\nTry to use the \"db\" application component (but i'm not sure if $app is generic here) : \r\n\r\n```php \r\n/**\r\n     * Gets db driver name from the db connection that is passed to the `batch()`, if it is not passed it uses\r\n     * connection from the active record model\r\n     * @return string|null\r\n     */\r\n    private function getDbDriverName()\r\n    {\r\n        if (isset($this->db->driverName)) {\r\n            return $this->db->driverName;\r\n        }\r\n        if (isset($this->_batch[0]->db->driverName)) {\r\n            return $this->_batch[0]->db->driverName;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (isset(\\Yii::$app->db->driverName)) {\r\n            return \\Yii::$app->db->driverName;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17539/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
