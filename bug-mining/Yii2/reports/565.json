you have a multiple dropDownList like:\r\n\r\n`<?= $form->field($model, 'bla')->dropDownList(['test' => 'test', 'foo' => 'foo'], ['multiple' => 'multiple']) ?>`\r\n\r\nAnd the field is validated (it is for example required)\r\nIf you go to the view containing the form, and another field is validated (changed of blurred) then this field is also validated.\r\nThis is due the getValue function in yii.activeForm.js\r\nThis function gets the value for the field as array like [\"test\", \"foo\"] (when both selected)\r\nBut in the function \"validateAttribute\" also in yii.activeForm.js, the old value and new value are compared like:\r\n\r\n`if (this.value !== getValue($form, this)) {`\r\n\r\nThis will always match when arrays are compared in javascript, so the field will be always validated even when there are no changes.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
