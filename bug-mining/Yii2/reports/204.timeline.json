Which is not very good, and can confuse framework users. Developers will have non-standard behavior, and this is quite weird when documentation is for master, but 99% of people use stable (2.0.10 at the moment).\r\n\r\nthis is going to be fixed on the new website. There will be a switch to choose between 2.0.x 2.1.x and dev-master docs.\r\n\r\nWe also usually add something like \"This parameter is available since version 2.0.11\" so that problem is not that big. have been overseen in this case. will add
