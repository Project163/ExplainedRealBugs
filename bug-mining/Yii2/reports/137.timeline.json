The prefilter will fail the script that has already been added to `loadedScripts`, even though it's still loading. So `next` will run, and it will execute the inline script.\n\n> Why the new JS could be requested again? \n\nYou click a pjax link, which loads a page that contains activeform. yii.activeform.js is requested, it runs through ajaxPrefilter, and is added to loadedScripts immediately. Before it finishes loading however, you click another link that loads a different page that contains activeform (or even the same link), which again requests yii.activeform.js. Since yii.activeform.js is in loadedScripts, the request for it will immediately be aborted, triggering the evaluation of the next script. If yii.activeform.js has not loaded yet, the inline script will fail.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/163213265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nkovacs","id":2269242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjkyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2269242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs","html_url":"https://github.com/nkovacs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/163218693","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10358#issuecomment-163218693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10358","id":163218693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzIxODY5Mw==","user":{"login":"nkovacs","id":2269242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjkyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2269242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs","html_url":"https://github.com/nkovacs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkovacs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-09T12:48:35Z","updated_at":"2015-12-09T12:55:27Z","body":"The solution would be to store promises in `loadedScripts`, resolve them when the first xhr finishes, and only abort the subsequent xhrs when the promises are resolved.
