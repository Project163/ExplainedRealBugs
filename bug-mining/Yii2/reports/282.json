issue for https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/3305#issuecomment-296772327)\r\n\r\n`yii\\db\\Schema::refreshTableSchema()` is called after most schema-altering methods in `yii\\db\\Command` are called, but not the following ones:\r\n\r\n- `createTable()`\r\n- `addForeignKey()`\r\n- `dropForeignKey()`\r\n- `addCommentOnColumn()`\r\n- `dropCommentFromColumn()`\r\n\r\nEach of these do have an effect on what gets memoized by `getTableSchema()`, so they should be clearing the schema cache.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. call `yii\\db\\Schema::getTableSchema()` for a table that doesn’t exist\r\n2. create the the table\r\n3. call `yii\\db\\Schema::getTableSchema()` again for the same table name \r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\na `yii\\db\\TableSchema` object is returned\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n`null` is returned, because it was cached as `null` in step 1, and that cache was not cleared in step 2.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nSimilar steps to reproduce for the other functions listed above.\r\n\r\nPR is forthcoming…\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      |
