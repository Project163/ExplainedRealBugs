Eg.\r\n```\r\nclass FooFixture extends \\yii\\test\\ActiveFixture\r\n{\r\n    public $modelClass = 'app\\models\\Foo';\r\n    public $depends = [\r\n        '\\app\\tests\\fixtures\\BarFixture',\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nclass BarFixture extends \\yii\\test\\ActiveFixture\r\n{\r\n    public $modelClass = 'app\\models\\Bar';\r\n    public $depends = [\r\n        '\\app\\tests\\fixtures\\FooFixture',\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut this gives the error:\r\n```\r\n[yii\\base\\InvalidConfigException] A circular dependency is detected for fixture 'app\\tests\\fixtures\\FooFixture'.  \r\n                                                                                                                     \r\n#1  .../vendor/yiisoft/yii2/test/FixtureTrait.php:214\r\n#2  .../vendor/yiisoft/yii2/test/FixtureTrait.php:145\r\n#3  .../vendor/yiisoft/yii2/test/FixtureTrait.php:112\r\n#4  .../vendor/symfony/event-dispatcher/EventDispatcher.php:230\r\n#5  .../vendor/symfony/event-dispatcher/EventDispatcher.php:59`\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, I can remove one of the dependencies to break to loop and/or create a third fixture that depends on both FooFixture and BarFixture. But this quickly gets unwieldy when there are multiple such cases. It's already detecting if there is a circular dependency, so couldn't it simply check if a fixture has already been loaded and if so skip it?  Why is an exception needed?\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version  | 2.0.36\r\n| PHP version | 7.4.3\r\n| Operating system |Ubuntu 20.04\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
