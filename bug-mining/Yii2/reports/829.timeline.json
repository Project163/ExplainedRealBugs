### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n> \r\n> Use FileValidator with `extensions`.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> class UploadForm extends Model\r\n> {\r\n>     public function rules()\r\n>     {\r\n>         return [\r\n>             ['user_file', 'file', 'extensions' => \"jpg,jpeg,png.gif\"],\r\n>         ];\r\n>     }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ### What is the expected result?\r\n> \r\n> Validate extensions and MIME type correctly.\r\n> ### What do you get instead?\r\n> \r\n> Any upload files are not accepted. To avoid this, I set `checkExtensionByMimeType` to false:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>  ['user_file', 'file', 'extensions' => \"jpg,jpeg,png.gif\", 'checkExtensionByMimeType' => false],\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This problem occurs with only Yii 2.0.45 and PHP 8.1.\r\n> ### Additional info\r\n> Q \tA\r\n> Yii version \t2.0.45\r\n> PHP version \t8.1\r\n> Operating system \tDocker official PHP\r\n> \r\n> FileValidator uses `FileHelper::getMimeType` :\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     protected function validateExtension($file)\r\n>     {\r\n>         $extension = mb_strtolower($file->extension, 'UTF-8');\r\n> \r\n>         if ($this->checkExtensionByMimeType) {\r\n>             $mimeType = FileHelper::getMimeType($file->tempName, null, false);     // <------ here\r\n>             if ($mimeType === null) {\r\n>                 return false;\r\n>             }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This method was changed not to use real `finfo_open` (instead file name based detection) for PHP 8.1:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>         if (PHP_VERSION_ID >= 80100) {\r\n>             return static::getMimeTypeByExtension($file, $magicFile);\r\n>         }\r\n> \r\n>         $info = finfo_open(FILEINFO_MIME_TYPE, $magicFile);\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> But actually, uploaded file temp name has no extension like as `/tmp/php12AB45`.\r\n> \r\n> I suggest a choice:\r\n> \r\n>     * Ignore checkExtensionByMimeType when PHP 8.1.\r\n> \r\n>     * Save getMimeType method compatibility.\r\n\r\nI see there is a `.` in your validation rule; if it is not a mistake, then you can try using a backslash `\\` before the

What happened?\n\n### Description\r\nI'm using a custom controller to receive file uploads. Those uploads are validated via a YII file extension validator. Since upgrading to PHP 8.1 the model validation failed to work and resulted in an error regarding the file extension being forbidden.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that when I add the following option 'checkExtensionByMimeType' => false, the validation works again.\r\nThis seems to be a known problem with YII. See: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19243\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Define a File Model using the following code:\r\n\r\nclass UploadForm extends Model\r\n{\r\n    public ?UploadedFile $file;\r\n\r\n    public function rules(): array\r\n    {\r\n        return [\r\n          [['file'], 'file', 'skipOnEmpty' => false, 'extensions' => 'png,jpg,jpeg,svg,pdf,doc,ppt'],\r\n        ];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n2. Validate a model containing (for example) a file named \"image.png\"\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe validation should work when uploading a file with a valid extension. \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe validation fails with PHP 8.1\r\n\n\n### Craft CMS version\n\n3.8.13\n\n### PHP version\n\n8.1\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nlinux\n\n### Database type and version\n\nmariadb\n\n### Image driver and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installed plugins and versions\n\n-\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/craftcms/cms/issues/13411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/craftcms/cms/issues/13411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"schmunk42","id":649031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTAzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/649031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42","html_url":"https://github.com/schmunk42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmunk42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-21T09:03:38Z","updated_at":"2023-08-21T09:03:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19925","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19925/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19925/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19925/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19925","id":1849779297,"node_id":"I_kwDOADRbGc5uQWRh","number":19925,"title":"FileValidatorTest
