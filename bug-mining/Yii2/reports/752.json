Previously they would fail silently.\r\n\r\nThe change was made in this commit: https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/990bb34891c83d12c5129fd781893704f948f2f4\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. Connect to a MySQL database\r\n2. Call `Yii::$app->db->beginTransaction()`\r\n3. Make a schema change, such as add a new column to a table (the transaction will be autocommitted in the process)\r\n4. Call `Yii::$app->db->commit()`\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nPHP would move along to the next line of code, regardless of whether the app is running on PHP 5, 7, or 8.\r\n\r\n_(Note: it could be argued that an exception should in fact be thrown here in Yii 3, but I think it’s best to avoid a BC break in Yii 2.)_\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nA PDOException is thrown with the message `There is no active transaction` when running PHP 8.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.39.3\r\n| PHP version      | 8.0.0RC3\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18406/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
