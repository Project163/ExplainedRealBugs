have a two questions related to the `queryInternal` method in `\\yii\\db\\Command`.\r\n1) Is there any reason for `logQuery` to be `private`? This is the only private method in the whole class. We need to redefine it for some testing purposes and in this case we must copy whole `queryInternal` method just to be able to override `logQuery`.\r\n2) Can the cache key generation be extracted to a separate protected method from the `queryInternal`? We have some key in the persistent cache that is changed when any migrations is applied. We need to copy whole `queryInternal` method once again to be able to add that key to the cache key generation.","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
