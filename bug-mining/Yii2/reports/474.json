What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nRun the Yii2 requirement checker without the [PHP sockets](http://php.net/manual/en/book.sockets.php) extension.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nThe Yii requirement checker should not issue a warning about missing IPv6 support.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nA warning about potentially missing IPv6 support.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nIt checks if the `AF_INET6` constant is defined. This probably comes from this comment: http://php.net/manual/en/function.inet-pton.php#104917\r\n\r\nBut this is wrong: `AF_INET6` [is part](http://php.net/manual/en/sockets.constants.php) of the mentioned socket extension. But this extension is not required for IPv6 validation (also see #13976).\r\n\r\nI think, the requirement checker should instead just call `inet_pton()` with a predefined value and compare the result to the expected output.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.15.1\r\n| PHP version      |  7.1.16\r\n| Operating system | Alpine Linux 3.7\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16035/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
