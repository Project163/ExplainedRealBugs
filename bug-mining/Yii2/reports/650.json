What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. use `yii\\web\\MultipartFormDataParser` as a request parser\r\n2. upload file using PATCH method\r\n3. use UploadedFile to instanciate the file\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nWhen using UploadedFile::saveAs() file is saved into specified directory.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nSince it uses php-s `move_uploaded_file()` or `is_uploaded_file()` which check if php itself dealt with uploaded file (which it didn't), file is not saved.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n`yii\\web\\MultipartFormDataParser` deals with $_FILES itself not php.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.15.1\r\n\r\nRelates to #6996 but is not the same.","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17037/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17037/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
