What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n        $array1 = [\r\n            1,\r\n            null,\r\n            3,\r\n            null\r\n        ];\r\n\r\n        $array2 = [\r\n            'a',\r\n            'b'\r\n        ];\r\n\r\n        $array3 = [\r\n            null,\r\n            null,\r\n            'c',\r\n            'd'\r\n        ];\r\n\r\n        print_r(ArrayHelper::merge($array1, $array2, $array3));\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nThis is a result produces from array_merge() PHP native function\r\n>Array\r\n>(\r\n>    [0] => 1\r\n>    [1] => \r\n>    [2] => 3\r\n>    [3] => \r\n>    [4] => a\r\n>    [5] => b\r\n>    [6] => \r\n>    [7] => \r\n>    [8] => c\r\n>    [9] => d\r\n>)\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nThe function replaces `NULL` with with value from latter array. So `$array1[1]` gets replaced by `$array2[1]`.\r\n>Array\r\n>(\r\n>    [0] => 1\r\n>    [1] => b\r\n>    [2] => 3\r\n>    [3] => d\r\n>    [4] => a\r\n>    [5] => \r\n>    [6] => \r\n>    [7] => c\r\n>)\r\n\r\n### Possible cause ###\r\nIn `BaseArrayHelper::merge()`, on line 128 - 134.\r\n\r\n                } elseif (is_int($k)) {\r\n                    if (isset($res[$k])) {\r\n                        $res[] = $v;\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        $res[$k] = $v;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\n`isset()` will return `FALSE` on `NULL`. So if the former array has a `NULL` value, it will replace it with the value from the latter array.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the description of the function\r\n> For integer-keyed elements, the elements from the latter array will be appended to the former array\r\n\r\nSo these means the integer-keyed elements will always get appending. Unless it is not yet defined.\r\n\r\nThe code can be changed code into something like:\r\n\r\n                } elseif (is_int($k)) {\r\n                    if (array_key_exists($k, $res)) {\r\n                        $res[] = $v;\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        $res[$k] = $v;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\nI'm not fully testing it yet, so I'm not sure about the side effect of this code. However, is it actually alright to be like this?\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.11-dev (commit 7fcf75f to be exact)\r\n| PHP version      | 5.6.30\r\n| Operating system |Windows 10\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
