However per [rfc7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-4.1)\r\n> A 304 response cannot contain a message-body; it is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.\r\n\r\nThis would be a problem for `204 No Content` responses as well however `\\yii\\web\\Response::prepare()` explicitly sets the content of the response to `''` when the status is 204. It seems the same ought to be done for 304s as well. If this change is welcome I'd be happy to open a PR.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Configure your response formatter to support json\r\n```php\r\nYii::$app->response->formatters[\\yii\\web\\Response::FORMAT_JSON] = \\yii\\web\\JsonResponseFormatter::class;\r\n```\r\n2. Configure your controller to implement `yii\\filters\\HttpCache`\r\n```php\r\npublic function behaviors()\r\n{\r\n    $behaviors = parent::behaviors();\r\n\r\n    $behaviors[] = [\r\n        'class' => 'yii\\filters\\HttpCache',\r\n        'only' => ['view'],\r\n        'etagSeed' => function ($action, $params) {\r\n            return 'static-etag';\r\n        },\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    return $behaviors;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Make a request using the etag\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -v --location --request GET 'http://localhost/example/1' --header 'If-None-Match: \"ywR/RvOEhT8oO8ayzGOORj2GzbM\"' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'Content-Type: application/json'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nThe expected result is a response that with a 304 status and no response body.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nA response which includes the response body `null`. This is indicated by curl error message:\r\n```\r\n* Excess found in a non pipelined read: excess = 4 url = /example/1 (zero-length body)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.16\r\n| PHP version      | 7.1.17\r\n| Operating system | alpine3.4\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
