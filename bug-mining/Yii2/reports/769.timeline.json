The B brach contains every changes made in branch A.\r\nIf I create a PR v from branch B, part of it will be redundant with the first PR, wont it?\r\n\r\nAnother strange thing to me - if I look here on my original PR https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/18513/commits , the new commit with the docs draft is part od the original PR. I suppose it's because the PR is updated based on my A branch. Isn't that a better way? Because the docs aren't new issue, it's part of the original one.\r\n\r\nSo what should I do now? PR from my branch B https://github.com/OndrejVasicek/yii2/tree/18499-docs-draft ?\r\nOr is that updated PR enough?\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry occupying your time witch such basic stuff.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/779394292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OndrejVasicek","id":3864012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3864012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek","html_url":"https://github.com/OndrejVasicek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/779395703","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18499#issuecomment-779395703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18499","id":779395703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTM5NTcwMw==","user":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-15T18:46:27Z","updated_at":"2021-02-15T18:46:27Z","body":"The PR is a branch.
