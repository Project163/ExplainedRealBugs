What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nCreate database handle by using de dblib driver, using the following parameters:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    'class'               => 'yii\\db\\Connection',\r\n    'dsn'                 => 'dblib:version=7.2;host=myHost;dbname=myDB',\r\n    'username'            => 'myUsername',\r\n    'password'            => 'myPassw0rd',\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nexcute the following code:\r\n```\r\n$transaction = Yii::$app->db->beginTransaction();;\r\nvar_dump(Yii::$app->db->pdo->inTransaction());\r\n$transaction->rollback();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n`true`\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n`false`\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.40\r\n| PHP version      | 7.4\r\n| Operating system | CentOS\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/commit/cafe8e315cc9410e1116141b8256e22b1d1834dc broke transactions completely for database connections using the dblib driver.\r\nThere is a check for an active transaction now:https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/0781b02cc355b171e2eb544bc7897bc458ec56d8/framework/db/Transaction.php#L168\r\nBut since `inTransaction` returns false for dblib connections, no commit will be done, resulting in an automated rollback.\r\n\r\nThe reason for `inTransaction` to return false is that the transaction is not started with `beginTransaction` but with the SQL command 'START TRANSACTION` (see https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.intransaction.php#125087)\r\n\r\nI've tested this by commenting out the `beginTransaction` method in de mssql pdo component: \r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/0781b02cc355b171e2eb544bc7897bc458ec56d8/framework/db/mssql/PDO.php#L34\r\nWith this method commented out (thus using the native pdo beginTransaction), `inTransaction` correctly returns true now.\r\nThe comment at this method states \"_It is necessary to override PDO's method as MSSQL PDO driver does not natively support transactions._\" \r\nI wonder if this is still true, because the native pdo beginTransaction just seems to work fine.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18480/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
