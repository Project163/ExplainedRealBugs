What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Create GridView with checkbox column and some other column with _order_ (sorting) ability, and have at least one record row in it.\r\n2. Add some event handler on `:checkbox`, eg.:\r\n```js\r\n$(document).on('change', ':checkbox', function(){console.log('Test')});\r\n```\r\n3. Click on `check all` top checkbox in grid. `change` event is emitted for every single checkbox changed by clicking that `check all` one. This can be told by the number of `Test` in console being number of rows + 1 (for `check all` change itself).\r\n4. Reorder (sort) the grid using the other column.\r\n5. Click again on `check all` top checkbox in grid.\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n`change` event is emitted for every single checkbox in grid, just like it was before ordering/filtering\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n`change` event is emitted only for `check all` checkbox, but not any checkbox it changes on click\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.27\r\n| PHP version      | 7.2.22\r\n| Operating system | Windows 10 Pro x64\r\n| Browser | Firefox x64 69.0.2\r\n\r\nThis is related to #17332 - some JS binding probably gets lost on GridView rebuild after ordering/filtering. It **is** working correctly in Yii1 - we are migrating app from Yii1 to Yii2 so have a comparison in that matter.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
