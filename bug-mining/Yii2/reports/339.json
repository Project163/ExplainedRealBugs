These SQL statements contain some large base64 encoded data blobs. When I run `yii migrate --interactive=0`, every `insert` is printed to `stdout` in full.\r\n\r\nI would like an option to make all the individual SQL operations (those written in white between \r\neach migration file) to be hidden, so I'm only left with messages about each migration file being run. Could this be added to the framework?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13040 this is a similar issue, but I more specifically care about only reducing the amount of output rather than getting rid of all of it (I could do `>/dev/null` for that if I wanted to).\r\n\r\nThanks ","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13853/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
