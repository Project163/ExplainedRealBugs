there, so for me YiiActiveForm is not performing validation on field when is set manually so i need your help to check if its my problem or Yii.\r\nFrom the [Yii cookbook](https://github.com/samdark/yii2-cookbook/blob/master/book/forms-activeform-js.md#trigger-validation-for-the-whole-form) if we want to perform validation on form we just need to call \r\n```javascript\r\n$('#contact-form').yiiActiveForm('validate', true);\r\n```\r\nwe assume that it should validate the whole form and send the event afterValidate because the form was validated. But that doesn't happen and its because of this lines in [yii.activeForm.js](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/assets/yii.activeForm.js#L619-L627)\r\nthat clearly say that the event afterValidate can only be launched if we are trying to submit the form which we don't because we only want the validation itself.\r\nCurrently i have a workaround by playing with the events that looks like this\r\n```javascript\r\nvar validationHandler = function () {\r\n     var form = $('#criar-tarefa-form');\r\n     var data = form.data('yiiActiveForm');\r\n     data.submitting = true;\r\n     data.shouldSubmit = false;\r\n     form.on('afterValidate', handler);\r\n     form.on('beforeSubmit', function () {\r\n               var data = $('#criar-tarefa-form').data('yiiActiveForm');\r\n               if (!data.shouldSubmit) {\r\n                     data.shouldSubmit = true;\r\n                     return false;\r\n               }\r\n     });\r\n     $form.yiiActiveForm('validate', false);\r\n};\r\n```\r\nbut its dirty and unnecessary if the event could be fired after the validation ends.\r\nTo solve that problem it could be as simple as\r\n```javascript\r\n var updateInputs = function ($form, messages, submitting) {\r\n        var data = $form.data('yiiActiveForm');\r\n\r\n        if (data === undefined) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        var errorAttributes = [];\r\n            $.each(data.attributes, function () {\r\n                if (!$(this.input).is(\":disabled\") && !this.cancelled && updateInput($form, this, messages)) {\r\n                    errorAttributes.push(this);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            $form.trigger(events.afterValidate, [messages, errorAttributes]);\r\n\r\n        if (submitting) {\r\n            updateSummary($form, messages);\r\n\r\n            if (errorAttributes.length) {\r\n                if (data.settings.scrollToError) {\r\n                    var top = $form.find($.map(errorAttributes, function(attribute) {\r\n                        return attribute.input;\r\n                    }).join(',')).first().closest(':visible').offset().top - data.settings.scrollToErrorOffset;\r\n                    if (top < 0) {\r\n                        top = 0;\r\n                    } else if (top > $(document).height()) {\r\n                        top = $(document).height();\r\n                    }\r\n                    var wtop = $(window).scrollTop();\r\n                    if (top < wtop || top > wtop + $(window).height()) {\r\n                        $(window).scrollTop(top);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                data.submitting = false;\r\n            } else {\r\n                data.validated = true;\r\n                if (data.submitObject) {\r\n                    applyButtonOptions($form, data.submitObject);\r\n                }\r\n                $form.submit();\r\n                if (data.submitObject) {\r\n                    restoreButtonOptions($form);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            $.each(data.attributes, function () {\r\n                if (!this.cancelled && (this.status === 2 || this.status === 3)) {\r\n                    updateInput($form, this, messages);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n        submitFinalize($form);\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe just pass the errorAttributes setting and the form event before checking if we are submitting. because we want validation only.´\r\n\r\n### Yii Version 2.0.11.2\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
