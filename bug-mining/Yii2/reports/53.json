What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nInstall [Yii 2 Advanced Application Template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced), run built-in PHP server, go to [http://localhost:8080/backend/web/index.php?r=site%2Flogin](http://localhost:8080/backend/web/index.php?r=site%2Flogin) as unauthenticated user, execute in browser console `$.ajax('http://localhost:8080/backend/web/index.php');`. Note that visiting of page [http://localhost:8080/backend/web/index.php](http://localhost:8080/backend/web/index.php) requires authentication.\n### What is the expected result?\n\nRedirect to Login page.\n### What do you get instead?\n\n403 (Forbidden) is shown in browser console, no redirect.\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.8 |\n| PHP version | PHP 5.5.9-1ubuntu4.16 |\n| Operating system | Linux Ubuntu 14.04 |\n\nIn described situation Yii 2.0.7 does redirect to Login page, Yii 2.0.8 does not.
