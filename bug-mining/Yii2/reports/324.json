What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\ncreate a user with id=0, then call $auth->getPermissionsByUser(0), the result will be [];\r\nand all permission assigned to this user will not go into effect.\r\n\r\nIn yii\\rbac\\Dbmanger.php, line 526,\r\n if (empty($userId)) {  // here user.id=0 is traded as a empty. \r\n            return [];\r\n  }\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nuser with id=0 should be run as a normal user.\r\nor we should document the problem to remind the developer of YII2 to avoid using a user with id=0;\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nI set the user 0 as the admin of my system, and follows the yii2 Authorization programming Tutorial. but can not get the role admin works. So i trace the code and find this. \r\nNow, I directly edit my DB to avoid all the data associated with user 0. and set a new user with id>0 as the admin Role\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.12\r\n| PHP version   | 5.6.3\r\n| Operating system | WIN 10\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
