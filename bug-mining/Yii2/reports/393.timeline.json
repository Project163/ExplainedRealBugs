Yes, of course, if I do not need it, it does not mean everybody do not need it too. I just was wondering why I never met issue you mentioned.  \r\n\r\nI see the problem about REST apps with `echo` instead of `return`.\r\n\r\nBut.\r\n\r\nUsually PHP sends a warning when trying to send headers after they were sent:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Cannot add header information - headers already sent by...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt protects from hard-to-debug bugs when session does not start, cookies not sent etc. But in `yii\\web\\Response()` this warning was silently converted into nothing by:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if (headers_sent()) {\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout this check `PHP Warning` would informed you that something goes wrong (actually it would be converted to `Exception()` by Yii anyway). But it does not happen. Basically Yii was silently disabling one of PHP features. I am convinced exactly this was Yii2 bug, and not a feature. \r\n\r\n> My opinion - that's not such critical error to throw an exception.\r\n\r\n`HeadersAlreadySentException` can be replaced by `trigger_error('Headers already sent', E_USER_WARNING)` to mimic PHP default behavior. But as Yii will convert this to an `Exception()` anyway, so I do not think it makes sense..\r\n\r\nAny other ideas to solve this?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/356657782/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cronfy","id":762954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Mjk1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/762954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy","html_url":"https://github.com/cronfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cronfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1418048815,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQxODA0ODgxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/1418048815","actor":{"login":"irthunder","id":1427099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjcwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1427099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder","html_url":"https://github.com/irthunder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-10T16:33:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1418048819,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MTgwNDg4MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/1418048819","actor":{"login":"irthunder","id":1427099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjcwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1427099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder","html_url":"https://github.com/irthunder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irthunder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-10T16:33:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bscheshirwork","id":5769211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjkyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5769211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork","html_url":"https://github.com/bscheshirwork","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscheshirwork/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T13:23:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T13:23:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15682","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/

The only thing we risk with this PR is that `web/Response` events are not being triggered any more.\r\n\r\nThis will solve #19 \r\n\r\nIf you accept this PR, please bump `yii2-glide` version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trntv/yii2-glide/issues/21/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trntv/yii2-glide/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/376180653","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15046#issuecomment-376180653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15046","id":376180653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjE4MDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"Patricy","id":4677661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Nzc2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4677661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy","html_url":"https://github.com/Patricy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patricy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T14:14:30Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T14:14:30Z","body":"I has my own function which sends some headers (custom csv renderer for specific purposes).\r\nError was solved with adding \"exit\" after  renderer call\r\nBut seems is good idea to do not throw exception.
