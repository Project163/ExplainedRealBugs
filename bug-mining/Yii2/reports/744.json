Configure a `cache` component set to `yii\\caching\\FileCache`, with `keyPrefix` set to something:\r\n\r\n    ```php\r\n    'cache' => [\r\n        'class' => \\yii\\caching\\FileCache::class,\r\n        'keyPrefix' => 'foobar',\r\n        'cachePath' => '@runtime/cache',\r\n    ],\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Save a few things to the cache.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nThe cached items should be stored in `@runtime/cache/<dir>`, where `<dir>` is the first two characters of the cache key passed to `set()`.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nAll cached items are all stored in `@runtime/cache/fo`, where `fo` is the first two characters of the `keyPrefix`.\r\n\r\nThis could be solved by trimming off the `keyPrefix` when determining the path, as we are doing [here](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/9f040c64778ab4152e75c0fce2d317dcd7dab1f0#diff-7b81f493c030b7bde1941b2ee4f6b294R32-R38).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.36\r\n| PHP version      | 7.4.7\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18263/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
