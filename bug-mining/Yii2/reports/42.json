split gettng label and rendering cell in `yii\\grid\\DataColumn::renderHeaderCellContent()`.\nSo `renderHeaderCellContent` will be simplified and looks like:\n\n``` php\nprotected function renderHeaderCellContent()\n    {\n        if ($this->header !== null || $this->label === null && $this->attribute === null) {\n            return parent::renderHeaderCellContent();\n        }\n\n        $label = $this->getHeaderCellLabel();\n\n        if ($this->attribute !== null && $this->enableSorting &&\n            ($sort = $this->grid->dataProvider->getSort()) !== false && $sort->hasAttribute($this->attribute)) {\n            return $sort->link($this->attribute, array_merge($this->sortLinkOptions, ['label' => ($this->encodeLabel ? Html::encode($label) : $label)]));\n        } else {\n            return $this->encodeLabel ? Html::encode($label) : $label;\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nIt will be usefull when someone (like me:)) will extends DataColumn and change `renderHeaderCellContent` behavior.\n\nMethod `getHeaderCellLabel()` may be defined also in `yii\\grid\\Column` and looks like:\n\n``` php\n    protected function getHeaderCellLabel()\n    {\n        return $this->grid->emptyCell;\n    }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
