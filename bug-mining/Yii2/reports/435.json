What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nJoin a relation and override the default where condition from the relation.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nNavItem::find()\r\n->select(['cms_nav_item.title', 'timestamp_update', 'update_user_id', 'nav_id'])\r\n->joinWith(['updateUser' => function ($q) {\r\n    $q->select(['firstname', 'lastname', 'id'])->where([]);\r\n}, 'nav'])\r\n->where(['cms_nav.is_deleted' => false])\r\n->limit(10)\r\n->orderBy(['timestamp_update' => SORT_DESC])\r\n->asArray(true)\r\n->all();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe relation inside the model:\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function getUpdateUser()\r\n{\r\n    return $this->hasOne(User::class, ['id' => 'update_user_id']);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe find method from the User model:\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic static function find()\r\n{\r\n    return parent::find()->where(['is_deleted' => false]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the `$q->select(['firstname', 'lastname', 'id'])->where([]);` will override `where(['is_deleted' => false]);`.\r\n\r\nbtw: I'm sure there is also a better solution for this problem, but it was working in 2.0.13 so i thought it makes sense to report.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nReturns the array with results.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nIn the current dev-master the `$q->select(['firstname', 'lastname', 'id'])->where([]);` does not override the relation where condition anymore. this will raise an exception:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n\"SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064\r\nYou have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ')) AND (`id` IN ('1', '0'))' at line 1\r\nThe SQL being executed was: \r\nSELECT `firstname`, `lastname`, `id`\r\nFROM `admin_user`\r\nWHERE (()) AND (`id` IN ('1', '0'))\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n|
