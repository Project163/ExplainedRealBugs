use nginx, PHP 5.5.14, php-fpm, yii2, mac os.\n\nI changed yii config to store session in database (postgress, user is superuser).

I've got `<?= Html::csrfMetaTags() ?>` in head section and I have csrf input in my form. So it seems not the problem.\n2. I don't want to do public $enableCsrfValidation = false; because I think it's not solution but workaround.\n   How could I understand what cause this error? As I mentioned earlier problem only appears when I store session in database.\n\nI could set and get variable from session. For example, I put it in beoreAction of Controller.php\n\n```\nYii::$app->session->set('test', 'qwe');\n$t = Yii::$app->session->get('test') ;\nvar_dump($t);\n```\n\nBut after that If I comment first line like this\n\n```\n//Yii::$app->session->set('test', 'qwe');\n$t = Yii::$app->session->get('test') ;\nvar_dump($t);\n```\n\nand refresh the page - I recieve NULL (BTW I could see Cookie:PHPSESSID=cfg9sutufqchr1tdose4cack15 in cookies after refresh).\n\nSo it seems there are some problems with session (DbSession) or maybe my php/php-fpm/nginx settings.\n\nI've post some additional information on SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28965388/yii2-unable-to-verify-your-data-submission\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/7696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/7696/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
