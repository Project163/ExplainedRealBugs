a consequence of the fix for issue #7341, if an input is disabled by javascript on the client side after being validated and has an error, its error is not cleared during the second validation.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Create a form with three inputs, a checkbox and two text fields.\r\n2. Include javascript in checkbox onchange to disable the first text field.\r\n3. Set the first text field to required, and add conditional validation (server and client side) to ignore required if the checkbox is checked.\r\n4. Set the second text field to be required unconditionally.\r\n4. Submit the form with nothing in either text field. Notice error on first text field is displayed correctly.\r\n5. Check the checkbox, disabling the first text field.\r\n6. Submit the form again.  The error on the disabled field remains, even though it is no longer required.\r\n7. Add text to second text box.\r\n8. Submit for again.  Notice form posts successfully even though error is indicated on first text field.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nThe error on the disabled field should be cleared.  The field will not be submitted, therefore it should not have an error.  It does not actually inhibit form submission.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nError on the first text box while it is disabled.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.11.2\r\n| PHP version      | 7.0.17.2\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
