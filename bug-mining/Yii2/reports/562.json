In case you need support please use one of\r\nYii communities listed at https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/wiki/communities\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nIn a console controller, add an option that will render hyphenated, e.g. `numMessages`. Also add an alias for this option:\r\n```\r\npublic function optionAliases()\r\n{\r\n    return array_merge([\r\n        'n' => 'numMessages',\r\n    ], parent::optionAliases());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nWhen rendering the help for the command, I expect the option to be rendered as\r\n```\r\n--num-messages, -n: text to go with option\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n```\r\n--num-messages: text to go with option\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo  no option alias is rendered. It turns out that I need to specify the alias to the _rendered_ value of the option:\r\n```\r\npublic function optionAliases()\r\n{\r\n    return array_merge([\r\n        'n' => 'num-messages',\r\n    ], parent::optionAliases());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.16\r\n| PHP version      | 7.2.15-1+ubuntu18.04.1+deb.sury.org+1\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
