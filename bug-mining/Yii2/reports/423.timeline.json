The session table has less than 1000 rows, the garbage collector is working correctly. I guess prior to `2.0.13` the errors were not exposed through the standard error logger - now this is fixed by #14908 \r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure why would the generated session id collide so often. My solution does the check if session id already exists in the storage in a transaction. Performance impact should be negligible as there should be only one session read/write per
