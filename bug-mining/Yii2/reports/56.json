would be nice to have support for wildcards at `yii\\base\\ActionFilter` `only` and `except` properties.\n\nIt make a little sense in the scope of the controller, but if `ActionFilter` is attached to the module or application itself - the feature is exceptionally useful.\nIn case of `Module` (`Application`) the actions are processed with full id, e.g. 'site/index' or 'module/default/index' and operating them is not practical. However, wildcard usage allows to cover set of actions: \n\n``` php\nreturn [\n    'as filter' => [\n        'class' => 'app\\filters\\SomeFilter',\n        'only' => [\n            'particular/*', // all actions at controller 'particular'\n            '*/captcha', // all 'captcha' actions through all controllers\n        ],\n    ],\n    // ...\n];\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"klimov-paul","id":1482054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul","html_url":"https://github.com/klimov-paul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11591/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11591/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
