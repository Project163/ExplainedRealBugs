What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nTrying to format the following message:\n`{recipientCount,plural,=0{There are no recipients}=1{The only recipient is {recipientName}}=2{The two recipients are {recipientName}}other{Too many recipients to list, # in total}}`\nwhen using an integer value of 1 or 2 it always falls back to other.\n### What is the expected result?\n\nTo display the message \"The two recipients are {recipientName}\" when recipient count is 2.\n### What do you get instead?\n\nI got the message \"Too many recipients to list, # in total}\"\n### Explanation and possible solution:\n\nThe issue resides in how the plural fallback mechanism works in yii2/framework/i18n/MessageFormatter.php. Lines 404 and 407 use NULL as the length parameter in mb_substr, but this can cause issues with UTF-8 strings as the length sometimes cannot be determined.\n`$selector = trim(mb_substr($selector, $pos + 1, null, $charset));`\n\nI suggest the following fix:\n`$selector = trim(mb_substr($selector, $pos + 1, mb_strlen($selector, $charset), $charset));`\n\nUsing mb_strlen($selector, $charset) should correctly detect the length so the selector can return the correct value to match against. Otherwise it returns an empty string which does not match the current argument.\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.8 |\n| PHP version | 5.3.6 |\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 14 |\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
