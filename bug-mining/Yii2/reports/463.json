What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nI have a ActiveQuery class that override one() and all() methods to basically add a innerJoin and where clause at every search of that model and the model that joins has a same column name of primary key (at this case `id`). So i need to use findOne() method to get only one AR element searching by primary key or another column.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nRetrieves one element of AR after search.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nWhen i try to use `findOne([tableName.columnName => $id])` tells me that `tableName.columnName` is not a column name.\r\n`Key \"cota.id\" is not a column name and can not be used as a filter`\r\n\r\nWhen i try to use findOne($id) throws a IntegrityException with the message that `id`column is ambiguos at sql.\r\n``The SQL being executed was: SELECT `cota`.* FROM `cota` INNER JOIN `secretaria` ON secretaria.id = cota.fk_secretaria WHERE `id`='1'``\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.15\r\n| PHP version      | 7.0\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
