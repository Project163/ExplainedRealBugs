In case you need support please use one of\r\nYii communities listed at https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/wiki/communities\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nOverride class [Formatter](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/i18n/Formatter.php) and override [asShortSize](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/i18n/Formatter.php#L1378) method and try to call [formatNumber](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/i18n/Formatter.php#L1660) from your asShortSize method.\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n[formatNumber](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/i18n/Formatter.php#L1660) method to be protected or even public.\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n [formatNumber](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/i18n/Formatter.php#L1660) method is private and I can not call it in my overridden asShortSize method.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nI have extended Formatter class and overrided [asShortSize](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/i18n/Formatter.php#L1378) method.\r\nThe only thing I want change is **KiB**, **MiB** etc... into **K**, **M** etc... but [formatNumber](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/i18n/Formatter.php#L1660) method is private and I can not call it from my `asShortSize` method. I think making `formatNumber` method protected will not hurt anything.
