Create a Unix-based VM on a Windows host box, using VirtualBox (e.g. with Vagrant or Docker).\r\n2. Share a Windows directory with the VM\r\n3. Install Yii in that shared directory\r\n4. Write a script that creates a lock with the FileMutex class and (attempts to) releases it.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nThe lock should be released.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nThe lock doesn’t get released, because PHP thinks it is running in a Unix environment, and so the Unix fork of logic here is run, when the Windows fork should have run:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/001e4c5aed5c8e3ab93fe530bc96e80d83852208/framework/mutex/FileMutex.php#L152-L164\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.15.1\r\n| PHP version      | 7.2\r\n| Operating system | Unix via Windows host\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
