In case you need support please use one of\r\nYii communities listed at https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/wiki/communities\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. Create an invokable class:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass Foo\r\n{\r\n    public function __invoke()\r\n    {\r\n        return new \\stdClass();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Call `Yii::createObject`:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$stdClassInstance = \\Yii::createObject(new Foo());\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.  An error shows: `ReflectionFunction::__construct() expects parameter 1 to be string, object given`.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\n`$stdClassInstance` is an instance of `stdClass`.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nYii use `is_callable` to check if a param is a `callable` or not, but in `yii\\di\\Container::resolveCallableDependencies` function, simply use `is_array` to check the `callable` is a method or function.\r\n\r\nIn PHP Documentation, a [callable](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.callable.php) was defined as 6 types.\r\n\r\nSo, if there was an object which has `__invoke` method, that will be a `callable` in PHP, but it's not an array.\r\n\r\nIt should be easy to fix. In my environment, I just add 2 lines in `resolveCallableDependencies` (See commented lines):\r\n\r\n```php\r\n        if (is_array($callback)) {\r\n            $reflection = new \\ReflectionMethod($callback[0], $callback[1]);\r\n        // } elseif (is_object($callback)) {\r\n        //     $reflection = new \\ReflectionMethod($callback, '__invoke');\r\n        } else {\r\n            $reflection = new \\ReflectionFunction($callback);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's works for me.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | >=2.0.7\r\n| PHP version      | 7.0\r\n| Operating system | macOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16514/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
