I also pass the second one and skip into the try section.\r\nIn the catch part, the $deleteError has value 1, which I suppose is an error.\r\nAnd i think the last line is a bug. It returns true whenever the value is different than 0.\r\nSo my file isn't deleted and still the whole method returns true.\r\n\r\nIt should be like this\r\n`return $deleteError == 0;`\r\n\r\nOr my understanding of $deleteError is wrong, but then again - why it returns true when no file was deleted?\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.?\r\n| PHP version      | 7.1.4\r\n| Operating system | Win10\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
