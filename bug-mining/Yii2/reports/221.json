But in this configuration order the behavior can't do his job because the items aren't set yet.\n\nSo, to be sure all configuration values are set I would like to have a Widget::EVENT_INIT.\n","closed_by":{"login":"klimov-paul","id":1482054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul","html_url":"https://github.com/klimov-paul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12000/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
