(client side validation still works as expected and will prevent reproduction of the issue)\r\n- Post the form without selecting any file.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nA validation error 'Please upload a file'.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nThe validation passes.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nThe regression is introduced by the changes to `validateAttribute()` in https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/20167 which were released with Yii 2.0.50. It still works as expected on 2.0.49.\r\n\r\n@bizley Since skipOnEmpty is set to false, validateOnAttribute() is called and should still handle the case where no file has been uploaded. The validation should be executed even if `$minFiles` is still set to the default of 0. Previously, this happened here, but this code is not reached anymore in the given scenario: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/7c5b21355724659ac4ed39099a73ef30eeb4455c/framework/validators/FileValidator.php#L258\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.50\r\n| PHP version      | -\r\n| Operating system | -\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
