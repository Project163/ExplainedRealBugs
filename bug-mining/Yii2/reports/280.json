What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Create a view with masked input using following configuration:\r\n```php\r\n$input->widget(\\yii\\widgets\\MaskedInput::className(), [\r\n                'clientOptions' => [\r\n                    'alias' => 'currency',\r\n                    'prefix' => false,\r\n                ],\r\n            ])\r\n```\r\n2. Load page and look at javascript console.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nInput with inputmask works as expected.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nInputmask does not work correctly, throws an error at JavaScript console:\r\n`Uncaught TypeError: str.replace is not a function`\r\n\r\nDue to this all other Javascript-dependent functions stop working (other plugins, widgets etc.).\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nI managed to establish that:\r\n\r\n- bug does not happen on Yii 2.0.10, because of jquery.inputmask plugin version 3.2.7 is used\r\n- bug is related to #11906 \r\n\r\nThere is no timeline when this will be fixed in jquery.inputmask plugin. However, Yii's composer.json states that older version of jquery.inputmask can be installed\r\n```json\r\n\"bower-asset/jquery.inputmask\": \"~3.2.2 | ~3.3.3\"\r\n```\r\nso user can force installing older version by adding\r\n```json\r\n\"bower-asset/jquery.inputmask\": \"~3.2.2\"\r\n```\r\nto the composer.json in app's main directory. It should be noted in upgrades section.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.11.2\r\n| PHP version      | 5.6.30\r\n| Operating system | Windows (browser), Linux (server)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
