In case you need support please use one of\r\nYii communities listed at https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/wiki/communities\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nI would like to configurate the `db` component for the [ActiveDataProvider](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/data/ActiveDataProvider.php#L91). \r\nThe following is stated in the PHPDoc\r\n\r\n```PHP\r\n    /**\r\n     * @var Connection|array|string the DB connection object or the application component ID of the DB connection.\r\n     * If not set, the default DB connection will be used.\r\n     * Starting from version 2.0.2, this can also be a configuration array for creating the object.\r\n     */\r\n    public $db;\r\n```\r\nSo I assume the following\r\n\r\n```PHP\r\npublic $db; // -> default Connection is used\r\npublic $db = 'db' // Yii::$app->get('db') is used\r\npublic $db = ['__class' => SomeClass] // SomeClass is used\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nI except to get an Object with `$this->db`\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nBut actually because of the following lines\r\n\r\n```PHP\r\nif (is_string($this->db)) {\r\n    $this->db = Instance::ensure($this->db, Connection::className());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOnly the string config works. So please either change the PHPDoc to avoid confusion or remove the `is_string` check. Of course this is basically trivial to fix I just think it was worth mentioning.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.36\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
