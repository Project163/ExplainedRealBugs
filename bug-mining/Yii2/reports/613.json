is refusing dash character (`-`) in action ids, but it is accepting backslashes (`\\`) on the other hand.\r\n\r\nI think this is due to a possible mistake in the pattern to validate an id in method `Controller::createAction()`, line 228, as follows:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/efe8d48f156e9e76994a2322cdd0fb4d68bd8f6a/framework/base/Controller.php#L227-L229\r\n\r\nThe double backslashes in the pattern are matching characters in the range from `\\` (93) to `_` (95), which includes `\\`, `]`, `^` and `_` instead of only `-` and `_`, which I suppose was the initial intention. \r\n\r\nCan someone please confirm me if that is a bug or am I lacking any information?","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17507/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
