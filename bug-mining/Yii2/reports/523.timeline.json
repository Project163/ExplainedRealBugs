The problem isn't the realisation, the problem is figuring out what's happening there and if I'm actually telling the truth.\r\nBecause I can’t fully understand the line \r\n`exec('DEL /F/Q ' . escapeshellarg($path), $lines, $deleteError);`\r\nWell I know in general, but I only assume it should return 0 in `$deleteError` if there is no error. That’s why I suggested the last line to be return `$deleteError == 0;`\r\nBut really, someone with better understanding of this has to made the final decision.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/385244604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OndrejVasicek","id":3864012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3864012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek","html_url":"https://github.com/OndrejVasicek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndrejVasicek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1600489739,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTYwMDQ4OTczOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/1600489739","actor":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-29T11:33:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1600489740,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2MDA0ODk3NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/1600489740","actor":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-29T11:33:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/385247235","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16183#issuecomment-385247235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16183","id":385247235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTI0NzIzNQ==","user":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","s
