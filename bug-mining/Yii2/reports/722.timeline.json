Description\r\n\r\nRunning into some odd behavior with inline validators, I think its related the to the changes in Yii 2.0.36.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.yiiframework.com/news/293/yii-2-0-36\r\n\r\nFirst noticed that a couple of my custom inline validators were throwing an `UnknownMethodException` when referencing the current class via `$this` from within the validator. Move the validator out into it's own public function and all good.\r\n\r\nIt looks like commerce is also running into the same issue when using an inline validator within the Variant

`UnknownMethodException` within the cp for me:\r\n\r\n> Calling unknown method: craft\\commerce\\models\\LineItem::hasStock()\r\n\r\nNot sure if / where Craft might run into this too and if this is still possible with the new version of Yii (or if it is a Yii bug), but figured best to post here as a possible issue with 3.5, before reporting to commerce. \r\n\r\n### Additional
