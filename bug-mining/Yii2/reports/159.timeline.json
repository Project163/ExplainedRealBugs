know this might be a bit strange to ask, but I would like if it is possible to change private scope of `createModels` in `ActiveQueryTrait`. \n\nGenerally my opinion is that one should never use private scope inside frameworks since you never know which part of the framework somebody might use and modify by extending that class and overriding that function. It would be best to use only protected and public.\n\nHere is a reason why I would find this change to be really good:\nWe wanted to make a functionality which extends ActiveRecord query and allows you to do things like:\n\n``` php\nActiveRecord::find()->configure([\n   'scenario' => 'some-scenario',\n   'attribute1' => '...'\n   // ...\n])->andWhere()->orWhere()->all();\n```\n\nWhich would basically return all models already set with attributes and scenarios of my choosing. You could argue that I could do this in `afterFind` of a specific model but this leaves way more customization ability because sometimes I want to avoid doing things (like loading additional data) in `afterFind` when a specific scenario is set and there is no way to do this in current Yii 2. If I could extend `createModels` function. Here is how it would look like in extended ActiveQuery:\n\n``` php\nclass ActiveQueryExtension extends yii\\db\\ActiveQuery {\n    public $modelConfig = [];\n\n    public function configure($data)\n    {\n        $this->_modelConfig = $data;\n        return $this;\n    }\n\n    protected function createModels($rows) \n    {\n        $models = parent::createModels($rows);\n\n        foreach($models as $model) {\n              \\Yii::configure($model, $this->modelConfig);\n        }   \n\n        return $models;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOther problems we found is with `UploadedFile`, specifically `private static $_files;`. We wanted to use validation functionality and processing of files (loaded through server from remote location) through models while relying on original `UploadedFile` (by extending it) and we basically needed to extend almost all of the methods in `UploadedFile` just because of `private static $_files;`. line, while otherwise we would override 2 or 3 methods to what we need.\n\nNow I know that this might be a minor issue and also some people might find issues with not using private, but it would help great to people which want to extend by overriding.

you can, but overriding `createModels()` allows for cleaner code. \n\nIf you try to override `populate()` to get the effect of setting a scenario and/or other attributes before `afterFind()` is called we would have to do this:\n\n``` php\nclass ActiveQueryExtension extends yii\\db\\ActiveQuery {\n    public $modelConfig = [];\n\n    public function configure($data)\n    {\n        $this->_modelConfig = $data;\n        return $this;\n    }\n\n    public function populate($rows)\n    {\n        if (empty($rows)) {\n            return [];\n        }\n\n        $models = $this->createModels($rows);\n\n        foreach($models as $model) {\n            \\Yii::configure($model, $this->modelConfig);\n        }\n\n        if (!empty($this->join) && $this->indexBy === null) {\n            $models = $this->removeDuplicatedModels($models);\n        }\n        if (!empty($this->with)) {\n            $this->findWith($this->with, $models);\n        }\n        if (!$this->asArray) {\n            foreach ($models as $model) {\n                $model->afterFind();\n            }\n        }\n\n        return $models;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, I would have to override the whole `populate()` function which is:\n1.

Please tell me **which function** should I extend in `ActiveQuery` to attach that event so that it gets called when `parent::afterFind()` is executed?\n\nThe only way your solution would work is that I set a behavior to every model I need this to be done and set model configuration inside that behavior statically which:\n1. Is not configurable outside of the same model (unless you expect me to set configuration statically?)\n2. It would defeat the purpose of simple extension which would be done easily if just one function goes to protected.\n\nThe ONLY solution which I know which keeps all of this is that I make a hack by using `indexBy` and passing my own function in there which does the configuration and that is a horrible implementation

So I will leave this issue with these thoughts:\n1. Your workaround won't work correctly for use cases when the same model will be loaded inside `afterFind()`, as is in case of recursive parent-child loading since children will get the same configuration because of the global event. Or in any other use case when the same model will be loaded in `afterFind()`. So that is something to keep in mind when using this.\n2. Keeping methods private in an open source project is not a good idea in the long run IMHO. I understand your idea of making people do better implementation with what they have while making code more robust to future changes but as you see, you need a perfect foresight for this and an ability to see the future. Aside from that, there are currently some things in Yii that are impossible to do because of this, and the time I spend \"convincing\" that some change is needed is the time taken from doing actual work with Yii. Not to mention all of the other integration checks and tests needed to be passed until the next version/revision is released. Your time would be better spent on making this framework even better than trying to code around changes to allow maximum compatibility with other people code. You do not want to make another Wordpress I hope :)\n\nAnyways, thanks for clarification. I guess I have no other choice than to go with this workaround. Hope things will get different as Yii progresses. :) \n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/257519130/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ArekX","id":4344776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDQ3NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4344776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX","html_url":"https://github.com/ArekX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArekX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/257524248","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12015#issuecomment-257524248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12015","id":257524248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzUyNDI0OA==","user":{"login":"dynasource","id":125726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTcyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource","html_url":"https://github.com/dynasource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dynasource/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-01T09:36:18Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T09:36:18Z","body":"We are very pleased to see your effort to convince us of the necessity.
