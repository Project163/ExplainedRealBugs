That's why options of individual script / CSS aren't propagated and instead use either config of the asset bundle itself or asset manager config.\r\n\r\nThank you for contributing but won't merge the pull request:\r\n\r\n1. The behavior is correct one for some valid cases.\r\n2. It is configurable.\r\n3. It's covered by tests so changing it is a backwards compatibility break for the functionality developers may rely on.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @samdark in https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/18068#issuecomment-653251537_","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
