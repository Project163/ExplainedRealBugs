the InlineValidator is created in case of model-method-based inline validators. Instead of just passing a method's name now there is an array with an instance of Model in question and the method's name. This works thanks to the fact that `call_user_func` can take such array as first parameter so there should be no BC change.\r\n\r\nSince EachValidator creates a new instance of DynamicModel internally this change allows inline validators defined in the original model to be used.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked all possible drawbacks here. Definitely now method that is inline validator cannot have limited visibility but I haven't checked if it could be the case before this change.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look and see if this can be the solution to the issue. If so, I will add changelog.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18052/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-20T10:07:21Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T10:07:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18050","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18050/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18050/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18050/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18050","id":621015938,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MjEwMTU5Mzg=","number":18050,"title":"Need

This breaks the InlineValidators that'd use $this->$attribute in an inline anonymous function.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nHave a model with an array attribute.\r\nCreate a rule in your model with EachValidator, and as a rule set an inline function, causing an InlineValidator instance to be created. In this inline anonymous function, try checking if the members of the array are valid by accessing $this->$attribute.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n$this should be the actual object on which the function was called, $this->$attribute should be one member of the array in each call.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n$this is bound to the original Model class, and $this->$attribute is the array attribute.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.35\r\n| PHP version      | 7.4\r\n| Operating
