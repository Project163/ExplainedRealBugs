I'm authoring console controllers I want a consistent way to choose exit codes for errors. I don't want to have to \"think of a number\" every time I return a non-zero exit code. And I don't want to invent my own schema. So years ago I adopted the old [FreeBSD sysexits(3)](http://man.openbsd.org/sysexits) codes and definitions. This has worked well for me.\r\n\r\nA little while ago, I added something like a port of sysexits.h to my extension of the Yii2 ConsoleHelper. Now, instead of magic numbers like `return 64;`, I have `return ConsoleHelper::EX_USAGE;` and the IDE's autocomplete means I no longer have to refer to sysexits(3) man page to choose an exit code.\r\n\r\nI'm sending a PR in case you would like to incorporate this into Yii.","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
