What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nI think this has been brought up in #11306 already but it was not described clearly.\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n- MySQL or MariaDB cluster with multiple masters\r\n- or a single master with one or more slaves setup\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nThe connection may take too long to recover after a failure.\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior of Yii is to cache the status of unavailable master servers. In case all masters are unavailable this is cached too and no attept is made to try connecting.\r\n\r\nIt will take `serverRetryInterval` seconds (which is default to 10min) to get a connection back.\r\n\r\nDuring that time the exception message `None of the master DB servers is available.` is shown without any attempt to connect.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nWhen no master is available, Yii should ignore unavailable server cache and try to connect anyway, ideally updating the cache status marking a server as available again after successful connection.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.x\r\n| PHP version      | all\r\n| Operating system | all\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
