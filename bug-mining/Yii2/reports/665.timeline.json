configuration component for `UrlManager::$cache` (like in many other similar cases) so you could create custom cache instance just for `UrlManger` without a need to declare it as global component (see https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16721#issuecomment-422143911 and https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16721#issuecomment-422315982).\r\n\r\nTechnically this could be a BC break - previously misconfiguration (for example typo in component name) was silently ignored. Now it will throw an exception if configured cache component cannot be initialized.
