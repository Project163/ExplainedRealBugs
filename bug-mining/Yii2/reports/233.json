What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nWhen working with different sql schema the db dependency should be able to use the query builder to generate the sql statements.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nnew DbDependency(['sql' => 'SELECT MAX(id) FROM admin_storage_folder WHERE is_deleted=0']);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above example will work in mysql but not pgsql.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nOur CMS system provides auto of the box caching mechanism, but db depencies are direct sql statements. It should be possible to provide query build with the query builder in order to provide independent sql schemas.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/caching/DbDependency.php#L60\r\n\r\nIf there is another solution its not yet document in the guide nor api, let me know and will send a PR.  \r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.10\r\n| PHP version      | 7.x\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"klimov-paul","id":1482054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul","html_url":"https://github.com/klimov-paul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13278/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
