change to `Query:queryScalar` #11122 (and the refactoring #13144) changes the behaviour (which temporary unsets `limit `and `offset`) of  `Query::queryScalar` when `orderBy `is not empty. \r\n\r\nIf `limit` is set to a value lower then results count and `orderBy` is not empty the `Query::count()` returns limit instead of the expected count.\r\n\r\nShouldn't  `limit `and `offset` be unset in both blocks, like this?:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nprotected function queryScalar($selectExpression, $db)\r\n{\r\n    if ($this->emulateExecution) {\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    $limit = $this->limit;\r\n    $offset = $this->offset;\r\n    $this->limit = null;\r\n    $this->offset = null;\r\n\r\n    $result = null;\r\n    if (\r\n        !$this->distinct\r\n        && empty($this->groupBy)\r\n        && empty($this->having)\r\n        && empty($this->union)\r\n        && empty($this->orderBy)\r\n    ) {\r\n        $select = $this->select;\r\n\r\n        $this->select = [$selectExpression];\r\n\r\n        $command = $this->createCommand($db);\r\n\r\n        $this->select = $select;\r\n\r\n        $result = $command->queryScalar();\r\n    } else {\r\n        $result = (new Query)->select([$selectExpression])\r\n            ->from(['c' => $this])\r\n            ->createCommand($db)\r\n            ->queryScalar();\r\n    }\r\n    $this->limit = $limit;\r\n    $this->offset = $offset;\r\n    return $result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nMariaDB for example had no problems with `order by' and aggregate functions like count().\r\nSo we use the same query for pagination and count in our REST interface.\r\nA workaround on application site is to empty orderBy or limit before executing the count() query,\r\nbut this worked until 2.0.11 - so this is a breaking change IMHO.\r\n\r\n \r\nExample of \"wrong\" raw sql generated by  `Query::count()` :\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM `product` WHERE (`name` LIKE :qp0) AND (`class_id`=:qp1) ORDER BY `parent_id`, `sort` LIMIT 100) `c`\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13846/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
