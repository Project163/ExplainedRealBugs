notice a loop when enabling `queryCache` on a database that is also the storage for the `cache` component. This might be related to #5106.\n\nIt seems that the `DbCache` his `setValue` and `addValue` function just write the info to the default `db` component,  that in the end causes a loop since the query to save the cache value will also trigger a new insert for the `queryCache`.\n\nI've took a quick look in `DbCache` but there seems no way to block a new insertion in the DbCache from generating a new cache entry.\n\nThis patch encloses those updates in a `noCache()` call, and if I'm right, that should solve this. Am I correct? Did I miss anything?\n\n``` patch\ndiff --git a/framework/caching/DbCache.php b/framework/caching/DbCache.php\nindex 8c1fcbb..55819e1 100644\n--- a/framework/caching/DbCache.php\n+++ b/framework/caching/DbCache.php\n@@ -185,13 +185,16 @@ class DbCache extends Cache\n      */\n     protected function setValue($key, $value, $duration)\n     {\n-        $command = $this->db->createCommand()\n-            ->update($this->cacheTable, [\n-                'expire' => $duration > 0 ? $duration + time() : 0,\n-                'data' => [$value, \\PDO::PARAM_LOB],\n-            ], ['id' => $key]);\n+        $result = $this->db->noCache(function (Connection $db) {\n+            $command = $db->createCommand()\n+                ->update($this->cacheTable, [\n+                    'expire' => $duration > 0 ? $duration + time() : 0,\n+                    'data' => [$value, \\PDO::PARAM_LOB],\n+                ], ['id' => $key]);\n+            return $command->execute();\n+        });\n\n-        if ($command->execute()) {\n+        if ($result) {\n             $this->gc();\n\n             return true;\n@@ -214,12 +217,14 @@ class DbCache extends Cache\n         $this->gc();\n\n         try {\n-            $this->db->createCommand()\n-                ->insert($this->cacheTable, [\n-                    'id' => $key,\n-                    'expire' => $duration > 0 ? $duration + time() : 0,\n-                    'data' => [$value, \\PDO::PARAM_LOB],\n-                ])->execute();\n+            $this->db->noCache(function (Connection $db) {\n+                $db->createCommand()\n+                    ->insert($this->cacheTable, [\n+                        'id' => $key,\n+                        'expire' => $duration > 0 ? $duration + time() : 0,\n+                        'data' => [$value, \\PDO::PARAM_LOB],\n+                    ])->execute();\n+            });\n\n             return true;\n         } catch (\\Exception $e) {\n@@ -235,9 +240,11 @@ class DbCache extends Cache\n      */\n     protected function deleteValue($key)\n     {\n-        $this->db->createCommand()\n-            ->delete($this->cacheTable, ['id' => $key])\n-            ->execute();\n+        $this->db->noCache(function (Connection $db) {\n+            $this->db->createCommand()\n+                ->delete($this->cacheTable, ['id' => $key])\n+                ->execute();\n+        });\n\n         return true;\n     }\n```\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.8 |\n| PHP version | 5.5.9-1ubuntu4.17 |\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 14.04 LTS |\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11719/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11719/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
