this example from the documentation is incorrect https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/helper-array\r\n\r\n> Second argument that specifies keys to sort by can be a string if it's a single key, an array in case of multiple keys or an anonymous function like the following one:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nArrayHelper::multisort($data, function($item) {\r\n    return isset($item['age']) ? ['age', 'name'] : 'name';\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can't use this function because you need to know sorting keys (the result of this function) before this line https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/helpers/BaseArrayHelper.php#L651 \r\nbut currently, this function never evaluated before this line and just passed to `\\yii\\helpers\\BaseArrayHelper::getColumn` which will not return the column of the sorting array but will return `['age', 'name']` and those values will be sorted which makes no sense and don't sort an array.\r\n\r\nEven this example is wrong even if it doesn't generate an error:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n        $data = [\r\n            ['age' => 30, 'name' => 'Alexander'],\r\n            ['age' => 19,

can be fixed by adding this line:\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic static function multisort(&$array, $key, $direction = SORT_ASC, $sortFlag = SORT_REGULAR)\r\n    {\r\n        $key = $key instanceof \\Closure ? call_user_func($key) : $key;\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, there is a test case which expects that anonymous function will be passed to the `\\yii\\helpers\\BaseArrayHelper::getColumn` and will return modified values of the array (not keys that should be used for sorting):\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function testMultisortClosure()\r\n    {\r\n        $changelog = [\r\n            '- Enh #123:

ArrayHelper::multisort($changelog, function ($line) use (&$i) {\r\n            if (preg_match('/^- (Enh|Bug)( #\\d+)?: .+$/', $line, $m)) {\r\n                $o = ['Bug' => 'C', 'Enh' => 'D'];\r\n

This refers to a key name of the sub-array\r\n     * elements, a property name of the objects, or an anonymous function returning the values for comparison\r\n     * purpose. The anonymous function signature should be: `function($item)`.\r\n     * To sort by multiple keys, provide an array of keys here.\r\n     */\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt says that function should return values for comparison, not keys.\r\nSo, I think that incorrect behavior is described in the docs https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/helper-array\r\n\r\nExample in the docs should be something like this:\r\n```php\r\n        $data = [\r\n            ['age' => 30, 'name' => 'Alexander'],\r\n            ['age' => 19, 'name' => 'Barney'],\r\n            ['age' => 30, 'name' => 'Brian'],\r\n        ];\r\n        ArrayHelper::multisort($data, function ($item) {\r\n            return isset($item['age']) ? $item['age'] : $item['name'];\r\n        }, SORT_DESC);\r\n```\r\nBut you can sort only by one field in this case.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/502651679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alexkart","id":8249105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNDkxMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8249105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart","html_url":"https://github.com/alexkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"alexkart","id":8249105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNDkxMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8249105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart","html_url":"https://github.com/alexkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-17T12:39:10Z","updated_at":"2019-06-17T12:39:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17375","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17375/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17375/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17375/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/17375","id":456911981,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg4ODI4MjM4","number":17375,"title":"Closes #17372.
