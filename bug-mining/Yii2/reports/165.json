What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nchecking DNS in EmailValidator doesn't raise error if I enter wrong email. For example, `qwert@dfjkdfjkdf.dkdfj`\n### What is the expected result?\n\nI expect that it will be showing an error that email in invalid.\n### What do you get instead?\n\nNo error is shown.\n### Additional info\n\nif I use `checkdnsrr('dfjkdfjkdf.dkdfj', 'A')` it returns true but `checkdnsrr('dfjkdfjkdf.dkdfj', 'MX')` returns false.\n\nI think that error occurs because `checkdnsrr` also search over all subdomains of my hostname. If I append dot to domain name in `checkdnsrr` the problem disapears.\n\nSo I propose change line 99 in EmailValidator to:\n\n`$valid = checkdnsrr($matches['domain'] . '.', 'MX') || checkdnsrr($matches['domain'] . '.', 'A');`\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.9 |\n| PHP version | 5.6.26 |\n| Operating system | CentOS 6.0 |\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12714/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
