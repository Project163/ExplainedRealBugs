update the Yii2 version to **2.0.35** from 2.0.34 the _each_ validator doesn't work with _custom validation function._ I suspect #18012 to have cause this problem (or #17944?).\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nSet up custom validation function with each within a model class:\r\n```\r\npublic $staff_ids;\r\n\r\npublic function rules()\r\n{\r\n    return [\r\n        ...\r\n        ['staff_ids', 'each', 'rule' => ['string']],\r\n        [['staff_ids'], 'each', 'rule' => ['validateStaffIds']],\r\n        ...\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic function validateStaffIds($attribute, $params, $validator)\r\n{\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nFor each id within the staff_ids the custom validater validateStaffIds is called.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nError:\r\n`yii\\base\\UnknownMethodException: Calling unknown method: yii\\base\\DynamicModel::validateStaffIds() in /srv/http/ig-net/vendor/yiisoft/yii2/base/Component.php:300`\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.35\r\n| PHP version      | v7.4.5\r\n| Operating system | Manjaro 5.4.39\r\n| Webserver | Nginx 1.18\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18051/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
