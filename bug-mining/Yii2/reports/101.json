only support for add or merge value. But, sometimes we need to replace or unset original array (set to null doesnt mean unset it). Eg, in `common/config/main.php` we have config like this\n\n``` php\n'components' => [\n    'cache' => [\n        'class' => 'yii\\caching\\FileCache',\n        'cachePath' => '@common/runtime/cache',\n    ]\n]\n```\n\nThen in `backend` we have config\n\n``` php\n'components' => [\n    'cache' => [\n        'class' => 'yii\\caching\\DbCache',\n        'db' => ['dsn' => 'sqlite:@common/runtime/cache.db'],\n    ]\n]\n```\n\nIt will getting error because merged array still contain `cachePath` but `DbCache` has no `cachePath` property.\nAnother case. For non asosiated array, `ArrayHelper::merge()` always add new value to previous value.\n\n``` php\n'as access' => [\n    'class' => 'mdm\\admin\\components\\AccessControl',\n    'allowActions' => ['site/*', ],\n],\n// merge with\n'as access' => [\n    'class' => 'mdm\\admin\\components\\AccessControl',\n    'allowActions' => ['admin/*', ],\n],\n```\n\nWe cannot remove `'site/*'` value from array.\n## Solution\n\nI propose we introduce new class `None` and `Replace` (or another name class)\n\n``` php\nclass None\n{\n\n}\n\nclass Replace\n{\n    public $value;\n    public function __construct($value)\n    {\n        $this->value = $value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen in `ArrayHelper::merge()`\n\n``` php\n    public static function merge($a, $b)\n    {\n        $args = func_get_args();\n        $res = array_shift($args);\n        while (!empty($args)) {\n            $next = array_shift($args);\n            foreach ($next as $k => $v) {\n                if ($v instanceof None) {\n                    unset($res[$k]);\n                    continue;\n                }\n                if (is_int($k)) {\n                    if (isset($res[$k])) {\n                        $res[] = $v;\n                    } else {\n                        $res[$k] = $v;\n                    }\n                } elseif (is_array($v) && isset($res[$k]) && is_array($res[$k])) {\n                    $res[$k] = self::merge($res[$k], $v);\n                } else {\n                    $res[$k] = $v instanceof Replace ? $v->value : $v;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return $res;\n    }\n```\n## Usage\n\n``` php\n'components' => [\n    'cache' => [\n        'class' => 'yii\\caching\\DbCache',\n        'db' => ['dsn' => 'sqlite:@common/runtime/cache.db'],\n        'cachePath' => new None(),\n    ]\n],\n'as access' => [\n    'class' => 'mdm\\admin\\components\\AccessControl',\n    'allowActions' => new Replace(['admin/*', ]),\n],\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
