right, Samdark.\n\nThere's been a misunderstanding. You see, there is nothing wrong with the OCI8 extension. It continues to be maintained and actively increased by Oracle.\n\nNow you see the problem involving Yii. Access to databases of Yii2 was entirely Constructed under the PDO layer.\n\nOnly now, with version 7 of PHP, there is no active and valid extension pdo_oci. I spoke via Facebook with Wez Furlong, founder of pdo_oci extension - it does not work more with it.\n\nSee: https://pecl.php.net/package/PDO_OCI\n\nThus, Yii does not work with Oracle databases when running in an environment with PHP 7.\n\nIn my humble opinion, Yii should use from the beginning OCI8 and OCI11 extension since they were created by Oracle are actively maintained and have numerous features and optimizations that pdo_oci not have.\n\nYii in their next releases must implement a solution to work around this limitation, under penalty of having their impaired worldwide adoption. The Lavarel, for example, is supported via OCI8.\n\nFor me this is extremely worrying regarding the adoption of the framework for enterprise applications involving Oracle

you read carefully the article posted by SilverFire\nhttps://blogs.oracle.com/opal/entry/major_news_php_7_0\nIt say that an updated version of oci8 is avail via pecl but the new version of pdo_oci is only in source:\n\n> Thanks also to the Oracle staff who have worked on the internal rewrite necessary to make the OCI8 and **PDO_OCI extensions work with PHP 7**'s completely revamped Extension API.\n> \n> The Oracle Database OCI8 and PDO_OCI extensions are included in the PHP source distribution. \n> \n> PDO_OCI will remain solely part of the core PHP source distribution.\n\nIn fact if you download php7 sources you find it, and looking at code comments you can easily verify that is for php7\nThe only pitfall is that you need to compile and install it by hand and not via pecl, I give you some steps on how to.\n\nAt first you need to install oracle client and sdk, use the full version of the oracle client.\nUnfortunately I installed them ages ago and I don't remember the various steps to make them ready to compile pdo_oci and oci8.\nBy memory the steps I made should be the same you find here https://github.com/tassoevan/pdo-oci-extension#first-step-install-the-oracle-client\nDO NOT FOLLOW the compiling instruction of the above link since they are for php5\n\nThe instruction to compile pdo_oci are for debian/ubuntu system, but is easy to adapt for other systems.\n\n**Php7 source download**\nmkdir /opt/php7 \ncd /opt/php7\napt source -y php7.0\nNote: ensure you have deb-src enabled in your source.list\n\n**Compiling**\ncd php7.0-7.0.8/ext/pdo_oci\nphpize\nexport ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/instantclient/\n./configure\nmake\nmake test\n\n**Installing**\ncd module\ncp pdo_oci.so /usr/lib/php/20151012/\ncd /etc/php/7.0/mods-available\ncreate a file pdo_oci.ini with\n_; configuration for php pdo_oci module\nextension=pdo_oci.so_\n\nenable the new php module\nphpenmod pdo_oci\n\nrestart php fpm or apache if you installed php as apache mod\n\nservice php7.0-fpm restart\n\nWorks done!\nJust a side note, strangely restarting php fpm didn't load the module, while at command line was working. In the end I had to restart the computer to have the module loaded on php-fpm.\n\nHope it helps others. Maybe some note can be inserted in the manual so the people know that pdo_oci has been revamped by Oracle and yii2 is fully working with
