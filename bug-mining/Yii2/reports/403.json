Should I prepare a PR to Yii repo to remove introduced side effect?\r\n\r\nWhat was your motivation to assign a `from` property in `getTablesUsedInFrom` method?\r\nDoes it fix any bugs?\r\n\r\nThis side effect broke our application. We would rewrite it to have a better design, but I wanted to inform you about this change in case it was unconscious change.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. Implement `SomeActiveQuery` to be used by all models in the app. This class has `prepare` method which adds additional conditions to all queries with empty `ActiveQuery->from` property.\r\n1. Run `yii2/validators/UniqueValidator`.\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nThe Query has the additional condition.\r\n\r\n#### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nThe Query has no expected additional condition.\r\n\r\n#### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.13, 2.0.13.1\r\n| PHP version      | 7.1\r\n| Operating system | Windows 10 x64\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15353/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15353/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
