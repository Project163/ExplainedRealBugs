using `yii\\filters\\HttpCache` for etag generation, it should be configurable to allow generation of weak etags due to following problem:\n1. Yii generates _standard_ etag\n2. nginx modifies it to be a _weak_ etag\n3. the client sends `If-None-Match` with the weak etag\n4. Yii2 compares a weak to a non-weak etag, fails and re-sends response\n\nThis happens only when nginx has gzip compression enabled and with nginx >= 1.7 ( http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/rev/e491b26fa5a1 )\n\nI think a configurable option to generate _weak_ etags would be the best solution to that problem.\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11137/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11137/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
