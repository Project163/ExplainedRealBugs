is missing.\r\nThe property $conditionClasses is protected but it could be public, because the init() method in QueryBuilder overrides the initial value (see line 125: $this->conditionClasses = array_merge($this->defaultConditionClasses(), $this->conditionClasses);)\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.14\r\n| PHP version      | 7.0\r\n|
