But there is no MIME type for `tar.xz` or `tar.gz` (there are MIME types for `xz` and `gz`), and certainly there is no MIME type for `com.html` or `index.html`. Introducing some fancy non-standard system for detecting extensions may conflict with current MIME type checks.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/642549892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rob006","id":5972388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzIzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006","html_url":"https://github.com/rob006","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/642571163","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18094#issuecomment-642571163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18094","id":642571163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjU3MTE2Mw==","user":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-11T10:59:59Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T11:00:10Z","body":"It

In some cases, the developer need to make his own files or need to deal with with weird extensions files. For example, [Checkout this download page](https://quran.ksu.edu.sa/ayat/?l=en&pg=patches), you will find packages to be downloaded have the extension `ayt`.
