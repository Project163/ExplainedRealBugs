method [`\\yii\\db\\mssql\\QueryBuilder::resetSequence`](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/22889d314ab4ea20df00e594d4ef7fb09fa55f5a/framework/db/mssql/QueryBuilder.php#L253) don't calculate the `RESEED` value correctly.\n\nCurrently we use `\"SELECT COALESCE(MAX({$key}), 0) + 1 FROM {$tableName}\"`.\n\nThe official documentation [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkident-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#c-force-the-current-identity-value-to-a-new-value) specify than if the table as records, the next row will increment the value used in `RESEED`.\n\nSo if the max id is 10 and we set 11 in the `RESEED` the next row will use 12 as id and there will be a gap in the sequence.\n\nAn easy fix will be to use `\"SELECT COALESCE(MAX({$key}), 1) FROM {$tableName}\"`\n\nThe documentation also said [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkident-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#d-reset-the-identity-value-on-an-empty-table) than to reset an empty table sequence, the value to use depends on the way the table as been cleared.\n\nIf the table has been truncated we need to use 1 (because there will be no increment) but if it has been deleted we should use 0 because there will be an increment.\n\nWe could check in the `sys.identity_columns` table the field `last_value` to know if the table has been truncated or not (the value will be `null` in case of `TRUNCATE` and the last inserted id in case of `DELETE`","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20495/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
