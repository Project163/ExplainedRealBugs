What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n1. Create `\\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord`, eg. `Post`, and override `instantiate()`:\r\n```php\r\npublic static function instantiate($row) {\r\n\treturn Yii::$container->get(static::class);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Create `\\yii\\base\\Behavior`, eg. `PostBehavior`, which contains a new *user* relation for `Post`:\r\n```php\r\npublic function getUser() {\r\n\treturn $this->owner->hasOne(User::class, ['id' => 'user_id']);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Attach `PostBehavior` to `Post` using DI container definitions, eg.:\r\n```php\r\n'container' => [\r\n\t'definitions' => [\r\n\t\t'common\\models\\Post' => [\r\n\t\t\t'as myBehavior' => 'common\\behaviors\\PostBehavior',\r\n\t\t],\r\n\t],\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Execute `Post::find()->joinWith('user')->all();`\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nEverything works fine if `PostBehavior` is added directly inside `Post::behaviors()`, but fails when included through application's DI container definitions.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n>Invalid Parameter – yii\\base\\InvalidParamException\r\n>common\\models\\Post has no relation named \"user\".\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nThe problem appears to lie in [`\\yii\\db\\ActiveQuery::buildJoinWith()`](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/13de76714bd5482d0c2b9a68b7cb5d4977fc7bd0/framework/db/ActiveQuery.php#L439), where our ActiveRecord is being instantiated using `new $this->modelClass` rather than `Yii::createObject($this->modelClass)` thus causing the relations defined via DI-provided behaviors to be disregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.11\r\n| PHP version      | 5.6\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
