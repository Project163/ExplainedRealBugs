In case you need support please use one of\r\nYii communities listed at https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/wiki/communities\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nWhen using tabular data like:\r\n```php\r\necho $form->field($model, \"[$i]name\");\r\n```\r\nIf model has errors on attribute `name` this method does not set `aria-invalid` to `true`, because it looks for `$this->attribute` directly but its value is, for example, `[1]name`.\r\n```php\r\nprotected function addAriaAttributes(&$options)\r\n{\r\n    if ($this->addAriaAttributes) {\r\n        if (!isset($options['aria-required']) && $this->model->isAttributeRequired($this->attribute)) {\r\n            $options['aria-required'] = 'true';\r\n        }\r\n        if (!isset($options['aria-invalid']) && $this->model->hasErrors($this->attribute)) {\r\n            $options['aria-invalid'] = 'true';\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nA proper attribute name is needed. Like it is used in `ActiveField::addErrorClassIfNeeded()` method:\r\n```php\r\nprotected function addErrorClassIfNeeded(&$options)\r\n{\r\n    // Get proper attribute name when attribute name is tabular.\r\n    $attributeName = Html::getAttributeName($this->attribute);\r\n\r\n    if ($this->model->hasErrors($attributeName)) {\r\n        Html::addCssClass($options, $this->form->errorCssClass);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.43\r\n| PHP version      | 7.4.3\r\n| Operating system | Linux/Ubuntu\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
