What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nLet's say we have the following array:\r\n```php\r\n$array = [\r\n    'A' => [1, 2],\r\n    'B' => [\r\n        'C' => 1,\r\n        'D' => 2,\r\n        'E' => [\r\n            'F' => 1,\r\n            'G' => 2,\r\n            'H' => 3,\r\n        ],\r\n    ],\r\n    'I' => 1,\r\n];\r\n```\r\nIf we filter 1 or 2 levels deep, only the specified field will be returned as expected, e.g. \r\n```php\r\nArrayHelper::filter($array, ['B.D'])\r\n```\r\nwould return:\r\n```php\r\n[\r\n  \"B\" => [\r\n    \"D\" => 2, //Note that only D is set at this level (as expected)\r\n  ]\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if we filter 3 (or more) levels all data after the 2nd level will be returned, e.g. \r\n```php\r\nArrayHelper::filter($array, ['B.E.G']);\r\n```\r\nwould return:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n[\r\n  \"B\" => [\r\n    \"E\" =>[\r\n      \"F\" => 1, //Not expected\r\n      \"G\" => 2,\r\n      \"H\" => 3, //Not expected\r\n    ],\r\n  ],\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nOnly the specified node should be returned\r\n```php\r\n[\r\n  \"B\" => [\r\n    \"E\" =>[\r\n      \"G\" => 2,\r\n    ],\r\n  ],\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.30\r\n| PHP version      | 7.3.13\r\n| Operating system |
