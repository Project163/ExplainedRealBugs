`$model` array.\r\n\r\nRelated to this error I got a question if there is any need for `findWith()` when `asArray()` is used in [ActiveQuery:224](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/e353835cc57afacb18475edd33e53eddf9509e8d/framework/db/ActiveQuery.php#L224)?\r\nI tested `if (!empty($this->with) && !$this->asArray) {` to get around above error, but didn't have time to see if this messes up something else.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      |
