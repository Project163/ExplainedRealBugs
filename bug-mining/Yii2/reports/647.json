What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nSend a request to a RESTful endpoint with HTTP header `Accept` containing not supported by the server format (i.e `text/html`).\n### What is the expected result?\n\n`406 Not Acceptable` response code returned.\n### What do you get instead?\n\n`415 Unsupported Media Type` response code returned.\n### Additional info\n\nIn case server is incapable to respond with acceptable by client format it should return 406.\n415 should be returned only if server can't process received entity according to `Content-Type` header (requests like POST or PUT).\n\nContentNegotiator throws UnsupportedMediaTypeHttpException in that case.\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.9 |\n| PHP version | 5.5.9 |\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 14.04
