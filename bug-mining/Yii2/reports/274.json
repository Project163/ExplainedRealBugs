What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Add the SluggableBehavior to a class\r\n2. Set the value attribute to an annonymous function\r\n3. set 'immutable' => true for the slug\r\n4. Create a new record (RESULT Slug is generated correctly by the anonymous function)\r\n5. Update the record created in (4)\r\n \r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nThe old slug should stay unchanged, the anonymous function should not be called. The slug should not be replaced.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nA new slug is generated even though immutable is set to true\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nThis is similar to #6430 except that an anonymous function was not used in that issue.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.11.2\r\n| PHP version      | 5.6.30\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
