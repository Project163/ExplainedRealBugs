What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nI just run fixtures normally, and some of them need depends, but the execution don't respect the order\r\n\r\n> <?php\r\n\r\nnamespace common\\fixtures\\formgenerator;\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Fixture to load `SolicitudeValue` records.\r\n */\r\nclass SolicitudeValueFixture extends \\tecnocen\\formgenerator\\fixtures\\SolicitudeValueFixture\r\n{\r\n\t/**\r\n     * @inheritdoc\r\n     */\r\n    public $dataFile = '@common/fixtures/data/formgenerator/SolicitudeValue.php';\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @inheritdoc\r\n     */\r\n    public $depends = [\r\n        'common\\fixtures\\formgenerator\\FieldFixture',\r\n    \t'common\\fixtures\\formgenerator\\SolicitudeFixture',\r\n    \t'common\\fixtures\\formgenerator\\SectionFixture'\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nThe expected result is Execute FieldFixture, SolicitudFixture and SectionFixture before SolicitudValueFixture, but it doesn't happen, so SolicitudValue fails because it has foreign keys with the other tables.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nIn console I get this\r\n\r\n```\r\n12. formgenerator/DataType\r\n\t13. formgenerator/SolicitudeValue\r\n\t14. formgenerator/SectionField\r\n\t15. formgenerator/FieldRule\r\n\t16.
