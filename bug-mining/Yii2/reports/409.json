What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nThrow an exception anywhere in your code, make sure that `YII_DEBUG` is off and that you do not have a custom error action (`ErrorHandler::$errorAction`) configured:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nthrow new \\yii\\base\\Exception('Exception message with possibly sensitive information.');\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow make an AJAX request to the page that throws the exception and make sure that the response format is set to `Response::FORMAT_HTML`.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nResponse text: `<pre>An internal server error occurred.</pre>`\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nResponse text: `<pre>Exception message with possibly sensitive information.</pre>`\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n|
