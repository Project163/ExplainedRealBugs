What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nSerializing an empty generator returns `{}` instead of `[]`.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nA generator should be interpreted as a list of results not a dictionary.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nBecause `BaseJSON::processData()` applies special handling to objects and generators are objects this special handling is applied.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is this part:\r\n```php\r\n/*\r\n * $data type is changed to array here and its elements will be processed further\r\n * We must cast $data back to object later to keep intended dictionary type in JSON.\r\n * Revert is only done when keepObjectType flag is provided to avoid breaking BC\r\n */\r\n$revertToObject = static::$keepObjectType;\r\n\r\n$result = [];\r\nforeach ($data as $name => $value) {\r\n    $result[$name] = $value;\r\n}\r\n$data = $result;\r\n\r\n// Avoid empty objects to be returned as array (would break BC without keepObjectType flag)\r\nif ($data === []) {\r\n    $revertToObject = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo if the generator is empty then the result is an empty array and it is cast to an object. \r\nI believe that similar to other specific objects:\r\n```php\r\nif ($data instanceof JsExpression) {\r\n                $token = \"!{[$expPrefix=\" . count($expressions) . ']}!';\r\n                $expressions['\"' . $token . '\"'] = $data->expression;\r\n\r\n                return $token;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if ($data instanceof \\JsonSerializable) {\r\n                return static::processData($data->jsonSerialize(), $expressions, $expPrefix);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if ($data instanceof \\DateTimeInterface) {\r\n                return static::processData((array)$data, $expressions, $expPrefix);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if ($data instanceof Arrayable) {\r\n                $data = $data->toArray();\r\n            } elseif ($data instanceof \\SimpleXMLElement) {\r\n                $data = (array) $data;\r\n\r\n                // Avoid empty elements to be returned as array.\r\n                // Not breaking BC because empty array was always cast to stdClass before.\r\n                $revertToObject = true;\r\n            } \r\n```\r\nSpecial handling should be added for a generator.\r\nI'm willing to implement a PR for this.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.latest\r\n| PHP version      | N/A\r\n| Operating system | N/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19766/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
