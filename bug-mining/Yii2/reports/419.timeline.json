methods return `false` or write less bytes than expected\r\n- [ ] tests covered - not sure how to mock `fwrite()` error properly - possible solution is to do it like in the `/tests/framework/log/SyslogTargetTest.php` or to use `vfsStream` library but this is not included in the `composer.json` right now\r\n\r\n### DbTarget\r\n- [x] condition check based on whether the
