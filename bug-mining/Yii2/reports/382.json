What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nTry to build an `INSERT` query with a subquery passing params to `yii\\db\\QueryBuilder::insert()`:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$externalParams = [];\r\n// ...\r\n$externalParams[':param'] = 'value';\r\n// ...\r\n$sql = $this->getQueryBuilder()\r\n    ->insert(\r\n        'foo',\r\n        (new Query())\r\n            ->select('col')\r\n            ->from('t')\r\n            ->where(['col' => new Expression('expression with external :param')]),\r\n        $externalParams\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\n`$externalParams` contains the `:param` binding.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n`$externalParams` is empty.\r\nThe bug is in the **default** implementation of `insert()` in `yii\\db\\QueryBuilder`.\r\nI discovered it while preparing tests for #13879\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      |
