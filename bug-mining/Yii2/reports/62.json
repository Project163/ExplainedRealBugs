want to implement a custom authorization tool that does not support all the \"management\" functions defined in `ManagerInterface`\n\nThe only method that is used by the framework is `checkAccess`.\nI propose moving this method to a separate `AuthorizerInterface`, `ManagerInterface` would then extend the new interface.\n\nThe goal of this split is to separate the management of permissions and the checking of permissions. This change would not break backwards compatibility.\n\nAdvantage of this approach is also that it becomes easier to implement adapters to other authorization systems.\n\nCombined with this change I would also change the `yii\\web\\User` to accept a configuration for which authorizer it would use:\n\n```\n/**\n     * Returns auth manager associated with the user component.\n     *\n     * By default this is the `authManager` application component.\n     * You may override this method to return a different auth manager instance if needed.\n     * @return \\yii\\rbac\\ManagerInterface\n     * @since 2.0.6\n     */\n    protected function getAuthManager()\n    {\n        return Yii::$app->getAuthManager();\n    }\n```\n\nWould become:\n\n```\n    public $authorizer;\n    protected function getAuthManager()\n    {\n        return isset($this->authorizer) ? Yii::$app->get('authorizer') : Yii::$app->getAuthManager();\n    }\n```\n\nAllowing developers to change the component used via configuration, as is the common approach in the framework.\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11679/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
