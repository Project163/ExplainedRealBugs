for issue https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19324 causes new issue for dropDownList()\r\n\r\nWe have some dropDownList in search forms with both \"empty string value\" and \"zero value\", like this\r\n```\r\n<form action=\"...\" method=\"get\">\r\n<select>\r\n<option value=\"\">- select -</option>\r\n<option value=\"0\">House handed over</option>\r\n<option value=\"2022\">2022 Year</option>\r\n...\r\n</select>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Strict** parameter is not set for dropDownList().\r\n\r\nFirst render of form we get no one option with \"selected\" attribute.\r\n\r\nIn Yii 2.0.46 after form submit and page reload **without choosing any option** in this `<select>` we get \"zero value\" option selected `<option value=\"0\" selected>`\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Yii 2.0.46 we get no one option selected, without strict => true\r\nIn Yii 2.0.46 we have to set strict => true to reproduce previous behavior. \r\n\r\nIs this a bug or a feature?\r\nNow we need to fix a lot of fields in many forms to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n| Yii version | 2.0.46\r\n| PHP version | 7.4\r\n| Operating system |
