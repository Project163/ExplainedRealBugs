treats the `a` symbol as an _uppercase_ AM/PM marker, as demonstrated by the example table [here](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/datetime):\r\n\r\n> Format Pattern | Result\r\n> -- | --\r\n> h:mm a | 12:08 PM\r\n> hh 'o''clock' a, zzzz | 12 o'clock PM, Pacific Daylight Time\r\n> K:mm a, z | 0:00 PM, PST\r\n\r\nAs expected, `Yii::$app->formatter->asTime('now', 'a')` will return `AM` or `PM`.\r\n\r\nHowever `yii\\helpers\\FormatConverter::convertDateIcuToPhp()` translates `a` ICU symbols right back into (lowercase) `a`, which in PHP represents a _lowercase_ `am` or `pm`, per [PHP’s date() documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php):\r\n\r\n> format character | Description | Example returned values\r\n> -- | -- | --\r\n> a | Lowercase Ante meridiem and Post meridiem | am or pm\r\n> A | Uppercase Ante meridiem and Post meridiem | AM or PM\r\n\r\nThis results in inconsistent casing on AM/PM output, depending on whether the time was formatted via ICU or PHP. (See craftcms/cms#2218 for an example.)\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nCall `yii\\helpers\\FormatConverter::convertDateIcuToPhp('a', 'time')`.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nEither `AM` or `PM` will be returned.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nEither `am` or `pm` will be returned.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.13.1\r\n| PHP version      | 7.2\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 16.04\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
