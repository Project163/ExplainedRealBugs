In case you need support please use one of\r\nYii communities listed at https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/wiki/communities\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSuppose we have AR relation with composite link and we want to get aggregated data on it. Here is modified example from guide:\r\n```php\r\nclass Customer extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * Defines read-only virtual property for aggregation data.\r\n     */\r\n    public function getOrdersCount()\r\n    {\r\n        if ($this->isNewRecord) {\r\n            return null; // this avoid calling a query searching for null primary keys\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        return empty($this->ordersAggregation) ? 0 : $this->ordersAggregation[0]['counted'];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Declares normal 'orders' relation.\r\n     */\r\n    public function getOrders()\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->hasMany(Order::className(), ['customer_id' => 'id', 'extra' => 'extra']);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Declares new relation based on 'orders', which provides aggregation.\r\n     */\r\n    public function getOrdersAggregation()\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->getOrders()\r\n            ->select(['customer_id', 'extra', 'counted' => 'count(*)'])\r\n            ->groupBy(['customer_id', 'extra'])\r\n            ->asArray(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this case lazy loading works fine, but eager loading always returns zero:\r\n```php\r\n$customer = Customer::findOne($pk);\r\n$customer->ordersCount; // works fine\r\n\r\nforeach (Customer::find()->with('ordersAggregation')->all() as $customer) {\r\n    echo $customer->ordersCount; // always 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe problem is in the way how ```Query``` builds buckets from query results:\r\n```php\r\nprivate function getModelKey($model, $attributes)\r\n{\r\n    $key = [];\r\n    foreach ($attributes as $attribute) {\r\n        $key[] = $this->normalizeModelKey($model[$attribute]);\r\n    }\r\n    if (count($key) > 1) {\r\n        return serialize($key); // <--- here is the problem\r\n    }\r\n    $key = reset($key);\r\n    return is_scalar($key) ? $key : serialize($key);\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nRelated query results produce bucket keys like ```a:2:{i:0;s:1:\\\"7\\\";i:1;s:1:\\\"1\\\";}```. At this time primary AR model produce keys like ```a:2:{i:0;i:7;i:1;i:1;}``` because they have typecasted attribute values. So  related  results buckets won't be found and we always get 0.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.15.1\r\n| PHP version      |  7.1.16\r\n| Operating system | Mac OS 10.13.4\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16492/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16492/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
