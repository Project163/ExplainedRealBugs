Alexander, thanks for your reply. \r\n\r\nCurrent CORS standards(both [W3C CORS](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) and [WHATWG fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) standard) have a clear definition for the wildcard `*`, which means any domain is allowed. But they also have another important security requirement: `Origin: *` and `Credentials: true` cannot be used at the same time, to avoid overly loose permissions. Currently all browsers follow this requirement to disallow this configuration combination.\r\n\r\nIf a framework actively converts `*` to reflect any origin header value,  it means  `Origin: *` and `Credentials: true` can be used at the same time. This behavior leads to CORS protocol's security design to be bypassed, causing many misconfiguration security problems.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest frameworks to follow the standard definition of `*`.  When a user configures `Origin:*`,  frameworks just directly returns `Access-control-Allow-Access: *`. When a user configures both `Origin:*` and `Credentials: true` , frameworks  should warn users that this is a misconfiguration because browsers will not accept this combination.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/385341330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chenjj","id":2682905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODI5MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2682905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj","html_url":"https://github.com/chenjj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/385353620","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16193#issuecomment-385353620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16193","id":385353620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTM1MzYyMA==","user":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T09:45:47Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T09:45:47Z","body":"Agree.
