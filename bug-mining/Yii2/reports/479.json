What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nSuppose my magic getter throws an error that is not an exception.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nCalling `isset($obj->throwError)` should return `false`. \r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nDue to this code:\r\n```php\r\npublic function __isset($name)\r\n    {\r\n        try {\r\n            return $this->__get($name) !== null;\r\n        } catch (\\Exception $e) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nExceptions are caught but errors are not.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to not use a typehint here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | dev-master\r\n| PHP version      | 7.2\r\n| Operating system |
