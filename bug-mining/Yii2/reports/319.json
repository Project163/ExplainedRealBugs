What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nI changed rule class in appliction config `yii\\web\\RuleManager::$ruleConfig` on my own, which extends from `yii\\web\\UrlRule`.\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nUrlManager create UrlRules as my custom class instance.\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nI get old UrlRules from cache with `yii\\web\\UrlRule` class names.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nProblem has gone when i add some new rules into `yii\\web\\RuleManager::$rules`. This happens because `yii\\web\\UrlManager::init()` calculate hash for cache only from rules without `$ruleConfig`.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif ($this->cache instanceof Cache) {\r\n    $cacheKey = $this->cacheKey;\r\n    $hash = md5(json_encode($this->rules));\r\n    if (($data = $this->cache->get($cacheKey)) !== false && isset($data[1]) && $data[1] === $hash) {\r\n        $this->rules = $data[0];\r\n    } else {\r\n        $this->rules = $this->buildRules($this->rules);\r\n        $this->cache->set($cacheKey, [$this->rules, $hash]);\r\n    }\r\n} else {\r\n    $this->rules = $this->buildRules($this->rules);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.11\r\n| PHP version      | 5.6.27\r\n| Operating system | deb8u1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
