This breaks the InlineValidators that'd use $this->$attribute in an inline anonymous function.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nHave a model with an array attribute.\r\nCreate a rule in your model with EachValidator, and as a rule set an inline function, causing an InlineValidator instance to be created. In this inline anonymous function, try checking if the members of the array are valid by accessing $this->$attribute.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n$this should be the actual object on which the function was called, $this->$attribute should be one member of the array in each call.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n$this is bound to the original Model class, and $this->$attribute is the array attribute.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.35\r\n| PHP version      | 7.4\r\n| Operating system | Windows\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18096/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
