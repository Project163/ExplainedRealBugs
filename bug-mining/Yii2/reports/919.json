to the PHPDoc for \\yii\\web\\Request::getBodyParams():\n\n```\n/**\n * @return array|object the request parameters given in the request body.\n */\n```\n\nHowever, the method always returns an array, never an object—even when the raw request body is a JSON object (e.g. { \"name\": \"John\" }).\n\nExpected behavior (based on the PHPDoc):\nIf the input is a JSON object, getBodyParams() should return array<string,mixed>.\n\nActual behavior:\nIt always returns an array, but the PHPdoc hints array|object\n\nPlease clarify whether this is a documentation issue or if the method should actually support returning objects.\n\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
