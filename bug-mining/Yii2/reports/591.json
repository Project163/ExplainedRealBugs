Enable javascript strict mode (which happens automatically when you combine scripts e.g. with browserify)\r\n2. Create a form with client validation enabled\r\n3. Validate the form\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nNo error on client validation even in strict mode.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n```\r\nyii.activeForm.js:868 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'input' of undefined\r\n    at k (yii.activeForm.js:868)\r\n    at O (yii.activeForm.js:710)\r\n    at yii.activeForm.js:410\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the proposed fix?\r\n\r\nThere's a bug in `yii.activeForm.js` around line 710:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n        if (submitting) {\r\n            var errorAttributes = [];\r\n            var $input = findInput($form, this);\r\n            $.each(data.attributes, function () {\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `this` in the `$input = ...` line is not defined. The assignment must be moved inside the `$.each()`.\r\n\r\nI'll provide a pull request with this fix.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.17\r\n| PHP version      |  7.3.3\r\n| Operating system | Alpine\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17341/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
