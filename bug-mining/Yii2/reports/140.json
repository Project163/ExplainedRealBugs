have two problems with pjax and maybe someone can help me. I have one pjax form which with get params reload grid view. And grid view have pjax filters which reload grid again. So my problems is:\n1. if I submit form it adds all params to url and convert space to \"+\" like this \"?name=my+name\". But now if I use grid filter it add new params to url and convert \"+\" to \"?name=my%2Bname&search=test\". So in result php will get \"my+name\" instead of \"my name\".\n2. second problem is duplicate url params. If I use my form and grid filters many times, I get duplicate params in url like this \"?name=&name=&search=&search=\".\n\nAny ideas how to fix any of these issues?\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.8 |\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11921/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
