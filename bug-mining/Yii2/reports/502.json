added to the latest basic template with yii 2.0.12 to the LoginForm model a simple required attribute:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    public $gender;\r\n...\r\n    [['username', 'password', 'gender'], 'required'],\r\n```\r\nand a radioList imput field to the login form (I've removed the fieldsConfig option from ActiveForm):\r\n```\r\n...\r\n   <?php $form = ActiveForm::begin([\r\n        'id' => 'login-form',\r\n        'layout' => 'horizontal',\r\n    ]); ?>\r\n...\r\n    <?= $form->field($model, 'gender')->label('Gender')->radioList([1 => 'male', 2 => 'female']) ?>\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThis simple input generates two HTML validation error using W3C validation:\r\n```\r\nError: Element div is missing one or more of the following attributes: aria-expanded, aria-valuemax, aria-valuemin, aria-valuenow, role.\r\nFrom line 44, column 56; to line 44, column 103\r\n  value=\"\"><div id=\"loginform-gender\" aria-required=\"true\"><div c\r\nAttributes for element div:\r\n  Global attributes\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: The for attribute of the label element must refer to a non-hidden form control.\r\nFrom line 42, column 1; to line 42, column 61\r\nequired\">↩<label class=\"control-label col-sm-3\" for=\"loginform-gender\">Gender\r\n```\r\nNote that the second error comes up only if the `label` method is explicitly using.\r\n\r\nI would expect, that simple forms and fields generates HTML without validation errors.\r\n\r\nNote also, that there are also 2 warning,associated with the navigation and the form:\r\n```\r\nWarning: The navigation role is unnecessary for element nav.\r\nFrom line 16, column 5; to line 16, column 82\r\nrap\">↩    <nav id=\"w0\" class=\"navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top navbar\" role=\"navigation\"><div c\r\n```\r\n```\r\nWarning: The form role is unnecessary for element form.\r\nFrom line 31, column 5; to line 31, column 111\r\n</p>↩↩    <form id=\"login-form\" class=\"form-horizontal\" action=\"/index.php?r=site%2Flogin\" method=\"post\" role=\"form\">↩<inpu\r\n```\r\n### Additional info\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.12\r\n| PHP version      |  7.1.5\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu
