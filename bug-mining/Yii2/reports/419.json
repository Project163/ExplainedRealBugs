Use default configuration of `yii\\swiftmailer\\Mailer` and configure `EmailTarget` for errors. Log error.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nWarning that email can not be sent.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nNothing. `swiftmailer` [swallows `mail()` errors and returns `false`](https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/blob/v5.4.8/lib/classes/Swift/Transport/SimpleMailInvoker.php#L33-L37), but `EmailTarget` [ignores `send()` result](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/ba0ab403b52124c941dbeb46fbd9efdc12252a5d/framework/log/EmailTarget.php#L85).
