are some confusions with the ListView attributes and some minor issues as well.\n\nAssume this ListView here:\n\n``` php\n<?= ListView::widget([\n    'dataProvider' => $dataProvider,\n    'summary' => 'My Summary',\n    'summaryOptions' => ['class' => 'bold'],\n    'options' => ['class' => 'bordered bgwhite'],\n    'itemOptions' => ['class' => 'item'],\n    'itemView' => '_list-item',\n    'showOnEmpty' => false,\n]); ?>\n```\n\nFirst of all, when i modify the `summary` attribute, the content is not rendered in a `tag` but it's just text. So `summaryOptions` does not apply the class to the summary text.\n\nAnd next, according to the docs, `showOnEmpty` is :\n\n> Whether to show the list view if $dataProvider returns no data.\n\nBut when the `showOnEmpty` attribute is `false`, i still see the listview with the empty text inside. When `true` i see the listview with nothing inside.\n\nShouldn't it be:\n- when `false` => don't show the list view container at all\n- when `true` => show the listview with the empty text?\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.8 |\n| PHP version | 7.0.2 |\n| Operating system | Windows 7 |\n","closed_by":{"login":"klimov-paul","id":1482054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul","html_url":"https://github.com/klimov-paul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimov-paul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11627/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
