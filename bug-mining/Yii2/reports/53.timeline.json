I confirmed the behavior.\n\nRedirecting the \"main\" page when an AJAX request returns a `302` is not standard, it is implemented by Yii: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/assets/yii.js#L326\n\nFrom 2.0.8 onwards, as is listed in the documentation for `loginRequired()`, if a redirect is not applicable an `403` is thrown:\n\n```\n/**\n     * Redirects the user browser to the login page.\n     *\n     * Before the redirection, the current URL (if it's not an AJAX url) will be kept as [[returnUrl]] so that\n     * the user browser may be redirected back to the current page after successful login.\n     *\n     * Make sure you set [[loginUrl]] so that the user browser can be redirected to the specified login URL after\n     * calling this method.\n     *\n     * Note that when [[loginUrl]] is set, calling this method will NOT terminate the application execution.\n     *\n     * @param boolean $checkAjax whether to check if the request is an AJAX request. When this is true and the request\n     * is an AJAX request, the current URL (for AJAX request) will NOT be set as the return URL.\n     * @param boolean $checkAcceptHeader whether to check if the request accepts HTML responses. Defaults to `true`. When this is true and\n     * the request does not accept HTML responses the current URL will not be SET as the return URL. Also instead of\n     * redirecting the user an ForbiddenHttpException is thrown. This parameter is available since version 2.0.8.\n     * @return Response the redirection response if [[loginUrl]] is set\n     * @throws ForbiddenHttpException the \"Access Denied\" HTTP exception if [[loginUrl]] is not set or a redirect is\n     * not applicable.\n     * @see checkAcceptHeader\n     */\n```\n\nSo in my opinion the default behavior was changed, and this change was planned. (Note I'm not in the Yii team).\nIf it was planned I guess the upgrade notes should be updated; if it was not planned then changing the default value of `loginRequired()` would revert to the old behavior, but also implicitly disable the new functionality for all request checked via the `AccessControl` filter.\n\nWe could add `\"*/*\"` to `yii\\web\\User::$acceptableRedirectTypes`, as @dmitry-kulikov mentioned. This has some downsides as well; for example: `$.getJSON('/')` will send this header:\n\n```\nAccept:application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01\n```\n\nIn this case `'*/*'` is acceptable, but it is definitely not desirable.\n\nThe best solution I see is separately checking if `'*/*'` is the only acceptable type in `checkRedirectAcceptable()`. If it is and `$acceptableRedirectTypes` is not empty then we can return

I did a little bit more testing:\n`$.ajax('http://localhost:8080/backend/web/index.php');` - no redirect;\n`$.ajax('http://localhost:8080/backend/web/index.php', {dataType: 'html'});` -
