Many aspects are concerning. For instance, we're running Psalm at error level 1 (with one exception - MixedAssignment) - while 2.0.52 shows no errors, 2.0.53 suddenly reports 197 new errors! Given that Psalm serves as our CI quality gate, these typing changes effectively break backward compatibility.\n\nYii 2.0.53\n```php\n * @psalm-type RegisterJsFileOptions = array{\n *     depends?: class-string[],\n *     position?: int,\n *     appendTimestamp?: boolean\n * }\n```\n\nCode\n```php\n$this->jsOptions = [\n    'type' => 'module',\n    'crossorigin' => true,\n];\n```\n\nPsalm error level 1:\n\n> ERROR: InvalidPropertyAssignmentValue - $this->jsOptions with declared type 'array{appendTimestamp?: bool, depends?: array<array-key, class-string>, position?: int}' cannot be assigned type 'array{crossorigin: true, type: 'module'}' (see https://psalm.dev/145)\n\nWe should either be more cautious with such additions or at minimum document them properly in UPGRADE.md\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20453/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/20453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
