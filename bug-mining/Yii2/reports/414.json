discussed here: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-bootstrap/issues/228 it would make sense to implement this feature in the core ActiveForm/ActiveField as it could be a behavior for other CSS Frameworks as well (If bootstrap does, others will maybe follow).\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nNew Bootstrap 4 Framework requires form validation on the Input element since beta 2. An example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"col-md-3 mb-3\">\r\n      <labe>Zip</label>\r\n      <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control is-invalid\" placeholder=\"Zip\">\r\n      <div class=\"invalid-feedback\">Please provide a valid zip.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nAn option to configure which element should contain the validation class in ActiveForm / ActiveField.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nIts not possible yet.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-bootstrap/issues/228\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.13.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/15476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
