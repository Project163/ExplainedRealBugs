following common docs examples on implementing behaviors by doing this: \n\n``` php\nclass TokenController extends \\yii\\rest\\Controller\n{\n\n    public function behaviors()\n    {\n        $behaviors = parent::behaviors();\n\n        $behaviors['corsFilter'] = [\n            'class' => \\yii\\filters\\Cors::className(),\n        ];\n\n        $behaviors['authenticator'] = [\n            'class' => \\yii\\filters\\auth\\HttpBearerAuth::className(),\n            'except' => ['options'],\n        ];\n\n        return $behaviors;\n    }\n```\n\nthe $behaviors outputs structure will look like this: \n\n```\nArray\n(\n    [contentNegotiator] => Array(...)\n    [verbFilter] => Array(...)\n    [authenticator] => Array(...)\n    [rateLimiter] => Array(...)\n    [corsFilter] => Array(...)\n)\n```\n\n`corsFilter` will always be sent to the bottom of the array and treated after `authenticator` because only `authenticator` is defined in the parent array at `yii\\rest\\Controller::behaviors()` (see code [here](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/rest/Controller.php#L46)) which raises those kind of errors in browsers:\n\n```\nXMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost/foundapps/backend/auth/token/revoke. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8079' is therefore not allowed access.\n```\n\nThis is expected as it is already mentioned in CORS [docs](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-structure-filters.html#cors) :\n\n> The Cors filter should be defined before Authentication / Authorization filters to make sure the CORS headers will always be sent.\n\nIt usually happens when authentication fails like a request header holding an expired token so CORS won't be reached. To prevent the issue we could merge arrays without defining keys as it is done in the CORS docs I just linked (authentication will be defined twice but the one we need will be sent to bottom and CORS will be treated) or we can simply define CORS in `yii\\rest\\Controller` with its default values (see [here](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/filters/Cors.php#L81-L88)) which I think it should be fine as it is a must do when doing REST web apps any way.\n\nThis may fix #10405, #6254 and #8626 and could also be related to  #6804 and
