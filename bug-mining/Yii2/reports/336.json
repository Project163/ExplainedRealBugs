I have a nested module hierarchy:\r\n````\r\nApp <- A <- B <- C\r\n````\r\n\r\nMy module A loads its translation doing something similar to:\r\n````\r\n$this->module->get('i18n')->....\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nIt uses its parent, which is a descendant of `Module` and thus of `ServiceLocator` to retrieve a dependency.\r\nNow consider a different configuration:\r\n````\r\nApp <- B <- A <- C\r\n````\r\nThe `B` module has no user facing parts, so it does not know or care about i18n. Module A will however be broken as well since it can no longer locate an i18n component.\r\n\r\nWhile there are arguments for:\r\n1. Injecting dependencies\r\n2. Configuration `i18n` in module `B` so it is available to `A`.\r\n\r\nHowever a simple solution that could work very intuitively as well is to have the `ServiceLocator` class hand off a request to its parent if it cannot fulfill it.\r\nThis solution will not break backwards compatibility but add more flexibility for modules and will stop forcing them to use `Yii::$app` as a global service locator.\r\n\r\nAs a side note the boolean argument `$throwException` should be removed, it is not needed for performance, instead, calling code should just catch the exception.\r\n\r\nNote that currently `ServiceLocator` has no concept of a parent, so this should be implemented at the module level:\r\n1. `$module->get()`\r\n2. If we have a parent, go to 3, otherwise 4.\r\n3. Call `parent::get()`, catching any exception.\r\n4. Forward call via `$this->module->get()`, don't catch exception.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SamMousa","id":547021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/547021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa","html_url":"https://github.com/SamMousa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamMousa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
