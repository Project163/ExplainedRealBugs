What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nSetup before and afterValidate events for form, for example for blocking submit button:\n\n``` javascript\n  $('form').on('beforeValidate', function (e) {\n    $(e.target).find(':submit').prop('disabled', true);\n    console.log('beforeValidate');\n  }).on('afterValidate', function (e) {\n    $(e.target).find(':submit').prop('disabled', false);\n    console.log('afterValidate');\n  });\n```\n### What is the expected result?\n\nBoth event triggered\n### What do you get instead?\n\nOnly beforeValidate event happens\n### Additional info\n\nIn yii.activeForm.js afterValidate event described as it is triggered after validating the whole form.\nBut actually it happens only after validation triggered by form submission: see updateInputs method: it placed only if submitting is true\n![2016-08-04 20 27 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2317913/17400273/f580d464-5a81-11e6-89fb-d99af7242baf.png)\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | ---
