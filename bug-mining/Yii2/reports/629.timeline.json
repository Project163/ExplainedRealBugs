see the middleware already contains IP filtering so I would raise the following issues and suggestions. \r\n\r\nThe following examples are based on the use of yii2.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nYii2's basic idea of ​​secure networks, headers, and IP definition is too simple.\r\n- On the one hand, there is an unnecessary function in the Request class `trustedHosts` and `secureHeaders` when not in use.\r\n- On the other hand, it is difficult or impossible to handle some of the networks schema.\r\n\r\nThe yii2 solution unnecessarily write conditions in the code that are difficult to redefine.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of network resolution:\r\n- check IP by ISP or reverse DNS\r\n- check route by network endpoints sequence (example from X-Forwarded-For header)\r\n- check and skip optional route's IP, if needed\r\n- check and skip route loops\r\n- get IP by tagged endpoint (The multiple routes require the IP addresses of the network endpoints, which may check and get the first, the last, all and exists.)\r\n- resolve user IP from accepted sequenced route\r\n\r\nThe former need not be integrated into the framework, but should be defined as an interface with a separate layer.\r\n\r\n### Suggests\r\n\r\n```php\r\ninterface NetworkResolverInterface {\r\n  public function getRemoteIp(): string;\r\n  public function getUserIp(): string;\r\n  public function getIsSecureConnection(): bool;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass Request ... {\r\n   private $networkResolver;\r\n\r\n   __construct(..) {\r\n     $this->networkResolver = SimpleNetworkResolver(); // use REMOTE_ADDR, SERVER_PORT etc.\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   public function withNetworkResolver(NetworkResolver $resolver) {..}\r\n   public function getNetworkResolver(): NetworkResolver {...}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nexample `TrustedHostsResolver` class is the equivalent of yii2 trusted hosts.\r\n\r\n| Q | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Version | 1.0.0-under

getIsSecureConnection() is likely wrong that it first checks $_SERVER and only then falls back to secure headers. If headers are trusted then they should be preferred. Current code should fail if client is using HTTP but load balancer uses HTTPS to communicate to Yii2 App.\r\n\r\nI think there is little point in further developing this in Yii2. If you set up IP resolving on your web server (e.g `ngx_http_realip_module`), you can obviously assume that you trust it. This is equivalent to using `trustedHosts = [0.0.0.0/0]`. This is actually a kind of use of the `turstedHosts` functionality.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you enable `trustedHost = [0.0.0.0/0]`, it will try to re-resolv the user's IP address based on `X-Forwarded-For` (the web server cannot be expected to delete this header). The PR improve this. (https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/17569)\r\n\r\nThe https://github.com/yiisoft/yii-web/issues/119 issue allows you to define additional network resolver classes for such cases, but for Yii2 this would only add more complexity to the `Request` class, which is unreasonable in terms of resolving the problem.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/538218173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kamarton","id":9432032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzIwMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9432032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton","html_url":"https://github.com/kamarton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/538250139","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17521#issuecomment-538250139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17521","id":538250139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzODI1MDEzOQ==","user":{"login":"kamarton","id":9432032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzIwMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9432032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton","html_url":"https://github.com/kamarton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-04T05:59:15Z","updated_at":"2019-10-04T05:59:15Z","body":"Probably
