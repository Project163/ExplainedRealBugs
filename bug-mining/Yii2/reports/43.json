an element in the `component` applciation configuration can be a closure:\n\n``` php\n    'components' => [\n        'pheanstalk' => function() {\n            $result = new \\Pheanstalk\\Pheanstalk('localhost');\n            $result->watch('daily');\n            return $result;\n        },\n```\n\nThis is fine, but does not work when my object depends on other components and I want to use DI:\n\n``` php\n    'components' => [\n        'pheanstalk' => function(yii\\web\\User $user) {\n            $result = new \\Pheanstalk\\Pheanstalk('localhost');\n            $result->watch($user->getId());\n\n            return $result;\n        },\n```\n\nSince we now have `Container::invoke` we could simply use that:\n\n``` php\npublic static function createObject($type, array $params = [])\n    {\n        if (is_string($type)) {\n            return static::$container->get($type, $params);\n        } elseif (is_array($type) && isset($type['class'])) {\n            $class = $type['class'];\n            unset($type['class']);\n            return static::$container->get($class, $params, $type);\n        } elseif (is_callable($type, true)) {\n            return call_user_func($type, $params);\n        } elseif (is_array($type)) {\n            throw new InvalidConfigException('Object configuration must be an array containing a \"class\" element.');\n        } else {\n            throw new InvalidConfigException('Unsupported configuration type: ' . gettype($type));\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nChanging `call_user_func($type, $params)` to `Yii::$container->invoke($type, [$params]);` would be backwards compatible.\n1. It adds an array around `$params`, making it the first positional argument.\n2. Invoke will fill any dependencies then pass the `$params` array (which is never set in this use case) as the first positional argument that is not explicitly type hinted for DI.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10908/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
