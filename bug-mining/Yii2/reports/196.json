Minimal example:\n\nconfig.php:\n\n``` php\n'components' => [\n    'cache' => [\n        'class' => 'yii\\caching\\FileCache',\n    ],\n    'volatileCache' => 'yii\\caching\\ArrayCache',\n    ...\n],\n```\n\ncontroller.php:\n\n``` php\n// insert appropriate namespace and use statements here\nclass TestController extends \\yii\\console\\Controller\n{\n    private $_parsedContent;\n\n\n    private function loadFromCache()\n    {\n        // Cache is volatile -> get('isModified') evaluates to false when first executed\n        if (!Yii::$app->volatileCache->get('isModified')) {\n            var_dump(\"Invalid Cache!\");\n            $this->_parsedContent = json_decode(Yii::getAlias('@app/someconfig.json'), true);\n            Yii::$app->volatileCache->set('isModified', $value =

of php (in an editor)\n        $this->loadFromCache(); // Expected output: Invalid Cache! (But thats not happening)\n        sleep(4); //  Total waittime now 6 seconds -> Cache invalidates after 5\n        $this->loadFromCache(); // Output: Invalid Cache! (But because of the regular timeout)\n    }\n}\n```\n### Problem Analysis\n\nInterestingly enough the above example does work when using the `FileCache` component in favor of the `ArrayCache` component. Since I could not trace any direct call on `clearstatcache`, I assume that the stat cache is implicitly cleared by PHP after either of the calls to `file_put_contents`, `chmod` and `touch` inside `FileCache::setValue`.\n\nProbably the easiest way to fix this bug is to explicitly call `clearstatcache` inside `FileDependency::generateDependencyData`, i.e. modify it as follows:\n\n``` php\nprotected function generateDependencyData($cache)\n{\n    if ($this->fileName === null) {\n        throw new InvalidConfigException('FileDependency::fileName must be set');\n    }\n\n    clearstatcache(false, Yii::getAlias($this->fileName));\n    return @filemtime(Yii::getAlias($this->fileName));\n}\n```\n### Additional info\n\nYii: 2.0.9\nPHP: 7.0.8-0ubuntu0.16.04.2 (cli)\n\nP.S.
