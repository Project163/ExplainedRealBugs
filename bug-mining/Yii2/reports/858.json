This property should take a list of supported\r\n     * authentication methods, each represented by an authentication class or configuration.\r\n     *\r\n     * If this property is empty, no authentication will be performed.\r\n     *\r\n     * Note that an auth method class must implement the [[\\yii\\filters\\auth\\AuthInterface]] interface.\r\n     */\r\n    public $authMethods = [];\r\n```\r\nI'd expect that the only requirement is to implement the mentioned interface.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n#19418 blindly calls a function `isActive` which is not in defined in `AuthInterface`, without checking whether the concrete authentication method implemention actually extends `ActionFilter`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nFix it so that it checks whether the auth method extends `ActionFilter` before blindly calling a function on it:\r\n```php\r\nif ($auth instanceof \\yii\\base\\ActionFilter) && isset($this->owner->action) && $auth->isActive($this->owner->action)) {\r\n                $identity = $auth->authenticate($user, $request, $response);\r\n                if ($identity !== null) {\r\n                    return $identity;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will fix the issue without breaking stuff. It'll even leave the \"bugfix\" intact. \r\nNote that the original bugfix still leaves room for changed behavior; for example when an auth method is used inside `CompositeAuth`, no events are fired since the filter's `beforeFilter` and `afterFilter` methods are never called. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.46\r\n| PHP version      | N/A\r\n| Operating system | N/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
