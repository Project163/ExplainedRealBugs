have a standalone action.\nIt is designed to work with csrf validation disabled to avoid error 400 \"Unable to verify your data submission.\" As it is standalone I supposed to disable csrf validation in `Action::beforeRun()` method, as:\n\n```\nprotected function beforeRun() {\n        \\Yii::$app->controller->enableCsrfValidation = false;\n        return true;\n}\n```\n\nBut it takes no effect and seems the only way to do this is to use `Controller::beforeAction()`, but it wisely to have an ability to manage csrf validation in `Action::beforeRun()` for my opinion, since it is called \"standalone\" action.\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
