It made me believe it was not possible to directly get JSON data from a REST request as an object. I converted to objects in my code adding an unnecessary step._\r\n\r\n### Description of the problem?\r\n\r\nThe return type for the `yii\\web\\Request` method `getBodyParams()` in the PHPDoc is `array`. However, the 'yii\\web\\JsonParser' can be configured (property `asArray`) to return objects instead of arrays. This works fine but contradicts the PHPDoc for the `getBodyParams()` method.\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.43\r\n| PHP version      |  7.4\r\n| Operating system | Mac OSX\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18908/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18908/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
