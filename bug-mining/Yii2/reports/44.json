of our employees got a weird error when he used an asset like\n\n``` php\nclass MyBuggyAsset extends AssetBundle\n{\n    public $sourcePath = '@webroot/assets';\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nYes, I know this is incorrect, but the effect is quite unpleasant. In some cases, Yii2 copies recursively all the assets again to the folder in assets. If `MyBuggyAsset`'s hash is `cccccc`, we get a directory tree like\n- aaaaaa\n- bbbbbb\n- ccccccc\n  - aaaaaa\n  - bbbbbb\n  - cccccc\n    - aaaaaa\n    - bbbbbb\n    - ccccccc\n      - ...\n\nA simple fix would be adding a check in `BaseFileHelper`'s `copyDirectory`, to check if destination is a child of source.\n\n``` php\npublic static function copyDirectory($src, $dst, $options = [])\n{\n    if ($src === $dst || strpos($dst, $src) !== false){\n        throw new \\Exception( \"Trying to copy a directory to itself or a subdirectory.\" );\n    }\n\n   ...\n}\n```\n\nCan I make a pull request with that fix?\n\nP.S. The Unix `cp`command has that \"problem\" as well.\nP.S.S. In a funny coincidence, I read [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/41l7qn/tifu_by_accidentally_creating_33_million_folders/) today.\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
