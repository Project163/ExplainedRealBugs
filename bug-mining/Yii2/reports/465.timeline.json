you suggest,I create table cache:\r\n```php\r\n      CREATE TABLE cache (\r\n          id char(128) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\r\n          expire int(11),\r\n          data BLOB\r\n      );\r\n```\r\nbecause the id field  is primary key,that is the problem:\r\n**Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry 'key' for key 'PRIMARY'** \r\n\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n//first time call\r\n$cache->set('key','some data');\r\n//the second call\r\n$cache->set('key','some data');\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nnull\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nI find DbCache php file, change that setValue() method,add a line below:\r\n```php\r\nprotected function setValue($key, $value, $duration)\r\n    {\r\n        $command = $this->db->createCommand()\r\n            ->update($this->cacheTable, [\r\n                'expire' => $duration > 0 ? $duration + time() : 0,\r\n                'data' => [$value, \\PDO::PARAM_LOB],\r\n            ], ['id' => $key]);\r\n        if ($command->execute()) {\r\n            $this->gc();\r\n            return true;\r\n        } else {\r\n\t\t/*======add this line===========*/\r\n\t\t$this->deleteValue($key);//before addValue,delete the  duplicate key if any.\r\n\t\t/*========================*/**\r\n            return $this->addValue($key, $value, $duration);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nthat is the revolution。\r\n### Additional info\r\n Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry 'key' for key 'PRIMARY' \r\nwhen I use FileCache,it won't throw exception,and It will refresh the data every call set method。\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | `2.0.11.2`\r\n| PHP version      | 7.0\r\n|
