have a bug here with Yii2 2.0.6 and our PostgreSQL database. When a column is set with `DEFAULT NULL`, Yii2 puts a string `NULL` (NULL written as a text) in the attribute after we call `$model->loadDefaultValues()`.\n\nExample:\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE \"test\"\n(\n    \"id\" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    \"name\" varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL\n);\n```\n\nand\n\n``` php\n$model = new Test;\n$model->loadDefaultValues();\nvar_dump($model->name);\n```\n\nThe output is\n\n`string(4) \"NULL\"`\n\nThe expected output would be\n\n`NULL`\n\n<br>\nI believe the problem is in yii\\db\\pgsql\\Schema:\n\n``` php\nprotected function findColumns($table)\n{\n    ...\n    foreach ($columns as $column) {\n        ...\n        if ($column->isPrimaryKey) {\n            ...\n        } elseif ($column->defaultValue) {\n            if ($column->type === 'timestamp' && $column->defaultValue === 'now()') {\n                ...\n            } elseif ($column->type === 'boolean') {\n                ...\n            } elseif (stripos($column->dbType, 'bit') === 0 || stripos($column->dbType, 'varbit') === 0) {\n                ...\n            } elseif (preg_match(\"/^'(.*?)'::/\", $column->defaultValue, $matches)) {\n                ...\n            } elseif (preg_match(\"/^(.*?)::/\", $column->defaultValue, $matches)) {\n                $column->defaultValue = $column->phpTypecast($matches[1]);\n            } else {\n                ...\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nIn our case, the value of `$column->defaultValue` comes as a string `NULL::character varying`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
