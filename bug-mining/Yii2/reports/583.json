This property is managed by [[log()]] and [[flush()]].\r\n     * Each log message is of the following structure:\r\n     *\r\n     * ```\r\n     * [\r\n     *   [0] => message (mixed, can be a string or some complex data, such as an exception object)\r\n     *   [1] => level (integer)\r\n     *   [2] => category (string)\r\n     *   [3] => timestamp (float, obtained by microtime(true))\r\n     *   [4] => traces (array, debug backtrace, contains the application code call stacks)\r\n     *   [5] => memory usage in bytes (int, obtained by memory_get_usage()), available since version 2.0.11.\r\n     * ]\r\n     * ```\r\n     */\r\n    public $messages = [];\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever in `Target::collect()` a context message is appended:\r\n```php\r\n...\r\n    if (($context = $this->getContextMessage()) !== '') {\r\n        $this->messages[] = [$context, Logger::LEVEL_INFO, 'application', YII_BEGIN_TIME];\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nAll messages passed to `export()` should have a proper format. (array of length 6)\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nThe first message has length 4.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nI propose adding the missing 2 elements.","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16565/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16565/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
