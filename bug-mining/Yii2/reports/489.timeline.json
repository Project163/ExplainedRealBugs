wont work @tarranjones because if user doesn't submit the `version` number the script will load the value as stored in database which will bring back issue #9133.\r\n\r\nThe point of this behavior is to ensure **data is only updated/deleted if user submits a version number**. For the other tasks unrelated to handling user inputs, this behavior should not be attached. In such cases, I'd suggest extending the model class or create a different one to use internally. A parent class that only overrides `optimisticLock()` should safely throw `StaleObjectException` if the model gets updated by others on that bit of time between loading it from DB and saving it back.\r\n\r\nAlso, for any other different/custom cases, developers can always override that function on setup:\r\n```php\r\npublic function behaviors()\r\n{\r\n    return [\r\n        OptimisticLockBehavior::className(),\r\n        'value' => function ($event) {\r\n            // do your logic here and return some value\r\n        },\r\n
