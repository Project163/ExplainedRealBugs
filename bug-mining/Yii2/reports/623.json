What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nWhen trying to build something like `WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM x) = 0` using the query builders, the serialised object is added to the final query:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$subquery = (new Query())\r\n               ->select(['COUNT(*)'])\r\n               ->from('DOCUMENT_FILE_VERSIONS dv2')\r\n               ->where('dv2.ID_DOCUMENT_FILE = dv.ID_DOCUMENT_FILE AND dv2.VERSION_NUMBER > dv.VERSION_NUMBER');\r\n$query = (new Query())\r\n            ->select(['dv.ID'])\r\n            ->from('DOCUMENT_FILE_VERSIONS dv')\r\n            ->where(new SimpleCondition($subquery, '=', 0))\r\n            ->limit(10);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nSubquery object is properly added to `WHERE` clause.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n```\r\nException: SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: number of bound variables does not match number of tokens\r\nThe SQL being executed was: SELECT `dv`.`ID` [....]\r\nWHERE O:12:\"yii\\db\\Query\":20:{s:6:\"select\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"COUNT(*)\";}s:12:\"selectOption\";N;s:8:\"distinct\";N;s:4:\"from\";a:1:{i:0;s:26:\"DOCUMENT_FILE_VERSIONS

Proposed solutions\r\nEither `Query::__toString()` should be smarter and return an SQL string (like `Expression` does, but I don't know what implications this has) or we adapt `SimpleConditionBuilder` to accept `ExpressionInterface` as $column (I can prepare a quick PR for that). This allows one to specify this as array format too:\r\n```\r\n$query = (new Query())\r\n            ->select(['dv.ID'])\r\n            ->from('DOCUMENT_FILE_VERSIONS dv')\r\n            ->where(['=', $max_version_subquery, 0])\r\n            ->limit(10);\r\n```\r\nCheers,\r\nR","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17549/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
