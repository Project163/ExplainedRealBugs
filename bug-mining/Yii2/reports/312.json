It doesn't save data to cache only if `$cache` is null. But in this code\r\n```\r\n    $cache = null;\r\n        if ($this->db->enableSchemaCache && !in_array($name, $this->db->schemaCacheExclude, true)) {\r\n            $schemaCache = is_string($this->db->schemaCache) ? Yii::$app->get($this->db->schemaCache, false) : $this->db->schemaCache;\r\n            if ($schemaCache instanceof Cache) {\r\n                $cache = $schemaCache;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nwe see that `$cache` is not null just if `enableSchemaCache` is set and particular schemaCache is not excluded.\r\nIn previous frameworrk version data was saved to cache only if it wasn't in cache or if it's `$refresh`. In current version even after `$this->loadTableMetadataFromCache($cache, $name);` we save cache.\r\n\r\nI don't understand actually why it's so slow, but if I save metadata to cache once and then comment line `$this->saveTableMetadataToCache($cache, $name);` then it works fast and takes data from cache\r\n\r\nI would move `$this->saveTableMetadataToCache($cache, $name);` into `if (!array_key_exists($type, $this->_tableMetadata[$name])) {` to lok like this\r\n```\r\n        if (!array_key_exists($type, $this->_tableMetadata[$name])) {\r\n            $this->_tableMetadata[$name][$type] = $this->{'loadTable' . ucfirst($type)}($this->getRawTableName($name));\r\n            $this->saveTableMetadataToCache($cache, $name);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/14435\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.12\r\n| PHP version      | 7.0.18\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14434/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
