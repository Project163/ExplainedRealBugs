What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nHi,\r\nI've `department` and `college` table with this structure :\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->createTable('department', [\r\n            'id' => $this->primaryKey(),\r\n            'code' => $this->string()->notNull(),\r\n            'collegeId' => $this->integer()->notNull(),\r\n            'createdAt' => $this->integer(),\r\n            'updatedAt' => $this->integer(),\r\n        ]);\r\n\r\n$this->createTable('department_info', [\r\n       'id' => $this->primaryKey(),\r\n       'name' => $this->string(),\r\n       'languageId' => $this->string(),\r\n       'description' => $this->text(),\r\n      'departmentId' => $this->integer()->notNull(),\r\n ]);\r\n\r\n$this->createTable('college', [\r\n            'id' => $this->primaryKey(),\r\n            'code' => $this->string()->notNull(),\r\n            'createdAt' => $this->integer(),\r\n            'updatedAt' => $this->integer(),\r\n        ]);\r\n\r\n$this->createTable('college_info', [\r\n            'id' => $this->primaryKey(),\r\n            'name' => $this->string(),\r\n            'languageId' => $this->string(),\r\n            'description' => $this->text(),\r\n            'collegeId' => $this->integer()->notNull(),\r\n            'websiteId' => $this->integer(),\r\n            'url' => $this->text(),\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nin rules of Department model `code` attribute is unique :\r\n\r\n```php\r\n public function rules()\r\n    {\r\n        return [\r\n            [['code', 'collegeId'], 'required'],\r\n            [['code'], 'unique'],\r\n            [['code'], 'integer'],\r\n        ];\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nthen this model use uniqueValidator.\r\nIn special condition in `Department::find()` method i'm trying to join that tables :\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic static function find()\r\n    {\r\n        $query = new ActiveQuery(get_called_class());\r\n        if(Yii::$app->user->isSuperuser()){\r\n            return $query;\r\n        }\r\n        $query->joinWith('college');\r\n        return $query;\r\n    } \r\n```\r\nwhile update one record of department this error was occured :\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1052 Column 'id' in field list is ambiguous\r\nThe SQL being executed was:\r\n SELECT `id` FROM `department` LEFT JOIN `college` ON `department`.`collegeId` = `college`.`id` WHERE (`code`='1') LIMIT 2\r\n```\r\n3 month ago i wrote #13704 issue and some changes in master branch was occured but seems uniqueValidator already has some problems.\r\n\r\nin `UniqueValidator::modelExists($targetClass, $conditions, $model)` \r\nin this part :\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif ($query instanceof \\yii\\db\\ActiveQuery) {\r\n                // only select primary key to optimize query\r\n                $query->select($targetClass::primaryKey());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nwhen die($query->createCommand()->getSql()) return this :\r\n`'SELECT `id` FROM `department` LEFT JOIN `college` ON `department`.`collegeId` = `college`.`id` WHERE (`code`=:qp0)'`\r\n\r\nbut while commented  `$query->select($targetClass::primaryKey());` line return this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT `department`.* FROM `department` LEFT JOIN `college` ON `department`.`collegeId` = `college`.`id` WHERE (`code`=:qp0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand i need this.\r\nit seems with commented that line problem will solved.\r\nother solution is adding tableName as prefix to `id` column.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14042/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
