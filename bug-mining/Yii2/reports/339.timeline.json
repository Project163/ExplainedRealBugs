I could've been clearer. Poor wording by me.\r\n\r\nOne another idea is instead of an option, we could quiet the output if `YII_DEBUG` is not turned on. I think most of the time, in production, migration logs are less relevant. I think that might be better, but that's likely a BC break and therefore less ideal. \r\n\r\nI think we can implement a `$quiet` property on the migration controller, that is configurable via the application config, as well as CLI args. I'll have to dig around in the source later to see where I'd make changes.

was looking through the code to see how I would implement this. This is what I'm thinking:\r\n\r\n - Add a `$quiet` property to `yii\\db\\Migration`, to be set via `yii\\console\\controllers\\BaseMigrateController` in the `createMigration` function.\r\n- Add the CLI argument for `-q` or `--quiet`, set as a property on BaseMigrateController to get propogated down to the `yii\\db\\Migration` instances.\r\n- Every function in `yii\\db\\Migration` has two echos. I'd like to pull those out into protected functions to remove some duplication. I'm thinking calling them `echoStart($string)` and `echoDone($time)`\r\n  - `echoStart` would just be `echo \"    > $string ...\";`, but also wrapped with a check if `$this->quiet !== null`.\r\n  - `echoDone` would be `echo ' done (time: ' . sprintf('%.3f', microtime(true) - $time) . \"s)\\n\";` similarly wrapped with the check for quiet.\r\n\r\n`migrateUp` and such in `BaseMigrateController` already do the work of printing out which class is being run and the time elapsed, so there's still that information visible.\r\n\r\nMaybe we want to modify the output from `BaseMigrateController` to put each class migrated on one line each if `$quiet` is on? I think it would clean up the output, as each class takes up 3 lines currently (the first line at the start, then the line when it's done, plus an extra newline for spacing). I'm thinking we can do the same `echo` abstraction into helper functions as I proposed above for `yii\\db\\Migration` to clean that up.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? I can get started on a PR, I just want to make sure I'm not planning on doing something that doesn't make sense.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/315619537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"francislavoie","id":2111701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2111701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie","html_url":"https://github.com/francislavoie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francislavoie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/315636002","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13853#issuecomment-315636002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13853","id":315636002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTYzNjAwMg==","user":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-16T20:48:49Z","updated_at":"2017-07-16T20:48:49Z","body":"first part sounds good to me, I'd use a different name for the methods, `beginCommand()` and `endCommand()` could be used they do not only echo but also track the time.\r\n\r\nNot sure about changing MigrateController output to one line because quite will only affect output printed by migration methods, while one could have own echo output in a migration that does not respect the $quiet property.
