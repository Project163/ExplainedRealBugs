So i think the `user` property in RateLimiter is useless.\r\n\r\nThe only solution i came up to solve my problem and also make `user` work is another check for a user service, similar to what is done when no user is specified (https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/filters/RateLimiter.php#L84).\r\n\r\nSolution to make `'user' => 'partnerUser'` work:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// if the user is defined as service name\r\nif (!is_object($this->user)) { \r\n    $this->user = Instance::ensure($this->user)->getIdentity();\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/filters/RateLimiter.php#L86\r\n\r\nIf this is an acceptable solution, i would do a PR. If there is another solution for my problem with custom user components let me know.\r\n\r\n**update**:\r\n\r\nAnother proposed solution might be to accept closures:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif ($this->user instanceof Closure) {\r\n    $this->user = call_user_func($this->user);\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
