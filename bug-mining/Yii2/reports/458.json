db engine saves simple column types with null php value as SQL NULL (field 'x' in example), but for json type it saves them only as null::json, which is correct json of course, but would not it be nice to have control about saving it as SQL NULL if needed?\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n **PostgreSql 9.6**\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table somedata \r\n(\r\n        id integer not null primary key,\r\n\tx integer,\r\n\ty json\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n        $db = \\Yii::$app->db;\r\n        // 1) y -> sql NULL\r\n        $db->createCommand('INSERT INTO {{somedata}} VALUES(1, null, null)')->execute();\r\n        // 2)\t!!!!!\t\r\n        $db->createCommand()->insert('{{somedata}}', [\r\n            'id' => 2,\r\n            'x' => null,\r\n            'y' => null,\r\n        ])->execute();        \r\n        // 3) for ActiveRecord\r\n        $obj = new Somedata();\r\n        $obj->id = 3;\r\n        $obj->x = 1;\r\n        $obj->y = ['x' => 'y'];\r\n        $obj->save();\r\n        // 4)  !!!!!\r\n        $obj2 = new Somedata();\r\n        $obj2->id = 4;\r\n        $obj2->x = null;\r\n        $obj2->y = null;\r\n        $obj2->save();\r\n```\r\n\r\n`select id, x , y , json_typeof(y) as y_jsontype, y is NULL as y_isnull from somedata;`\r\n### What do you get ?\r\n```\r\n id | x |     y     | y_jsontype | y_isnull\r\n----+---+-----------+------------+----------\r\n  1 |   |           |            | t\r\n  2 |   | null      | null       | f\r\n  3 | 1 | {\"x\":\"y\"} | object     | f\r\n  4 |   | null      | null       | f\r\n```\r\nAs you see in cases 2) and 4) saves as null::json\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.14.1\r\n|
