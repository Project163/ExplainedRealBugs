It claims that if I specify a default for some parameter, I would be able to create URLs using this rule and omitting the parameter. Well, that doesn't work.\n\nRule configuration:\n\n``` php\n[\n     'pattern' => 'post/<id:\\d+>/<slug>',\n     'route' => 'post/view',\n     'defaults' => ['slug' => ''],\n]\n```\n\nI want to be able to create URLs without the slug. So I expect the following call\n\n``` php\nUrl::to(['post/view', 'id' => 100]);\n```\n\nto generate URL `/post/view/100`. Instead it skips the rule and creates the regular URL `/post/view?id=100`.\n\nLooking at the framework code, there's a part that  puzzles me in `UrlRule` class:\n\n``` php\n// match default params\n// if a default param is not in the route pattern, its value must also be matched\nforeach ($this->defaults as $name => $value) {\n// ...\n    if (!isset($params[$name])) {\n        return false;\n    } // ...\n}\n```\n\nSo it clearly reads that if a parameter is mentioned in defaults section (such as `slug` in my case), and the value for this parameter is not provided when creating URL, then skip the rule. That contradicts what I read in the documentation.\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/10970/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
