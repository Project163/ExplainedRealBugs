it was added in  9e66e08  (#802) not sure why. seems accidentally added.\n\nJudging by that diff you might as well say that\n\n``` PHP\n } else {  \n    return $default;  \n}\n```\n\nwas added accidentally at the end of `getValue()` function. Notice how original version of `getValue()` from that diff while not throwing exception would still error out (with PHP error) when first argument is neither array nor object.\n\nCurrently, `getValue()` is documented as follows:\n\n``` PHP\n@param array|object $array array or object to extract value from\n```\n\nWhen doing coding according to documentation, you cannot call `getValue(123, 'test', 'default')` and expect it to return 'default'.\n\nDocumentation aside, I highly doubt that in existing code like:\n\n``` PHP\ngetValue($somevar, 'test', 'default');\n```\n\nthe author of the code actually EXPECTED to get `'default'` when `$somevar` is null, integer or alike. I highly doubt that in existing places using `getValue()` it would make any sense for the first argument to be anything other than array or object. Again, IMO it is better to error out saying \"hey, look, $array is invalid so there might be something wrong in the code where the value of $array has originated from\" rather than silently ignoring the problem as if nothing happened.\n\nAs for the BC breaking. First, it is yet has to be proven that any code in Yii relies on `getValue(123, 'test', 'default')` returning 'default' (and even if there is such code it should be analyzed and fixed accordingly). Second, if the user code relied on such behavior of `getValue()` it was written in violation of `getValue()` documentation and you cannot talk about backwards compatibility with such code.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/259460399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PowerGamer1","id":8275897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzU4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8275897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1","html_url":"https://github.com/PowerGamer1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PowerGamer1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":853438138,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ4NTM0MzgxMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/853438138","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-09T19:07:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":853438717,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDg1MzQzODcxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/853438717","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-09T19:08:05Z","label":{"name":"status:to

However this allows weird things like:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$array = [];\r\ngetValue($array, 'test.name', ['name' => 'hi']); // returns \"hi\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this should be refactored and tested better in 2.1.\r\n\r\nI'd add an exception for now.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/267487798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":896097401,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg5NjA5NzQwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/896097401","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e963b2af6486dd79c26a460148c63efb580f53fc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/commits/e963b2af6486dd79c26a460148c63efb580f53fc","created_at":"2016-12-16T00:50:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-16T00:51:35Z","updated_at":"2016-12-16T00:51:35Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13216","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13216/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13216/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/13216/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/13216","id":195955539,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0OTgyNjA1MzY=","number":13216,"title":"fix
