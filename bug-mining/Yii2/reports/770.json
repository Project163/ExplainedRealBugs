Ensure that `AssetManager::$appendTimestamp` is `true`.\r\n2. Register an asset bundle whose `$baseUrl` is set to an absolute URL (starting with `http`/`https`) or an alias that will result in an absolute URL. (It’s important that the URL is not root-relative (starting with `/`).)\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nResulting JS/CSS URLs get timestamps appended (`?v=XXXXXX`).\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nNo timestamp.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nLooks like this bug was introduced by 7ff516063de41a9f75ee7ac01c5c7c364e5b10d4.\r\n\r\nAssetBundle::registerAssetFiles() now calls `$manager->getActualAssetUrl()` instead of `getAssetUrl()`, but the timestamp was being appended from `getAssetUrl()`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/ea8fe8dcc1ddff5cf0155860ada50c7feb40401d/framework/web/AssetBundle.php#L156-L159\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.40\r\n| PHP version      | n/a\r\n| Operating system | n/a\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
