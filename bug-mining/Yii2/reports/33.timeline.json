js\nif (this.validate) {\n    // This is the client side validation.\n    this.validate(this, getValue($form, this), msg, deferreds, $form);\n}\nif (this.enableAjaxValidation) {\n    // This will

AJAX validation.\n} else {\n    // This displays client side validation messages.\n    updateInputs($form, messages, submitting);\n}\n```\n\nSo client side validation is performed if it's enabled but the result is never used if AJAX validation is enabled as well. While this logic isn't quite straight forward, I don't see a simple yet consistent way to combine client and ajax validation, mainly because of the possibility to display more than one error message for an attribute. It could be done this way:\n\n``` js\nif (this.validate) {\n    this.validate(this, getValue($form, this), msg, deferreds, $form);\n}\nif (msg.length === 0 && this.enableAjaxValidation) {\n    needAjaxValidation = true;\n}\n```\n\nbut if we want to display multiple validation errors for an attribute (`\\yii\\validators\\Validator::$skipOnError` is set to false) it becomes quite non-trivial to determine whether to continue with AJAX validation after client side validation or not, as well as to combine client side validation error messages with AJAX validation ones.\n\nAnother possible solution is to restrict one-way validation to avoid the confusion. This one won't break current behavior:\n\n``` js\nif (this.enableAjaxValidation) {\n    needAjaxValidation = true;\n}\nelse if (this.validate) {\n    this.validate(this, getValue($form, this), msg, deferreds, $form);\n}\n```\n\nEither way it should be explicitly documented.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/205246987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aleskiontherun","id":845698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/845698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun","html_url":"https://github.com/aleskiontherun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleskiontherun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":617445952,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NjE3NDQ1OTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/617445952","actor":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"e5bcbf4e1ded7f56f71eb38105b3ea48280fa504","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/commits/e5bcbf4e1ded7f56f71eb38105b3ea48280fa504","created_at":"2016-04-06T20:54:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":617446224,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDYxNzQ0NjIyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/617446224","actor":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-06T20:54:17Z","label":{"name":"type:bug","color":"e102d8"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":617446225,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NjE3NDQ2MjI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/617446225","actor":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User",

What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nMy model:\r\n```php\r\nclass SignupForm extends \\yii\\base\\Model\r\n{\r\n    public $email;\r\n    public $password;\r\n\r\n    public function rules()\r\n

result?\r\nValidate all supported client validations before sending ajax validation request\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nClient validation work correctly on input blur, change event, but send ajax request on submitting although all fields are empty.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.12\r\n| PHP version      |
