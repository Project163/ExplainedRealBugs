 **frontend\\models\\SignupForm::signup()**\r\nIn the section describing assigning default roles at sign up, I suggest fixing the docs so the code works:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$auth = Yii::$app->authManager;\r\n``` \r\nshould be \r\n```php\r\n$auth = \\Yii::$app->authManager;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr add the following code to **frontend\\models\\SignupForm::signup()** by default\r\n```php\r\nuse Yii;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n- Install Advanced app\r\n- configure the database, \r\n- run the migration to create the \"user\"  table\r\n\r\nFollow:  \r\nhttp://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-security-authorization.html\r\n```php\r\n        'authManager' => [\r\n        \t'class' => 'yii\\rbac\\DbManager',\r\n

\r\n``` \r\nyii rbac/init\r\n```\r\n- Modify frontend\\models\\SignupForm::signup() as described in the Guide\r\n- Now sign up a new user.
