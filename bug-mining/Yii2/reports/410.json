current order is thead, tfoot, tbody (as it was used to be done) in the GridView table element, but the new HTML 5.1 recommendation changes this: https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/tabular-data.html#tabular-data: \" [...] followed optionally by a thead element, followed by either zero or more tbody elements or one or more tr elements, followed optionally by a tfoot element [...] \".\r\nThis change would also produce nicer mouse selection behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe fix would be very simple, one would have to swap two lines in yii2\\grid\\GridView.php, in the function renderItems().\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nCreate a GridView with 'showFooter' => true and with some data.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nIn the DOM tree, the order of the table children should be: thead, tbody, tfoot. (Of course with colgroup/caption etc if set).\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nThe tfoot element comes before tbody. This also changes the order of selected elements (try selecting the table content with the mouse and copy-pasting it into Excel, the footer will come as the second row).\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.12\r\n| PHP version      | 7.1.1\r\n| Operating system | Windows 7\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14806/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
