Yii cannot use types in method signature due to supported PHP versions range, but it does not mean we should add guards for every possible misuse of any method in framework. If phpdoc does not allow to pass `null` as `$key`, then it is on you if you decide to ignore it and pass `null` anyway.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/1256412891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rob006","id":5972388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzIzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006","html_url":"https://github.com/rob006","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7453948587,"node_id":"CE_lADOADRbGc5SQOKizwAAAAG8Sjqr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/7453948587","actor":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b61b9ac25338a97321a31f50c43ba49b15f23642","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/commits/b61b9ac25338a97321a31f50c43ba49b15f23642","created_at":"2022-09-25T19:48:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7453948600,"node_id":"CE_lADOADRbGc5SQOKizwAAAAG8Sjq4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/7453948600","actor":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-25T19:48:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/1257266203","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19589#issuecomment-1257266203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19589","id":1257266203,"node_id":"IC_kwDOADRbGc5K8Fwb","user":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-25T19:48:58Z","updated_at":"2022-09-25T19:48:58Z","bod

That is the point why PHP started to emit deprecation for such cases. By adding bling guards Yii negates progress made by PHP. And if we're fine with that and decide that `null` is valid key, it should be reflected by phpdoc and probably fixed in `keyExists()` too.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/comments/1257275660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rob006","id":5972388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzIzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006","html_url":"https://github.com/rob006","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob006/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11636940063,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADRbGc5SQOKizwAAAAK1nZ0f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/11636940063","actor":{"login":"maxodrom","id":11097695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11097695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom","html_url":"https://github.com/maxodrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxodrom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b61b9ac25338a97321a31f50c43ba49b15f23642","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/maxodrom/yii2/commits/b61b9ac25338a97321a31f50c43ba49b15f23642","created_at":"2024-01-30T06:20:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
