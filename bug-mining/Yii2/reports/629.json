Load balancer replaces *X-Forwarded-For* with user real IP (50.0.0.1) and appends own IP (30.0.0.1). It also sets *X-Forwarded-Proto*, so final headers look like:\r\n    ~~~\r\n    REMOTE_ADDR: 50.0.0.1\r\n    X-Forwarded-For: 50.0.0.1,30.0.0.1\r\n    X-Forwarded-Proto: https\r\n    ~~~\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nHeaders should be trusted and `getIsSecureConnection()` should return `true`.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nHeaders are not trusted, because [filterHeaders](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/web/Request.php#L300) uses `getRemoteIP` instead of `getUserIP`.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.23\r\n| PHP version      | PHP 7.3.8\r\n| Operating system | Arch Linux x64 5.2.9-arch1-1-ARCH\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17521/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
