So rephrasing your question: should I use `Action` instance in case I wish to change `Controller::$enableCsrfValidation` property?\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely someone to set `Controller::$enableCsrfValidation` inside the view file as it make a little sense - it will not affect request processing, which is complete at this stage.\r\n\r\nAdjustments of the layout as well as page title (which appears only in the layout file by the way) still will have effect on the page rendering - it is the matter of representation layer, thus it is fine to be kept inside the representation file.\r\n\r\nYour ignorance is not an excuse for creating redundant shortcut
