working on a fix, I noted this:\r\nhttps://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blame/master/tests/framework/base/SecurityTest.php#L1287\r\n\r\n@cebe Are you of the opinion that masking an empty string should always result in an exception?\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution without changing the Security component, would be to regenerate the CSRF token:\r\n````\r\npublic function getCsrfToken($regenerate = false)\r\n    {\r\n        if ($this->_csrfToken === null || $regenerate) {\r\n            if ($regenerate || ($token = $this->loadCsrfToken()) === null) {\r\n                $token =

}\r\n````\r\nInstead of only checking for `=== null` we could check for `empty()` and regenerate?\r\n\r\n\r\nInterestingly, unmasking the empty string does work..\r\nWhich means that the range of `maskToken()` is not equal to the domain of `unmaskToken()`, which is not intuitive for a function that is the inverse of another
