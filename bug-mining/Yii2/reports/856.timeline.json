Two cents,\r\n\r\nFirstly kudos for wintersilence for working on optimisations, this is always a great thing and shows the base is moving forward. Its just in this case some unintended consequences have been hit. If we look at the attributes() function description, it states...\r\n\r\n     * Returns the list of attribute names.\r\n     *\r\n     * By default, this method returns all public non-static properties of the class.\r\n     * You may override this method to change the default behavior.\r\n     \r\nNotice the word \"all\".\r\n\r\nNow with the new code we are moving from using Reflections which I agree with wintersilence is historically something one wants to move away from (although one could argue nowadays its prob been optimized so much its not so bad). To using Yii getObjectVars()  which uses PHP core get_object_vars() and this function states....\r\n\r\n     * @return array an associative array of defined object accessible non-static properties\r\n     * for the specified <i>object</i> in scope. If a property have\r\n     * not been assigned a value, it will be returned with a null value.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI suspect the line we are interested in is _\"If a property have not been assigned a value... it will be returned with a null value\"_\r\n\r\nThis is me just doing a quick 5 min look, so could be very wrong :-) But if right then need to either \r\n* change the comment in the attributes() function by removing \"all\" and stating \"properties that have been assigned a value\"\r\n* update Yii getObjectVars() with say a flag indicating give me all object vars including ones that dont have a value.\r\n* or just revert but add a comment in the attributes function saying this can be optimised at a later stage?\r\n\r\nAs this is probably being used in thousands of installations I think best to revert. Again my two cents
