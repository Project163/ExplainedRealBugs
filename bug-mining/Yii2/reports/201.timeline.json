You can set me as assignee. Currently I wrote full tests suite for `yii.validation.js`. It's based on Mocha, Chai, Sinon and Leche. Will open PR soon so we can move from dead point and discuss further with existing code.\n\nAs for `yii.validation.js` - there are almost no DOM manipulations. Currently tests are adapted to run only in browser, but I'm going to swap it with Node / Phantom to run from command line.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n> should we use nodejs + jsdom or phantom?\n\nNot sure about this at the moment.\n\n> should we use Mocha?\n\nI think we should. I investigated this problem before writing tests, have read some articles. Mocha seems to be good choice, but QUnit and Jasmine are reliable too. Personally I'm for Mocha.\n\n> should we start with ES5 | Typescript | javascript\n\nI think we need to use regular JavaScript (ES5 based) since the testable code is written in it too.

Q             | A\r\n| ------------- | ---\r\n| Is bugfix?    | yes, it contains some bug fixes\r\n| New feature?  | no\r\n| Breaks BC?    | no\r\n| Tests pass?   | yes\r\n| Fixed issues  | #12840\r\n\r\nUsed @nkovacs draft as starting point(https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11037#issuecomment-193356450). I also fixed some bugs in `yii.validation.js` and did some refactoring.\r\n\r\n## Implemented tests\r\n\r\n- yii.validation.js\r\n\r\n## Running tests\r\n\r\n- JS tests use jQuery and Punycode.js libraries from `vendor/bower` to match those that are used in assets and prevent installing and synchronizing duplicates via NPM. So make sure you have them installed. If no - run `composer install` to install them via Composer Asset Plugin.\r\n- Install Node.js. I used the latest version available at the moment - `v7.1.0`. Note that used `jsdom` dependent library version requires `Node.js >= 4`.\r\n- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.\r\n- Execute `npm test` for running tests.\r\n\r\n## Problems list\r\n\r\n- [x] Sinon can not be installed via Composer Asset Plugin. If I add line `\"npm-asset/sinon\": \"^1.17.6\"` to `required-dev` section of `composer.json` and run `composer update` I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[RuntimeException]\r\nFailed to execute git clone --mirror 'git+ssh://git@github.com/sinonjs/sinon.git' '/home/vagrant/.composer/cache/vcs/git-ssh---git-github.com-sinonjs-sinon.git/'\r\nCloning into bare repository '/home/vagrant/.composer/cache/vcs/git-ssh---git-github.com-sinonjs-sinon.git'...\r\nPermission denied (publickey).\r\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\r\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPossibly related: https://github.com/fxpio/composer-asset-plugin/issues/187.\r\n\r\nI tried `--prefer-dist` option, that didn't help. I also have generated SSH key and it's added it to `ssh-agent` (error is mentioned in [git-workflow](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/internals/git-workflow.md#1-fork-the-yii-repository-on-github-and-clone-your-fork-to-your-development-environment) document which is a part of internal docs).\r\n\r\nThis is not actual anymore because Node.js and NPM are used for testing.\r\n\r\n- [x] Sometimes \"image validator with FileReader API is not available\" test takes a long time to load and gives warning with time written inside of a red label. This is because of swapping native `FileReader`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar initialFileReader = FileReader;\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(function () {\r\n    FileReader = undefined;\r\n});\r\n\r\nafterEach(function () {\r\n    FileReader = initialFileReader;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut:\r\n\r\n- It happens pretty seldom and increases time by about half of second only.\r\n- I can't see a better solution for testing this, so this is not a big problem.\r\n- Similar technique is used for swapping native JS components in other places.\r\n\r\nSo this is not a big deal.\r\n\r\nThis is not actual anymore because Node.js and NPM are used for testing and for testing that case different approach is used.\r\n\r\n- [x] Run tests in command line instead of a browser.\r\n\r\nNode.js and NPM are used for testing.\r\n\r\n- [x] Error while running `npm test`:\r\n\r\n> Error: timeout of 15000ms exceeded. Ensure the done() callback is being called in this test.\r\n\r\nHappens very seldom, this is because of jsdom and integrating jQuery. Default timeout is 2000ms. And this is always not enough, so I increased it to be 15000ms.\r\n\r\nSolved with increasing timeout to 30s, see #13160.\r\n\r\n- [x] In build detailed info the line after \"with width more than minimum width\" (validateImage method, with successfully read image) is not printed. It's OK locally though.\r\n\r\nCan't see it in some builds, maybe it was Travis glitch related with formatting.\r\n\r\nIt's gone in the latest builds, for example in [this one](https://travis-ci.org/yiisoft/yii2/jobs/182190268).\r\n\r\n## Integration with Travis CI\r\n\r\nI found this [article](https://ma27.github.io/travis-ci/2016/05/06/travis-for-nodejs-and-php.html) and used it as starting point.\r\n\r\n> TravisCI uses the software which is shipped by default on a `precise`: An ancient setup with NodeJS 0.10 and NPM 1.x. The current 3.x series of NPM is much more stable than the ancient NPM 1.x and fixed a lot of misbehavior which has been implemented in the older versions of NPM. Especially code which has been written for the browser will experience issues due to some implementation details of NPM releases prior to the 3.x series.\r\n\r\nWe can't use Node.js < 4 because of [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) dependency. I refused to use [3.x branch](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/tree/3.x) of jsdom because it's considered legacy and no longer maintained.\r\n\r\nI tried to change dist to `trusty` and install newer versions of Node.js and NPM. It worked, but another error appeared during creating test MySQL database:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- mysql -e 'CREATE DATABASE yiitest;';\r\n```\r\n\r\nError's text:\r\n\r\n> ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)\r\n\r\nThen I found https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6842 and fixed it with installation of MySQL 5.6 (default is MySQL 5.5 for trusty dist).\r\n\r\nHovewer new problems appeared.\r\n\r\n- [x] On PHP 5.4:\r\n\r\n> Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library\r\n> '/home/travis/.phpenv/versions/5.4.45/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-zts-20100525/apc.so' -\r\n> /home/travis/.phpenv/versions/5.4.45/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-zts-20100525/apc.so:\r\n> cannot open shared object file: \r\n> No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6853\r\n\r\nI'm trying to fix it by installing PECL package, see this [article](http://olvlvl.com/2016-09-travis-apc). Hovewer no results yet, because it tries to install it for PHP 7 version (that's weird because version in the build is 5.4).\r\n\r\nFixed.\r\n\r\n- [x] On HHVM 2 tests related with PostgreSQL are now failing.\r\n\r\nSpecified 3.6 version for testing (the same as on Precise), created separate issues - #12981, #12982.\r\n\r\n- [x] Get rid of oauth token, #12987.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12936/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12936/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"arogachev","id":8326201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjYyMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev","html_url":"https://github.com/arogachev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-08T13:01:49Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T13:01:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12943","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12943/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12943/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12943/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12943","id":187986049,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODc5ODYwNDk=","number":12943,"title":"Use

working on #12840 I discovered [autoload-dev](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload-dev) section of Composer.\r\n\r\n> `autoload-dev` (root-only)#\r\n>\r\n> This section allows to define autoload rules for development purposes.\r\n>\r\n> Classes needed to run the test suite should not be included in the main autoload rules to avoid polluting the autoloader in production and when other people use your package as a dependency.\r\n>\r\n> Therefore, it is a good idea to rely on a dedicated path for your unit tests and to add it within the `autoload-dev` section.\r\n>\r\n> Example:\r\n>\r\n> ```json\r\n> {\r\n>     \"autoload\": {\r\n>         \"psr-4\": { \"MyLibrary\\\\\": \"src/\" }\r\n>     },\r\n>     \"autoload-dev\": {\r\n>         \"psr-4\": { \"MyLibrary\\\\Tests\\\\\": \"tests/\" }\r\n>     }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nWe can add this to `composer.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"autoload-dev\": {\r\n    \"psr-4\": {\r\n        \"yiiunit\\\\\": \"tests/\"\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nand run `composer dump-autoload`.\r\n\r\nThen this line in `tests/bootstrap.php` will become unnecessary:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nYii::setAlias('@yiiunit', __DIR__);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso want to ask about this block:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// require composer autoloader if available\r\n$composerAutoload = __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';\r\nif (is_file($composerAutoload)) {\r\n    require_once($composerAutoload);\r\n} else {\r\n    require_once(__DIR__ . '/../../../autoload.php');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Running `composer update` is a required condition in [Prepare testing environment](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/internals/git-workflow.md#3-prepare-the-testing-environment-) section of [Git workflow for Yii 2 contributors](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/internals/git-workflow.md).\r\n- I think Composer is used in Travis too,\r\n\r\nSo is this check really needed?\r\n\r\nNote that to ignore `autoload-dev` section on production, we need to use `--no-dev` flag (found it not in official docs, but in this [blog article](https://hannesvdvreken.com/2015/01/28/autoload-dev/)). We can cover this in docs.\r\n\r\nFor example in [Deployer](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer) deploy tool it's already considered in [common recipe](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/common.php):\r\n\r\n```php\r\nset('composer_options', '{{composer_action}} --verbose --prefer-dist --no-progress --no-interaction --no-dev --optimize-autoloader');\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/composer.json) already uses it for tests.\r\n\r\nSo seems like this is a recommended way of handling autoloading in test environment in case of using Composer (and we use it for tests).\r\n\r\nI can send a PR if you agree with this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12943/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12943/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":852296382,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODUyMjk2Mzgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/852296382","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-08T23:07:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":852296383,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg1MjI5NjM4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/events/852296383","actor":{"login":"cebe","id":189796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe","html_url":"https://github.com/cebe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cebe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-08T23:07:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"arogachev","id":8326201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjYyMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev","html_url":"https://github.com/arogachev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arogachev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-12T17:12:50Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T17:12:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12971","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12971/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12971/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/12971/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/12971","id":188812785,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0OTMzNzAxMDQ=","number":12971,"title":"Test

PR contains the changes from #12936 by @arogachev as well as improved travis-ci configuration for NodeJS. I have squashed the work on JS tests to one commit as they were not applicable on current master (contained a lot of changes and reverts):\r\n\r\n>   **Implemented Javascript test suite**\r\n>    \r\n>    fixes #12840\r\n>    \r\n>    Used @nkovacs draft as starting\r\n>    point(https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/11037#issuecomment-193356450).\r\n>    I also fixed some bugs in `yii.validation.js` and did some refactoring.\r\n>    \r\n>    Implemented tests:\r\n>    \r\n>    - yii.validation.js\r\n>    \r\n>    Running tests:\r\n>    \r\n>    - Install Node.js. I used the latest version available at the moment -\r\n>      `v7.1.0`. Note that used `jsdom` dependent library version requires\r\n>    `Node.js >= 4`.\r\n>    - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.\r\n>    - Execute `npm test` for running tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already merged the adjustements made to the travis-ci setup to master: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/compare/729ddc5b76e8159d051e9c5783f5534eeb212efb...47ece37b5af8c3b21dc551724ba73ba5e66b40db\r\nIn combination with #13100 by @rob006 the build seems to be quite stable to me.\r\n\r\nThe changes have already been reviewed and commented in #12936. lets have a second look at what has changed in `yii.validation.js` and get this ready to be merged.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @arogachev already for preparing this and all others participating for the input.\r\n\r\n- JS is now a separate branch in the travis test suite: https://travis-ci.org/yiisoft/yii2/builds/180400521\r\n- here is the build log:
