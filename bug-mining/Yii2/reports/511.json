In Yii2 config files set following configuration for authManager.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        'authManager' => [\r\n            'class' => '\\yii\\rbac\\DbManager',\r\n            'itemTable' => '{{yii.auth_item}}',\r\n            'itemChildTable' => '{{yii.auth_item_child}}',\r\n            'assignmentTable' => '{{yii.auth_assignment}}',\r\n            'ruleTable' => '{{yii.auth_rule}}',\r\n        ],\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run migrations for RBAC using `php yii migrate --migrationPath=@yii/rbac/migration`\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nAll migrations pass successfully.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nMigration fails because it cannot create a trigger. Because following code:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n        if ($this->isMSSQL()) {\r\n            $this->execute(\"CREATE TRIGGER dbo.trigger_auth_item_child\r\n            ON dbo.{$authManager->itemTable}\r\n            INSTEAD OF DELETE, UPDATE\r\n            AS\r\n            DECLARE @old_name VARCHAR (64) = (SELECT name FROM deleted)\r\n            DECLARE @new_name VARCHAR (64) = (SELECT name FROM inserted)\r\n            BEGIN\r\n            IF COLUMNS_UPDATED() > 0\r\n                BEGIN\r\n                    IF @old_name <> @new_name\r\n                    BEGIN\r\n                        ALTER TABLE {$authManager->itemChildTable} NOCHECK CONSTRAINT FK__auth_item__child;\r\n                        UPDATE {$authManager->itemChildTable} SET child = @new_name WHERE child = @old_name;\r\n                    END\r\n                UPDATE {$authManager->itemTable}\r\n                SET name = (SELECT name FROM inserted),\r\n                type = (SELECT type FROM inserted),\r\n                description = (SELECT description FROM inserted),\r\n                rule_name = (SELECT rule_name FROM inserted),\r\n                data = (SELECT data FROM inserted),\r\n                created_at = (SELECT created_at FROM inserted),\r\n                updated_at = (SELECT updated_at FROM inserted)\r\n                WHERE name IN (SELECT name FROM deleted)\r\n                IF @old_name <> @new_name\r\n                    BEGIN\r\n                        ALTER TABLE {$authManager->itemChildTable} CHECK CONSTRAINT FK__auth_item__child;\r\n                    END\r\n                END\r\n                ELSE\r\n                    BEGIN\r\n                        DELETE FROM dbo.{$authManager->itemChildTable} WHERE parent IN (SELECT name FROM deleted) OR child IN (SELECT name FROM deleted);\r\n                        DELETE FROM dbo.{$authManager->itemTable} WHERE name IN (SELECT name FROM deleted);\r\n                    END\r\n            END;\");\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssumes that tables are in **dbo** schema. Yet auth manager tables are in **yii** schema. \r\n\r\nOne fix would be parsing table names and checking if the schema is different than **dbo**.\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround is to copy this migration to the project and change this part manually.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.15\r\n| PHP version      | 7.1.18 \r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu 16.04.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/16490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
