Although I can be wrong. Correct me if not.\r\n\r\nThis loop will execute only once. Then why is there a loop?\r\n```php\r\nforeach ($this->from as $alias => $tableName) {\r\n\tif (is_string($alias)) {\r\n\t\treturn [$tableName, $alias];\r\n\t}\r\n\tbreak;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm watching the story, and I see that the php-fixer was applied with the rule of condition reduction.\r\n\r\nOld condition\r\n```php\r\nforeach ($this->from as $alias => $tableName) {\r\n\tif (is_string($alias)) {\r\n\t\treturn [$tableName, $alias];\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt also moved to version 3.0.
