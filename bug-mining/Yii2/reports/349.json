implemented configuration for trusted hosts in #13780. The matching is currently done by regex, which caused some discussion in https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/13780#discussion_r106126378 and https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/pull/13780#discussion_r134188182.\r\n\r\n### Current implementation for `Request::$trustedHosts`\r\n\r\n```php\r\n[\r\n    '/\\.trusted\\.com$/', // match a host ending in .trusted.com\r\n    '^192\\.168\\.0\\.\\d+$', // match ip in the range `192.168.0.0/24`\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives / Problems\r\n\r\n- we use fnmatch in other places, e.g.:\r\n  - HostControl: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/9e713dba29246babefaa40ef45c4792d2d620158/framework/filters/HostControl.php#L26-L29\r\n  - AccessRule: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/9e713dba29246babefaa40ef45c4792d2d620158/framework/filters/AccessRule.php#L99-L101\r\n- the most common use case for whitelisting proxy would probably be via IP address, which is usually done using CIDR notation, this is currently not supported and quite hard to achieve when using regex.\r\n- We should probably not even allow matching host names here as it is easy to fake a reverse lookup to point to a host.\r\n\r\nAlternative to the above using fnmatch would look like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n[\r\n    '*.trusted.com', // match a host ending in .trusted.com\r\n    '192.168.0.*', // match ip in the range `192.168.0.0/24`\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAllowing CIDR would allow this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n[\r\n    '*.trusted.com', // match a host ending in .trusted.com\r\n    '192.168.0.0/24', // match ip in the range `192.168.0.0/24`\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDecision should be made before 2.0.13 as it would probably break BC.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SilverFire","id":4499203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTkyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4499203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire","html_url":"https://github.com/SilverFire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilverFire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14691/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
