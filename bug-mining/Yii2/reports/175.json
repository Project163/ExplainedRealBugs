What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nMy project contain three table : post , category , category_post_assignment\n\nI get ID of the category and search for related posts\n\n```\n$category = Category::find()\n            ->with('posts')\n            ->where(['id' => 2])\n            ->one();\n```\n\n```\n$category = Category::find()\n            ->where(['id' => 2])\n            ->one();\n\n$posts = $category->posts;\n```\n\nIn the normal first query get category from relevant table\n`SELECT * FROM `tbl_category` WHERE `id`=2`\n\nsecond query get relevant posts id from assignment table\n`SELECT * FROM `tbl_category_post_assignment` WHERE `category_id`=2`\n\nthird query get the posts from post table\n`SELECT * FROM `tbl_post` WHERE `id` IN (1, 2, ....)`\n\nThe issue is after second query if don't find relevant post the third query still execute in additional query.\n`SELECT * FROM `tbl_post` WHERE 0=1`\n### What is the expected result?\n\nWhen don't find relevant post in second query the third query shouldn't be execute.\n### Additional info\n\n| Q | A |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yii version | 2.0.9 |\n| PHP version | 7.0
