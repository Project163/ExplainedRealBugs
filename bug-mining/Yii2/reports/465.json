This seems fine, except that the UPDATE query returns the number of rows changed, and by default MySQL returns 0 changed rows when the UPDATE is identical to the existing value. I'm not sure what other databases do.\r\nThis causes `setValue()` to think the UPDATE has failed and tries a `addValue()` call, what throws an DUPLICATE KEY Exception since the data is already there. This is handled with a `return false` causing the calling functions to think the cache set has failed.\r\n\r\nA fix is to set the `PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_FOUND_ROWS` attribute to `true`. This causes MySQL to return the number of found rows instead the number of changed rows in a UPDATE call.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the correct behavior, so a better way could be to change `setValue()` to see the difference between an existing identical cache entry, or a non-existing cache entry.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n```php\r\nreturn [\r\n    ...\r\n    'components' => [\r\n        ...\r\n        'db' => [\r\n            'class' => 'yii\\db\\Connection',\r\n            'dsn' => 'mysql:host=*hostname*;dbname=*database*',\r\n            'username' => '*username*',\r\n            'password' => '*password*',\r\n            'attributes' => [\r\n                PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_FOUND_ROWS => true,\r\n            ],\r\n        ],\r\n    ],\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n```php\r\nif (!Yii::$app->cache->set('key', 'value', 86400))) {\r\n  throw new Exception(\"O my god, the cache set has failed.
