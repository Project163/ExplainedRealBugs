What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nUpload bmp or svg file with file validation rule:\r\n```\r\npublic function rules()\r\n{\r\n    return [\r\n        [['files'], 'file', 'skipOnEmpty' => false, 'extensions' => 'bmp,svg']\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nUpload should be successfull.\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n#### BMP\r\n**Test file:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmoeke/yii2-testfiles/master/test.bmp\r\n\r\ntest.bmp could not be uploaded.\r\n> Not Acceptable (#406): Array ( [files] => Array ( [0] => Only files with these extensions are allowed: bmp, svg. ) ) \r\n\r\nFileHelper::getMimeType returns at upload for test file \"image/x-ms-bmp\" (https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/validators/FileValidator.php#L403)\r\n\r\nAccording to https://filext.com/file-extension/BMP the full list of mimetypes for bmp is:\r\n> image/bmp, image/x-bmp, image/x-bitmap, image/x-xbitmap, image/x-win-bitmap, image/x-windows-bmp, image/ms-bmp, image/x-ms-bmp, application/bmp, application/x-bmp, application/x-win-bitmap\r\n\r\nSo the solution would be to add the following to the file `vendor/yiisoft/yii2/helpers/mimeAliases.php`\r\n    \r\n```\r\n    'image/x-bmp' => 'image/bmp',\r\n    'image/x-bitmap' => 'image/bmp',\r\n    'image/x-xbitmap' => 'image/bmp',\r\n    'image/x-win-bitmap' => 'image/bmp',\r\n    'image/x-windows-bmp' => 'image/bmp',\r\n    'image/ms-bmp' => 'image/bmp',\r\n    'image/x-ms-bmp' => 'image/bmp',\r\n    'application/bmp' => 'image/bmp',\r\n    'application/x-bmp' => 'image/bmp',\r\n    'application/x-win-bitmap' => 'image/bmp',\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n#### SVG\r\n**Test file:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmoeke/yii2-testfiles/master/test.svg\r\n\r\ntest.svg could not be uploaded.\r\n> Not Acceptable (#406): Array(    [files] => Array        (            [0] => Only

(https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/validators/FileValidator.php#L403)\r\n\r\nSo the solution would be to add the following to the file
