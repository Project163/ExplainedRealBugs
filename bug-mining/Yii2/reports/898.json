When validating, I get an error as if there is no file. Although in xdebug it sees in the $_FILES variable.\r\n\r\nXdebug show $_FILES \r\n![image](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/assets/8991450/d6df3518-07a3-46f5-8209-e43ede89b4b8)\r\n\r\nPOSTMAN send\r\n![image](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/assets/8991450/3cb126fb-dd3f-4410-bc3f-fb82e0f964b0)\r\n\r\nIf you specify more than 1, the validator works fine.\r\n[Similar question](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/17427)\r\n### Solution 1\r\nChange core code in File \\yii\\validators\\FileValidator::validateAttribute\r\n`if ($this->maxFiles != 1 || $this->minFiles > 1) {`\r\n to\r\n`if (!$model->$attribute instanceof UploadedFile && ($this->maxFiles >= 1 || $this->minFiles > 1)) {`\r\n\r\n### Solution 2\r\nChange my code FileForm model\r\nLook count maxFiles.\r\nDepending on the number of usage files, the corresponding function\r\n`\r\n    public function load($data, $formName = null)\r\n    {\r\n        if($this->maxFiles==1){\r\n            $this->files = UploadedFile::getInstanceByName('f[files]');\r\n        }else{\r\n            $this->files = UploadedFile::getInstancesByName('f[files]');\r\n        }\r\n        if (parent::load($data, $formName)) {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n        return false;\r\n    }`\r\nModify Handler my file\r\n`\r\n        $filesListCheck = [];\r\n        if($this->files instanceof UploadedFile){\r\n            $filesListCheck[]=$this->files;\r\n        }else{\r\n            $filesListCheck=$this->files;\r\n        }`\r\n\r\nWith 2 solutions, you have to specify in postman.\r\nWhen uploading 1 file\r\n![image](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/assets/8991450/4a0431bd-4188-4132-8379-29bd13299dda)\r\nUploading more than 1 file add **[]**\r\n![image](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/assets/8991450/87b422b9-54cb-4797-9d56-d0e3b3c65fad)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.48.1\r\n| PHP version      | 7.4\r\n| Operating system | windows Openserver 5.4.3\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/19855/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
