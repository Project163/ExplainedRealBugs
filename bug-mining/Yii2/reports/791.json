Verify that `äöêèé#####@äöêèé.de` validates when `enableIDN => true`\r\n    ```php\r\n    $email = 'äöêèé#####@äöêèé.de';\r\n    $validator = new \\yii\\validators\\EmailValidator(['enableIDN' => true]);\r\n    if ($validator->validate($email, $error)) {\r\n        echo 'Email is valid.';\r\n    } else {\r\n        echo $error;\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n2. Attempt to send an email to the same address using yii2-swiftmailer.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n\r\nGiven that SwiftMailer doesn’t allow the email, I’d expect a validation error in step 1.\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\nValidation pasess, and an exception is thrown in step 2.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | 2.0.42.1\r\n| PHP version      | 8\r\n| Operating system | Ubuntu Linux","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/18734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
