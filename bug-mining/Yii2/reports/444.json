What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nThe documentation lists an example that uses a regular expression to specify an IP range in

exception:\r\n\r\nPHP Warning – yii\\base\\ErrorException\r\nsubstr() expects parameter 3 to be integer, string given\r\n\r\nThe API docs also don't mention regular expressions, only CIDR notation.
