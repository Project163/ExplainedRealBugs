What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nIncorrect check of date field by DateValidator\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\nwith following rule for validator date filed must be validate correctly\r\n\r\n['date', 'date', 'format' => 'php:d-m-Y', 'message' => 'Invalid date format'],\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\nAdd check whether $errors variable is of type bool or array in parseDateValuePHP function (approx 445 line)\r\n\r\nI fixed it for myself as code below:\r\n\r\nif (\r\n\t    !empty($errors)\r\n\t    && (\r\n\t\t$date === false \r\n\t\t|| $errors['error_count']\r\n\t\t|| $errors['warning_count']\r\n\t\t|| ($this->strictDateFormat && $date->format($format) !== $value)\r\n\t    )\r\n)\r\n{\r\n     return false;\r\n}\r\n\r\n### Additional
