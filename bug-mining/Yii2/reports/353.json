What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nI have the following console Command:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nuse yii\\console\\Controller;\r\nclass EPagesController extends Controller\r\n{\r\n    [...]\r\n    public function actionListShops()\r\n    {\r\n        [...]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the second character of the Controller name: uppercase P. I think this is correct \"Camelcase\".\r\n\r\n### What is the expected result?\r\n```\r\n\r\n$ ./yii\r\n- epages\r\n    epages/fetch-orders-from-all-shops          Fetches all orders from all shops that uses the EPages REST API.\r\n    epages/fetch-orders-from-shop               Fetches order from specific shop.\r\n    epages/list-shops                           List all Shops that have the Epages REST-Api configured\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What do you get instead?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$./yii\r\n- epages\r\n- fixture \r\n```\r\n- every action in epages is /missing/. \r\n\r\nRenaming the controller to EpagesController instead EPagesController fixes the issue. I think the problem is here: https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/framework/console/Controller.php#L566\r\nThe Reflection does not handle one-char subparts of an camelcase string properly.\r\n\r\nThere is more, tough:\r\n\r\nLinux:\r\n```\r\n./yii epages/list-shops\r\nUnknown command: epages/list-shops\r\n\r\nDid you mean \"epages/list-shops\"?\r\n[error]           Array content is\r\n{\r\n    \"command\": \"epages/list-shops\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nhe does not find the command at all, regardless of lower or uppercase P !\r\n\r\n\r\nSame on Windows 10 (cygwin bash) works properly but only with lowercase P:\r\n```\r\n./yii epages/list-shops\r\n- works !\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Update: It works when i also rename the file to lowercase p. Win10 seems to have case-insensitive files thats why it works under win10... :) - but camelcase issue is still valid in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAny Ideas ? Did i spot a tiny bug or am i understanding CamelCase wrong? Thanks a lot!\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n| Q                | A\r\n| ---------------- | ---\r\n| Yii version      | dev-master\r\n| PHP version      | 7\r\n| Operating system | observed on Win10 and Linux\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samdark","id":47294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark","html_url":"https://github.com/samdark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samdark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yiisoft/yii2/issues/14129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
