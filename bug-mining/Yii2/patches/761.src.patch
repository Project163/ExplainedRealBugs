+Upgrade from Yii 2.0.39.3
+-------------------------

+* Priority of processing `yii\base\Arrayable`, and `JsonSerializable` data has been reversed (`Arrayable` data is checked
+  first now) in `yii\base\Model`, and `yii\rest\Serializer`. If your application relies on the previous priority you need 
+  to fix it manually based on the complexity of desired (de)serialization result.
