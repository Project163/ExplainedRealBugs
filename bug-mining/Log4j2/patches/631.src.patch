             A second type of Converter is the FileConverter - which must have "FileConverter" specified in the
-            type attribute of the Plugin annotation. While similar to a LogEventPatternConverter, instead
-            of a single format method these Converters will have two variations; one that takes an Object and
-            one that takes an array of Objects instead of the LogEvent. Both append to the provided StringBuilder
-            in the same fashion as a LogEventPatternConverter. These Converters are typically used by the
-            RollingFileAppender to construct the name of the file to log to.
