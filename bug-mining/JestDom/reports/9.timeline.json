I wanted to check that after I click on the delete button my form values are cleared and to my surprise the following test (written first) passed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexpect(getByLabelText('Connnection name')).toHaveDisplayValue(\"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nEspecially when using testing library the behaviour is unexpected: if I try to do `getByText('Select')` it will not match the `Select a fruit...` text. I believe the behaviour here should be consistent with that of testing library:
