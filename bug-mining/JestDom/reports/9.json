It seems like the toHaveDisplayValue assertion doesn't do an exact match if you pass a string as the expected value, but an \"includes\" match.  If you want to check that the display value of an element is empty, for example, you have to use a regular expression, as shown above.  (The test is designed to fail)\r\n\r\nIt also looks like before regular expressions were supported in `.toHaveDisplayValue`, it did do an exact match (though I have not tested this, only looked at the code changes).  It seems to me more intuitive that when passed a string, it should check for a full exact match, especially since that's how `.toHaveValue` works.  Thoughts?  Thank you!\r\n\r\n### Example code in a sandbox:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-testing-library-demo-forked-g5udj?file=/src/__tests__/hello.js\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gnapse","id":15199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse","html_url":"https://github.com/gnapse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
