It's hard to search for existing issues of specific libraries, since it's all under the same list of issues. I appreciate its existence because most libs don't provide typings, understandably, but I always thought (and my experience as a consumer of libraries has confirmed) that if the library itself provides the type definitions (e.g. Formik) the experience is so much better. I've been off using TS actively for a few months now, so not sure if any of the reasons for these perceptions have changed.

With the exception of very popular projects like React, the type definitions are often slightly out of date with the actual library and keeping them in sync involves more overhead than projects with typings in the repo (and more still than projects written in TypeScript).\r\n\r\nThat said, the DT review/merge process is highly automated and their notification bots are very good, so it’s quite streamlined if you are willing to put in the effort of cloning a second (giant) repo and following the instructions.\r\n\r\nIf the main concern was ease of use, a theoretical option would be to keep the type definitions inside this repo but also have a DT entry that simply does `import “@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect”;` in the global scope. I’m not sure if that’s a common/recommended practice on DT, but it would make the setup instructions for this repo consistent with other projects and keep the actual typings co-located with the

Let's see where it goes.\r\n\r\nJust to summarize my understanding: you'd like to remove friction for people acquiring type definitions. @sheetalkamat closed the [Definitely Typed PR](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/37688) as this package already has type definitions locally which could be exposed like so:\r\n\r\n> This change is not needed. The package can add `\"types\"` field to the package and thats the desired way of adding types. Refer to https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/declaration%20files/Publishing.md\r\n\r\nThis is an entirely valid solution. \r\n\r\nThe alternative is doing what the [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/pull/437) did.  i.e. dropping local definitions in favour of them being managed in DefinitelyTyped.  That's what the linked PR to Definitely Typed by @weyert is about.  If that was merged then a PR would follow for `@testing-library/jest-dom` which dropped the local type definitions and added a `dependency` for the generated `@types/testing-library__jest-dom` package.\r\n\r\nMore details in the suggestion from @kentcdodds here: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/123#issuecomment-521863263\r\n\r\nTo be entirely clear, my understanding is that the desire is to move to the latter solution (using DT) rather than the former.  Is that correct?  Or is exposing `\"types\"` via `package.json` being actively considered as well?
