Indeed, the `isSubset` function has been changed and doesn't use `getPropertyValue` anymore (see [this line](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/pull/276/files#diff-4e1129d165c9efdd245d6f1726948bbbL24)).\r\n\r\nIt seems a custom property on [`CSSStyleDeclaration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration) can't be accessed simply using the property key (for example `computedStyle['--color']`), you explicitely have to use [`getPropertyValue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration/getPropertyValue).\r\n\r\nI forked the repo and changed back the `isSubset` function to use `getPropertyValue` and things work well. That may be a solution (I assume there's a reason why it's been changed so things may not be so simple).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
