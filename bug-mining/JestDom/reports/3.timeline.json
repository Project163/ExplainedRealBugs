","body":"Wow, this effort turns out to be more complex than I initially thought, but at the same time, so more useful for end users of this library.\r\n\r\nTurns out that by abstracting away the fetching and matching of values in form elements, this could potentially allow users to make significant changes in their UI, without having to change tests too much.\r\n\r\nFor instance, this will support fetching the value of a `<select multiple>` as an array, but the same will happen when fetching the value of multiple checkboxes that share the same `name` attribute. Therefore allowing to switch between one or the other interchangeably. The same with non multiple `<select>` vs. a set of radio buttons sharing the same `name` attribute.\r\n\r\nAlso, it will abstract away the conversion of `<input type=\"number\">` values to numbers, so you can match numbers directly. The same could be true of `<input type=\"date\">` (yet to be determined, and possibly not in the first version of this).\r\n\r\nFinally, this will support only fetching groups of elements at the level of either a `<form>` or within a `<fieldset>`. This is not only to take advantage of `.elements`, but it also makes the most sense in terms of how a user would identify visually either an entire form, or parts of it clearly grouped as fieldsets.\r\n\r\nHowever, supporting all of the above will take some time, hence my posting here of the progress. Any feedback of my plans will be appreciated!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/comments/428217294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gnapse","id":15199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse","html_url":"https://github.com/gnapse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnapse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/comments/428218674","html_url":"https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/60#issuecomment-428218674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/60","id":428218674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODIxODY3NA==","user":{"login":"kentcdodds","id":1500684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1500684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds","html_url":"https://github.com/kentcdodds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T14:39:33Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T14:39:33Z","body":"This is all very encouraging!
