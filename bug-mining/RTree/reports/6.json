However in the implementation 'last' partitioning is not checked - for example when there are 9 items in the list, and minSize is 3, possible partitionings should be: 3-6,4-5,5-4,6-3; but current implementation does not generate last one.\n\nI'm not sure if it is a bug or expected behavior as I havent read original paper and I 'like' more picture generated by the original algorithm (without 'fixing this bug'). However if it is a bug then for-loop in SplitterRStar.getPairs should be changed to\n\n``` java\nfor (int i = minSize; i < list.size() - minSize + 1; i++) \n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"davidmoten","id":318187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
