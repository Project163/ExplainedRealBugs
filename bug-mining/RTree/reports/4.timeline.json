Perhaps a better name for the method or I could emphasise what add is doing in the documentation in the README. I don't like the idea of using a builder because it just makes for unnecessary typing and I'm not keen to lose method chaining.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/comments/78676118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidmoten","id":318187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/comments/78678369","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoten/rtree/issues/20#issuecomment-78678369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/20","id":78678369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4Njc4MzY5","user":{"login":"pereferrera","id":254208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDIwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/254208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera","html_url":"https://github.com/pereferrera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pereferrera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-12T23:05:14Z","updated_at":"2015-03-12T23:05:14Z","body":"Actually I thought about a normal builder, so you could chain and use it with build() in the end like .add().add().build().
