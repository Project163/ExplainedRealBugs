Signature is:\n\n``` java\npublic <R extends Geometry> Observable<Entry<T, S>> search(final R g,\n            final Func2<? super S, ? super R, Boolean> intersects);\n```\n\nYou can see that you have to provide your own intersects method. For Circles the `Intersects` class has implementations for testing intersection with other geometries.  To add useful support for Line and Ellipse then we need to add static methods to the `Intersects` class for every pair from {Circle, Rectangle, Point, Line, Ellipse}.
