The `Line` class is the only place that uses JTS so if you don't use `Line` then you can exclude the JTS dependency. \r\n\r\nIf you do want to use the `Line` class on Android then we'll have to implement the method that determines if the line intersects a rectangle locally. Not too hard to do I'm sure, I'll have a look at it.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/comments/351615882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidmoten","id":318187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1387080614,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEzODcwODA2MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/events/1387080614","actor":{"login":"davidmoten","id":318187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a7a984a8d5c5baa83d4919f87132ae074ef0c51d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/commits/a7a984a8d5c5baa83d4919f87132ae074ef0c51d","created_at":"2017-12-14T06:38:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1387405730,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTM4NzQwNTczMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/events/1387405730","actor":{"login":"davidmoten","id":318187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-12-14T10:35:54Z","rename":{"from":"Point

Android support, I found out that the `RectangleUtil.rectangleIntersectsLine` method still relies on `java.awt.geom.Line2D`.
