Using a normal PriorityQueue will do much better, or better yet, Ordering.greatestOf uses an O(n) time, O(k) memory algorithm. (We are giving some consideration to deprecating MinMaxPriorityQueue, just because it tends to get misused in this way.) – Louis Wasserman Aug 21 '15 at 17:33 \n\nI'll set up a JMH benchmark and experiment with other implementations.
