Perhaps this is why the original docs state that the results aren't sorted?\n\nIt's confusing to me, but when I print out `e.geometry().distance(searchBounds)`, I get print outs that look like this:\n\n```\n==\n0.0\n0.23379993438720703\n0.2892003059387207\n0.0\n0.12929964065551758\n0.0\n0.24679994583129883\n0.1872999668121338\n==\n```\n\nThis makes me wonder if it's actually returning the nearest results... I'll try to get a localized example of this working.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/comments/86084731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"virtuald","id":567900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald","html_url":"https://github.com/virtuald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":264850295,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY0ODUwMjk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/events/264850295","actor":{"login":"davidmoten","id":318187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-25T15:35:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":264850297,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NDg1MDI5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/events/264850297","actor":{"login":"davidmoten","id":318187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidmoten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-25T15:35:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/comments/86103688","html_url":"https://github.com/davidmoten/rtree/issues/19#issuecomment-86103688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/davidmoten/rtree/issues/19","id":86103688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MTAzNjg4","user":{"login":"virtuald","id":567900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald","html_url":"https://github.com/virtuald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virtuald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-25T16:24:02Z","updated_at":"2015-03-25T16:24:02Z","body":"Ok, so you're using a `MinMaxPriorityQueue` underneath the hood, and the iterator returns results in no particular order --- so, therefore, your original comment on the code was correct. Very interesting.\n\nIt makes sense to me why it's done this way. However, it would be nice to have a version of the nearest method that _does_ return them in sorted order.
