guessing, but I'd closely look at the array_unique. There's an extension that specifies the arg as non-empty-array and maybe that's done incorrectly. E.g. maybe isIterableAtLeastOnce incorrectly returns yes or it needs an additional check to ensure it's an iterable/array or the offset exists for sure or so. The type for data['uses'] changes from mixed to non-empty-array because of it and that must be related somehow\nIt could also be around/outside the extension, I'd still start there

The call is made on `array<string, mixed>` with the keyType `'uses'` and the value type `array{'', ''}`. And if dump the type of the newly created array:\r\nhttps://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/blob/1.9.x/src/Type/ArrayType.php#L307-L310\r\nI get\r\n```\r\narray<string, array{'', ''}>\r\n```\r\nThis is because `$unionValues` is false during the call ; which is because of `$i === 0`.
