It's not obvious what _\"this helpful tool\"_ is when reading the documentation around generating ignoreErrors.\r\n\r\nIt lacks instruction to interact with the seemingly passive documentation page.\r\n\r\n### Code snippet that reproduces the problem\r\n\r\n> This helpful tool will generate an entry that you can put in parameters.ignoreErrors section of your [configuration file](https://phpstan.org/config-reference). It deals with the complexity of writing a matching regular expression from a plain string and encoding that regular expression into the neon format.\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggest change to something like:\r\n\r\n> Using the fields below, you can generate an entry that you can put in the parameters.ignoreErrors section of your [configuration file](https://phpstan.org/config-reference).

Did it make you happy in any way?\r\n\r\nYes, very much so - big ❤️ for PHPStan. Looking at a project I haven't touched in over a year and after updating dependencies,  PHPStan's got some new errors for me to fix and will protect me as I make some new code changes!
