Rather than getting the content length `-1` is returned. The call working in this specific scenario is undocumented behaviour that some (broken) code relies on. This issue was tracked earlier as #7804 and has surfaced again couple of versions ago (not sure when exactly).\n\n### I expected the following\n\nMaybe this behaviour should be maintained since for example WebKit curl backend (*) is broken now.
