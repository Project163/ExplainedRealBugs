was found while working on the Ladybird browser project which uses libcurl in the backend to handle requests. It has its own DNS resolver capability so that, in the future, users have full control over that process rather than delegating to an underlying/system resolver. It's slightly odd but on each request, `CURLOPT_RESOLVE` is specified so the resolution is guaranteed to be coming from the internal resolver. I'm not a maintainer of Ladybird so I'm not speaking on behalf of that project, but that is how I understand it to work currently. \n\nGiven the fact that IPV4 addresses work correctly in this case,
