It should not be changed from 0 to something on iOS.\r\n\r\nSee the [llvm::Triple Class Reference](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Triple.html#ab6fdf9b428bc3d57837022121c155cbf):\r\n> ```c\r\n> [bool](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classbool.html) llvm::Triple::isOSDarwin\t(\t\t)\tconst\r\n> ```\r\n> Is this a \"Darwin\" OS (macOS, **iOS**, tvOS, watchOS, XROS, or DriverKit).\r\n\r\nSo, `TARGET_OS_MAC` is always 1 for both macOS and iOS. Moreover, checking `TARGET_OS_MAC` inside `#if defined(__APPLE__)` looks redundant.\r\n\r\nI really don't understand the change of `TARGET_OS_OSX` from 0 to 1. IMO the commit is wrong, it must not change the pre-defined `TARGET_OS_OSX`. Especially when it happens AFTER `#include <TargetConditionals.h>`. So, some system framework headers are included with `TARGET_OS_OSX` set to 0, other system framework headers are included with `TARGET_OS_OSX` set to 1. I strongly disagree with such commit and suggest that you revert it and look for other fixes for LLVM clang 18.
