for taking the time to look into this issue. \n\nThis is strange. I tested the issue from multiple sources to three different smtp servers (all running postfix 3.6.4) always with the same results. Could you also not reproduce this issue in a real world scenario outside test cases?\n\nTo make matters worse I found out that larger mails CAN be sent out if the upload file contains the closing \"\\n.\\n\"-sequence. In your test this sequence seems not to be added to the upload-file, correct?\n\nUsing tcptump on the SMTP-server I could verify that on mails <=64kB the closing sequence will be automatically added, but on larger mail the closing sequence is missing - causing the timeout as the mail ist not correcty terminated.\n\nI can provide the dumps if
