Since then the verbose port number shown on resolve is the local port and not the remote port.\n\n~~~\n* Host google.com:0 was resolved.\n* IPv6: (none)\n* IPv4: 142.250.176.206\n*   Trying 142.250.176.206:443...\n~~~\n\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/b4834a7d6d119f29a99f0c2b1230fac94d640a87/lib/hostasyn.c#L78-L80\n\nThe bug _appears_ to be localport is used instead of remote_port. There was a related bug in the ares code due to that commit and the fix was to use remote_port in follow-up 953cd694. I could do the same here but it's unclear that `conn->remote_port` is always going to be the port that was passed to Curl_resolv/Curl_resolv_timeout etc. And maybe it is possible the hostname is different than what was passed to resolve? I'm thinking revert the changes and go back to copying.","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
