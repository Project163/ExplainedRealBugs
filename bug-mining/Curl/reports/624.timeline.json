The setopt_cptr() function _does_ check for the prefixes now. `parse_ech` is the command line parser, it is not in library so that sounds sane.\r\n\r\nRight, probably just me explaining badly:-) `parse_ech` checks the command line stuff, and is able to read the ECHConfigList from a file or stdin, but `setopt_cptr` has to also do the checks in case the caller is a libcurl application rather than the command line tool. (But `setopt_cptr` doesn't support reading from a file or stdin.)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2592777894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sftcd","id":5494807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTQ4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5494807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd","html_url":"https://github.com/sftcd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sftcd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2592782359","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16006#issuecomment-2592782359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16006","id":2592782359,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6airgX","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-15T12:52:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T12:52:54Z","body":"> setopt_cptr has to also do the checks in case the caller is a libcurl application rather than the command line tool\r\n\r\nWhy?
