I did this\n\nWhen I use a version of curl that supports HTTP3, and uses the `alt-svc` cache file, domains that do have `h3` enabled don't seem to do connection reuse, where-as if I connect to `h2` the connection is reused.\r\n\r\nExample `curl.config` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nurl = \"https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCC8VtutLDSrreNEZj8CU01A\"\r\noutput = /dev/null\r\nnext\r\nurl = \"https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC7_VGkwCoKfqh1eZEkzey3A\"\r\noutput = /dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\n`curl --alt-svc alt-svc.txt -v -K curl.config`\r\n\r\nThe first time (with verbose) and an empty alt-svc, I can see this log message between the first and second transfer:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Re-using existing connection with host www.youtube.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running curl a second time with a populated alt-svc cache it connects using hhttp3 and it does not say 'Re-using existing connection' but\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Connected to www.youtube.com () port 443\r\n```\r\n(and I verified that it wasn't just a logging issue - when I ran tcpdump I could see that it was opening a new udp connection with a different source port).\n\n### I expected the following\n\nFor subsequent connections are reused to the same host when using http3.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.10.0 (aarch64-apple-darwin) libcurl/8.10.0 OpenSSL/3.3.2 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.6
