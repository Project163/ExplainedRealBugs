(See patch below.)\n\nThis leads to a number of failures where existing code assumes that freeing uninitialized dynbufs is fine. As long as the struct is otherwise cleared, this is actually fine, but is a fragile thing to depend on. Plus, without the assert we cannot easily detect if the free is done on a dynbuf that was *not* cleared.\n\n~~~diff\n--- a/lib/dynbuf.c\n+++ b/lib/dynbuf.c\n@@ -57,10 +57,11 @@ void Curl_dyn_init(struct dynbuf *s, size_t toobig)\n  * 'init' field and thus this buffer can be reused to add data to again.\n  */\n void Curl_dyn_free(struct dynbuf *s)\n {\n   DEBUGASSERT(s);\n+  DEBUGASSERT(s->init == DYNINIT);\n   Curl_safefree(s->bufr);\n   s->leng = s->allc = 0;\n }\n \n /*\n~~~\n\n### I expected the following\n\n`Curl_dyn_free()` should only free dynbufs that have been initialized with `Curl_dyn_init()`-\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ngit master\n\n### operating system\n\nall","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
