my tests `--disable-docs` doesn't prevent building libcurl `.3` files. It seems to require `--disable-manual` to have an effect. I expected the new option to disable libcurl man pages, regardless of the `--enable-manual`/`--disable-manual` setting (`--enable-manual` being the default). I understand both must be disabled if Perl is missing, yet the current behaviour is confusing in requiring another non-default option. It could also be more useful if the new option worked independently of that existing one.\r\n\r\nCMake already does this with its `ENABLE_CURL_MANUAL` and `BUILD_LIBCURL_DOCS` options. Perl is the prerequisite for both and they are independently controlling `curl.1` + curl tool manual embedding and building libcurl `.3` files respectively.

I *am* still interested in the manual for the curl tool, but my system also does not have perl. Previously, perl was *already* needed to generate `curl.1`, but this was no problem since a prebuilt version of `curl.1` was included in the dist tarball.\r\n\r\nSince @arachsys only encountered this issue in 8.6.0, I'm guessing that the real issue here is not that perl is needed to generate the manuals (since that was the case before 8.6.0), but that the generated `curl.1` was dropped from the release tarball, and the now-generated libcurl man pages were not added to the release tarball.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, as of git master, there still are some distributed generated man pages: `docs/curl-config.1` and `docs/mk-ca-bundle.1`. However, these aren't very useful since `curl-config.1` is only installed with `--enable-docs`, which can only be enabled when perl is available.\r\n\r\nHere's my proposal:\r\n- Revert the `--disable-docs` change to configure.ac.\r\n- Add `curl.1` and the generated libcurl man pages to dist.\r\n\r\nThoughts on this? I can make a pull request if you think this idea is acceptable. I would also be fine if just curl.1 were added back, and the configure flag allowed further granularity (like what was done with cmake) so that perl would only be needed when building the libcurl manuals.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1933271873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"michaelforney","id":52851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelforney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelforney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11740117606,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c5901YSzwAAAAK7w_pm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/11740117606","actor":{"login":"arachsys","id":299056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTA1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys","html_url":"https://github.com/arachsys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-08T02:34:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11740117610,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c5901YSzwAAAAK7w_pq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/11740117610","actor":{"login":"arachsys","id":299056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTA1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys","html_url":"https://github.com/arachsys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arachsys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-08T02:34:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11741486246,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c5901YSzwAAAAK72Nym","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/11741486246","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b990cc78b3c563b54b6d6967e54a7314c2862d16","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/b990cc78b3c563b54b6d6967e54a7314c2862d16","created_at":"2024-02-08T06:59:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bagd
