For memory exhaustion, a system with OOM reaper may also eventually take action.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nConsidering this is such a basic security issue, curl should have a built-in option to limit its output size from `stdout`/`-o`/`--output`. Once the hard limit for output size has been reached, curl should stop reading from the network and terminate with curl error `23` or probably better would be a new error code to indicate this exact error.\r\n\r\nI propose one of `--max-size` (similar to `--max-time`), `--max-output`, or `--max-out-size` (similar to `--max-filesize` which doesn't serve as a hard limit) to stay aligned with option names already existing in curl.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.0.1\n\n### operating system\n\nFedora Linux 38","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11810/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11810/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
