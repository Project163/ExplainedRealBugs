I discovered during work on #12897, libcurl does not support use of `inline` keyword because libcurl can be built with unusual combination of old compiler and cmake.\r\nWhen built by old compiler and autotools (configure), `inline` macro is defined to a suitable replacement (or empty string) if need.\r\nThe missing part is cmake checks for `inline` support.\r\nThis PR adds support for cmake detection of `inline`.\r\nAs a fallback path, `inline` compiler-time detection is implemented in `curl_setup.h`, so even if build system does not check for inline support for any reason the header will substitute a suitable replacement.\r\n\r\nWith this PR merged, libcurl and curl code can freely use `inline` keyword.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
