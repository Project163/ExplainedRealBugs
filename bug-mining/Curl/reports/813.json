Can persist if cache timeout is infinite. Misleads users with the wrong error.\\\n**Repro:** Induce low-memory so `mk_entry` or cache insertion fails after `addr` is obtained. Next lookup returns negative-cached failure.\\\n**Expected:** No negative caching on post-resolve bookkeeping failures; return a failure without poisoning cache (keeping `Curl_resolv()`'s return contract).\\\n**Actual:** Returns `CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_HOST` and negative-caches.\\\n**Fix (minimal):** Handle these two OOM sites by returning directly with a log (`failf`) and **do not** jump to `error:` (which does negative caching).\n\n### I expected the following\n\ndoes not negative cache\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurrent\n\n### operating system\n\nall","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
