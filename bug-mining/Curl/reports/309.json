I used curl 8.2.1 to connect to a website with OpenSSL 3.0.\r\n2. I called the OpenSSL function X509_STORE_set_ex_data to set the external data with an X509_STORE. \r\n3. Then, I called the OpenSSL function  SSL_CTX_set_verify with a callback function.\r\n4. In the callback function, I called the X509_STORE_get_ex_data to get the external data.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n4.  To obtain the external data.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n4. the external data is NULL. Curl cleared it before the callback function.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis issue doesn't occur if I use curl with OpenSSL1.0.2.\r\n\r\nMy investigation:\r\nRoot cause:\r\nIn lib/vtls/openssl.c, line 280,  the macro HAVE_SSL_X509_STORE_SHARE is only defined in curl when OpenSSL >= 1.1.0.\r\nThere is a function named Curl_ssl_setup_x509_store at line 3368, and it will be called in the ossl_connect_step2.\r\nFor OpenSSL3.0, it will call the OpenSSL function SSL_CTX_set_cert_store, if there is a cached_store and the cache_criteria_met is true.\r\nThe SSL_CTX_set_cert_store will clear the external data we set in the ssl_ctx before.\r\n\r\n\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI expected that curl will not clear the ex data in the ossl_connect_step2 with OpenSSL3.0. \n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.2.1\n\n### operating system\n\nmacOS 13.5.1 (22G90)","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11800/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
