Note that my `./configure` invocation is the same for both cases.\n\nThe detection is not using Windows headers, so `_WIN32_WINNT` does\nnot have an effect here. It's just checking whether the symbol links.\n\nIt reproduces with the commands in `config.log`, thanks for pasting them.\nUsing a different mingw-w64 distro and also with llvm-mingw.\n\n`conftest.c` used by `configure`:\n```c\n#define if_nametoindex innocuous_if_nametoindex\n#ifdef __STDC__\n# include <limits.h>\n#else\n# include <assert.h>\n#endif\n#undef if_nametoindex\n#ifdef __cplusplus\nextern \"C\"\n#endif\nchar if_nametoindex ();\n#if defined __stub_if_nametoindex || defined __stub___if_nametoindex\n#error force compilation error\n#endif\n\nint main(void)\n{\nreturn if_nametoindex ();\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n```\n$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o conftest.exe conftest.c -liphlpapi\nld.lld: error: undefined symbol: _if_nametoindex\n$ x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -o conftest.exe conftest.c -liphlpapi\n```\n\nWhat seems to be happening is that the 64-bit implib doesn't\nhave the symbol dressed up with argument type information\n(`__imp_if_nametoindex`), while the 32-bit one does\n(`__imp__if_nametoindex@4`). So in 64-bit it passes with the\nfake declaration used for detection, but in 32-bit it doesn't\nunless making it a `(char *)`. This is due to different callconv\nin 32/64-bit I guess, but it's been a while I've been dealing with\nthis.\n\nIt means the 32-bit detection is in fact broken for this particular\nsymbol at least.\n\nThe solution is to use a different feature detection method for\nWindows

`check_function_exists()` (cmake) do\r\n  not work on Windows, for two reasons:\r\n  - the function may be disabled at compile-time in Windows headers \r\n    when targeting old Windows versions (XP or WS2003 in curl context)\r\n    via `_WIN32_WINNT`. But it's always present in the system implib\r\n    `iphlpapi` where these checks are looking.\r\n  - for 32-bit Windows the function signature in the implib requires\r\n    a 4-byte argument, while these checks always use no arguments,\r\n    making them always fail.\r\n\r\n- cmake: call `if_nametoindex` dynamically with mingw-w64 v1.0.\r\n  This mingw-w64 version lacks prototype and implib entry for it.\r\n\r\n- cmake: add auto-detection for Windows and use as a fallback for\r\n  non-pre-fill cases.\r\n\r\n- cmake: disable pre-fill with `_CURL_PREFILL=OFF`. (for testing)\r\n\r\n- cmake: disable pre-fill for untested compilers. (i.e. non-MSVC,\r\n  non-mingw64)\r\n\r\n- GHA/windows: make an autotools job build for Windows XP.\r\n\r\nFollow-up to 0d71b18153c8edb996738f8a362373fc72d0013b #17413\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3094956847","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/17979#issuecomment-3094956847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17979","id":3094956847,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c64eUsv","user":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-21T00:40:50Z","updated_at":"2025-07-21T07:28:51Z","body":"Made #17982, fixing this, plus making a couple of improvements for cmake.
