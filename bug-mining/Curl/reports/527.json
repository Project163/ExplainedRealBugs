When that issue was fixed by 764e4f06 it did not fix that part of the issue. Instead it was written in a specific way to not do that. findfile will search for curlrc (no leading dot) in $CURL_HOME/.config/curlrc and $HOME/.config/curlrc, but only if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set and .curlrc has not been found anywhere else.\r\n\r\nHere's two typical setups and how curl currently behaves:\r\n\r\nIf CURL_HOME is not set, and XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set, and HOME is set, then the order is:\r\n\r\n- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.curlrc\r\n- $HOME/.curlrc\r\n- [`pw_dir`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/basedefs/pwd.h.html)/.curlrc\r\n\r\nIf CURL_HOME is not set, and XDG_CONFIG_HOME is **not** set, and HOME is set, then the order is:\r\n\r\n- $HOME/.curlrc\r\n- $HOME/.config/curlrc _(this path is checked because XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set)_\r\n- [`pw_dir`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/basedefs/pwd.h.html)/.curlrc\r\n\r\nNote pw_dir is usually the same as $HOME.\r\n\r\nNote for brevity I've excluded how we also search for _curlrc when .curlrc is not found, since that logic just complicates understanding this and AFAICT it's not relevant here.\r\n\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or not since the commit was written specifically not to strip the dot from curlrc when checking XDG_CONFIG_HOME, and I can't figure from the discussion why it was done that way.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.4.0\n\n### operating system\n\nLinux","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12129/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
