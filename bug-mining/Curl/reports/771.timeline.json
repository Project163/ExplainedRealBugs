job:\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/actions/runs/16708936564/job/47290997983\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3148681514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":18959248795,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c7D7IjQzwAAAARqDy2b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/18959248795","actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-03T20:37:03Z","label":{"name":"cmake","color":"d4c5f9"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18959249133,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c7D7IjQzwAAAARqDy7t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/18959249133","actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-03T20:37:09Z","label":{"name":"regression","color":"33aa3f"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3148684642","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/18149#issuecomment-3148684642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18149","id":3148684642,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c67rR1i","user":{"login":"wkornewald","id":134387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDM4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald","html_url":"https://github.com/wkornewald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkornewald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":f
