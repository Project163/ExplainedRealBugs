The API returns success and does not invoke write call back. Once resumed, I see write call back delivering more data per second then what is being configured using CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE.  This issue has been reported here: https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/3240 and fix available in 7.69.1, but it does not seems to be working. \r\n\r\nI have tried returning CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE inside write callback. Same result.\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\nI don't expect any data exchange between server and client till resume is called. Even after resuming, expecting CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE data size to be delivered not more than that.\r\n\r\nAnd also would like to know what is the maximum time we can pause the http connection.\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\nCurrently using 7.69.1 and  tested with latest also 7.84.0 \r\n\r\n[curl -V output]\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\nUbuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n<!-- On Unix please post the output of \"uname -a\" -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
