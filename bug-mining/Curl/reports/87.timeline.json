there does not seem to be a standard for support of `noproxy`/`no_proxy` (or even alignment on which it should be and which should take precedence), curl has for a long time or forever supported entries like `.mydomain.com` as a \"wildcard\" for `a.mydomain.com`, `b.mydomain.com`, etc.\r\n\r\nAs of 7.86.0, now distributed in Git for Windows and Msys2 (among many other environments I imagine), this no longer works, and domains must be individually specified in full.\r\n\r\nThis looks, at a glance, like it must be a regression in #9773, although I haven't taken the time to understand the code changes.\r\n\r\nThis is likely to impact users in corporate and academic environments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
