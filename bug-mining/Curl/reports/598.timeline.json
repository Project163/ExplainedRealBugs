don't see any place in the code where a monotonic clock time is combined with another time. The only place I can see a inconsistent time being used is if the call to get the monotonic time fails in which case the real time is used, but the time parts aren't mixed and the kinds of things that could go wrong with getting the monotonic time mean that it's unlikely that both would be found in the same log file. I think you're probably just seeing the difference between monotonic time and real time on your system.\r\n\r\nThe change to monotonic time seems to have been made 16 years ago in commit 19479ea021 and I don't recall this issue being brought up before. It probably doesn't matter much if the trace log is used in isolation, but if you're trying to correlate with external events in other log files, it would make a huge difference. The original change was probably done to avoid problems with internal timeouts, but log timestamping is sufficiently different that it's probably worth switching back to real time for that
