Sending a newline in an HTTP header only makes sense if (as I was) one is trying to test a web server (in my case a custom patch for NGINX), but I was _not_ expecting to get:\n\n```\ncurl: nghttp3_conn.c:2463: nghttp3_conn_shutdown_stream_read: Assertion `stream_id >= 0' failed.\n```\n\nand a core dump.\n\nI don’t consider this a security vulnerability because the documentation is very clear that it is the application’s job to sanitize headers passed to curl, and indeed if the request was made using HTTP/1.x then allowing newlines in headers leads to header value injection or even request smuggling.  Other invalid header values (like `a: \\x01`) don’t trigger this issue.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI’m not sure.  Perhaps curl should give an error stating that newlines aren’t allowed in headers.  In any case, curl shouldn’t crash.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.13.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.13.0 OpenSSL/3.4.1 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.7 libidn2/2.3.7 libpsl/0.21.5 libssh2/1.11.1 nghttp2/1.65.0 nghttp3/1.8.0\nRelease-Date: 2025-04-02\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n\n### operating system\n\nLinux nginx 6.12.21-1.qubes.fc37.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Mar 31 11:38:40 GMT 2025 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
