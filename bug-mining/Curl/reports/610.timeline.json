Nixpkgs version\r\n\r\n- Stable (24.11)\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nAfter updating `nixos-24.11` to `635e887b48521e912a516625eee7df6cf0eba9c1`, I'm running into error `Unexpected error 9 on netlink descriptor 60` while pulling flake inputs with Nix (using libcurl).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIt's hard to reproduce, but this sporadically happens when fetching flake inputs with `nix`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nFetching inputs should work\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure this is related to https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/15725 (fixed in https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ff5091aa9f73802e894b1cbdf24ab84e103200e2, but unreleased)\r\n\r\nI think it would be a good idea to apply this patch until curl `8.12` is released.\r\n\r\nArch Linux went ahead and disabled eventfd support in curl as it was causing issues with pacman: https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/curl/-/commit/1963701abfc6e9f20db4052c629fc842413828b2\r\n\r\n### System metadata\r\n\r\n```\r\n - system: `\"aarch64-linux\"`\r\n -
