One of which is Winsock sockets, also, are not \"proper\" file descriptors and `read()` won't work, they need a `recv()` call on Windows instead. I can keep chipping away at that.\n\nAnother issue has arisen though. The `--upload-file .` functionality doesn't work at all on Curl 8.14 (testing under Linux). The input is never read from STDIN. I did some more digging and reading from STDIN with `--upload-file .` worked correctly under 8.7.1, reading from STDIN became slow from curl 8.8 onwards, and stopped working completely in 8.14. Since this is unrelated to the Windows-specific behavior, I'll go ahead and get some better evidence of this behavior and open another issue.
