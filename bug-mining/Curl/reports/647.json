After looking at #3993 (which I believe was looking at a related issue), I tried this:\r\n```bash\r\ncurl --interface eth0 -vg -6 'http://[fe80:928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx]:8080/healthz'\r\n```\r\n(this is the link-local ipv6 address on the network interface of another machine on the same LAN, which works over IPv4).\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\nIt should have successfully bound to the `eth0` interface and made the connection, but instead I got the following:\r\n```\r\n*    Trying [fe80::928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx]:8080...\r\n* Local Interface eth0 is ip fe80::ec4:xxff:fexx:xxx%2 using address family 10\r\n* Name 'fe80::ec4:xxff:fexx:xxx' family 10 resolved to 'fe80::ec4:xxff:fexx:xxx' family 10\r\n* bind failed with errno 22: Invalid argument\r\n* Failed to connect to fe80::928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx port 8080 after 0ms: Failed binding local connection end\r\n* closing connection #0\r\ncurl: (45) bind failed with errno 22: Invalid argument\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect it is trying to bind to the local interface with an ipv4 socket even though the address and protocol for the remote end is ipv6, but I don't really know (hence why the reference to #3993 ).\r\n\r\nI know the connection is working as `ping6 -I eth0 fe80::928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx` binds and sends/receives the packets.\r\n\r\n#### possible workaround\r\nI can work around this `--interface` specification by using the interface scope in the URI - this works as expected:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -vg -6 'http://[fe80::928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx%eth0]:8080/healthz'\r\n*    Trying [fe80::928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx]:8080...\r\n* Connected to fe80::928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx (fe80::928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx) port 8080\r\n> GET /healthz HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: [fe80::928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx]:8080\r\n> User-Agent: curl/8.9.1\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n>\r\n* Request completely sent off\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Content-Length: 17\r\n< Content-Type: application/json\r\n< Date: Wed, 04 Sep 2024 11:04:38 GMT\r\n<\r\n{\"healthy\":true}\r\n* Connection #0 to host fe80::928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx left intact\r\n```\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\ncurl 8.9.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.9.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips zlip/1.2.7 OpenLDAP/2.4.44\r\nRelease-Date 2024-07-31\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS HSTS HTTPS-proxy IPv6 Largefile libz NTLM SSL threadsafe UnixSockets\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nLinux hostname 3.10.0-1160.81.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP\r\nCentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core)\r\n\r\nThis is the same with both the system-provided curl and the latest curl that I built from source.","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14782/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
