A better fix would be to apply a 'CURL_' prefix to the define i.e. 'CURL_OS' so that a string literal is not expanded incorrectly in place of OS.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.10.1\n\n### operating system\n\nOS/400 V7R4M0","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15455/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
