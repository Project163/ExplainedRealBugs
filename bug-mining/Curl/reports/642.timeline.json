Our end of the warnings seems to be working correctly (after double checking\r\nthem).\r\n\r\nOne suspect is OpenSSL configuration. It's kind of hard to tell what options \r\ndo vcpkg and AppVeyor use in their OpenSSL builds, let alone figuring out \r\nthe build defaults.\r\n\r\nThis curl codepath needs the OpenSSL **UI feature**. So I [added](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/16238/commits/a88cbbec035b606044a83b2ef148a5e5ad6f080a) an `#error`\r\nthere and sure enough, it's not hit either:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/actions/runs/13210670321/job/36883398358\r\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl/builds/51476216\r\n\r\nIt looks like vcpkg/AppVeyor OpenSSL binaries do not have UI enabled, which\r\nwould make sense because in a headless CI env, a UI popup hangs the job.\r\n\r\nThis also explains why I [bumped](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/5f2fd0b63a02f9df0ac730c5075f7aab2a245dbf) into these warnings with iOS and the Carthage\r\nOpenSSL build, which must have left UI enabled.\r\n\r\nedit: ~~to give it a CI test, we may force-enable this section and add the necessary\r\nOpenSSL functions as stubs.~~ UI is enabled in our custom quictls build in
