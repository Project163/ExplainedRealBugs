The issue is visible here:\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-7_87_0/lib/vtls/x509asn1.c#L1355\r\n\r\nThe code doesn't compile and it also leaks some memory for empty (\"\") strings if parenthesis are added. The issue was introduced by commit https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/6b19247e794cfdf4ec63c5880d8f4f5485f653ab\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution is to revert the first section of the patch. Note how `utf8asn1str` always sets the pointer to NULL on error.\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\ncurl-7_87_0 tag\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
