I did this\n\nUpload a text file to an FTP server through curllib with CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT set to 1 and CURLOPT_INFILESIZE (or INFILESIZE_LARGE) set to the file's size. The upload fails with error code 18 (CURL_PARTIAL_FILE_SIZE) and on the print callbacks the 'Uploaded unaligned file size (92030 out of 92048 bytes)' error message is visible. Mind you the contents of the file are intact, the file transfer was actually successful.\r\n\r\nThe text file should be at least ~72 kilobytes (I think it has to do something with the upload buffer size, because increasing the buffer size above 100 kilobytes makes the issue disappear), it should contain at least 6000 newline characters (so the LF->CRLF conversion would make the file ~12 kilobytes bigger) for this change to materialize itself.\r\n\r\nSetting CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT to 0 disabled the LF->CRLF conversion, and the issue disappeared in this case the uploaded bytes were equal to the file size. Unsetting the INFILESIZE option also resolved this issue (with TRANSFERTEXT on), in this case the transferred bytes were ~12 kilobytes more, than the file size on the disk (supposedly, because of the LF->CRLF conversion).\r\nAlso, setting CURLOPT_CRLF to 1, also resolved this issue.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like in case of the combo of CUROPT_TRANSFERTEXT and  CURLOPT_INFILESIZE file size estimation is not working correctly if the file size is bigger than the UPLOAD_BUFFERSIZE.\r\n\r\nThe code I am maintaining is quite rigid and buggy, so I don't want to mess around and try what happens turning off either of these options.\r\nOn 7.86.0 it just works without saying\r\nOn 8.8.0 it doesn't\n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\n8.8.0\n\n### operating system\n\nLinux 3.10.108","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14713/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
