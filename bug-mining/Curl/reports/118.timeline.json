BoringSSL maintainer here. Came across this. I don't think the workaround is right. I haven't tried it, but I believe the bug is actually these lines here:\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/bd9c9a4ea145f12bb535f85034fbbf48674a2549/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L718\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/bd9c9a4ea145f12bb535f85034fbbf48674a2549/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L748\r\n\r\n`BIO_read` and `BIO_write` return negative numbers on error, including retryable ones. This seems to have been a regression from https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/55807e6c056f27846d70cec70ee6ac3f0e5b3bbe. Both branches should be returning -1.\r\n\r\nThe APIs are patterned after POSIX `read` and `write` which, similarly, return -1 on errors, not zero, with `EAGAIN` treated as an error:\r\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604599/functions/read.html\r\n\r\nThat (newer) OpenSSL isn't noticing it is due a mess of quirks around stemming from them mixing some things up when introducing the `BIO_read_ex` APIs. (See https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/8208; they basically forgot that `BIO_read` already had an EOF convention and thought -1 and 0 were the same.) I expect older OpenSSLs would have the same behavior as BoringSSL here. You can see how, in 1.0.2, `SSL_get_error` only returned `SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ` on -1, not 0:\r\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable/ssl/ssl_lib.c#L2729\r\n\r\nTry, instead,
