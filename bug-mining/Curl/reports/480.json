This problem does not occur when curl is built using openssl. I'm not sure whether this is a curl bug or a gnutls bug.\r\n\r\nFor prior history on issues accessing this server, which intentionally uses a canonical name ending in a period, see #8290 reported by @ccazabon. There, the problem was that curl *was* stripping the period from the hostname for non-SNI purposes when it should not have been doing so.\r\n\r\n### I did this\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -I https://pyropus.ca./\r\n```\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Fri, 19 Apr 2024 16:21:47 GMT\r\nServer: Apache/2.4.57 (Debian)\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\nVary: Accept-Encoding\r\nX-Frame-Options: sameorigin\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n```\r\n\r\n### but I got this\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl: (60) SSL: certificate subject name (pyropus.ca) does not match target host name 'pyropus.ca.'\r\nMore details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html\r\n\r\ncurl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not\r\nestablish a secure connection to it.
