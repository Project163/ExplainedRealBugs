I did this\r\n\r\nI built curl with HTTP/3 support following [the guide](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#quiche-version). \r\nThis via a dockerfile at https://github.com/rmarx/curl-http3.\r\n\r\nLoading urls over H3 with the `--http3` flag works fine, it's when I **omit** the `--http3` flag (hoping to use HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 as \"normal\" and for example test alt-svc) that I get the \"Resource temporarily unavailable\" error. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n% docker run -it --rm rmarx/curl-http3 curl -IL https://www.cloudflare.com --verbose\r\n*   Trying 104.16.123.96:443...\r\n* Connected to www.cloudflare.com (104.16.123.96) port 443 (#0)\r\n* ALPN: offers http/1.1\r\n*  CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\r\n*  CApath: none\r\n* [CONN-0-0][CF-SSL] TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):\r\n* BoringSSL SSL_connect: Resource temporarily unavailable in connection to www.cloudflare.com:443 \r\n* Closing connection 0\r\ncurl: (35) BoringSSL SSL_connect: Resource temporarily unavailable in connection to www.cloudflare.com:443\r\n```\r\n\r\nShelling into the docker container and running curl inside gives the same error, so it's not a \"docker interface\" issue. \r\n\r\nI see that there are [several similar issues](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%22Resource+temporarily+unavailable%22+is%3Aclosed+) reported for other TLS libs, e.g., #6896 and #6864, though they seem to fail when loading HTTP/3, not H1 or H2. Additionally, the fixes there don't immediately seem applicable here, so I'm not sure what to do.  \r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\nThat the curl build with BoringSSL+quiche also loads URLs over HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, not just HTTP/3. \r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\ncurl 7.87.0-DEV (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.87.0-DEV BoringSSL quiche/0.16.0\r\nRelease-Date: [unreleased]\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS HSTS HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL threadsafe UnixSockets\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nLinux ab3f6635b7ba 5.10.104-linuxkit #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Mar 17 17:05:54 UTC 2022 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10013/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
