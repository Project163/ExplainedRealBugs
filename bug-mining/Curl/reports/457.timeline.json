Contact Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\nbuilt from master just a day ago\n\n### Description\n\nWhen I build curl to do HTTP/3 using ngtcp2+nghttp3 and wolfSSL, I can connect to a host with a properly signed certificate but for the wrong name - without wolfSSL shouting at me.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can connect to a host that serves `curl.se` but insist that the host name is `example`, which then should fail the certificate check since there is no SAN name for `example` in that server. This can be tested with a curl command line\r\n\r\nThis issue was initially filed against curl here: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/13487 (and there is a recproducer shown there)\r\n\r\n... but the problem *seems* to be the wolfSSL function.\r\n\r\nThe same function (wolfSSL_check_domain_name) returns error correctly when used over TCP, like for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\nIt is a little bit complicated. I have only tried with a curl build, which can be made as [described here](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#build-with-wolfssl).\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No
