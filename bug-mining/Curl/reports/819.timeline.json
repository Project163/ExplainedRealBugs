If one of the two workarounds is applied by uncommenting the corresponding lines, it would complete normally. I have changed the test URL from httpbin.org to https://echo.free.beeceptor.com because somehow httpbin.org service is not available here. Feel free to change it to any POST endpoint with a correct `Expect: 100-continue` handling.\n\nHope that

#18848\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen using `curl_multi` with MIME uploads that have paused read callbacks, if the callback returns `CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE` while waiting for a 100-continue response, the callback is never retriggered after calling `curl_easy_pause(CURLPAUSE_SEND_CONT)`, causing the upload to hang indefinitely.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe exp100 client reader used the default control handler (`Curl_creader_def_cntrl`) which ignores `CURL_CRCNTRL_UNPAUSE` events. When unpause was triggered:\n\n1. The MIME reader received the unpause event and cleared its pause state\n2. The exp100 reader ignored the unpause event and remained in `EXP100_AWAITING_CONTINUE` state\n3. Subsequent read attempts were blocked by exp100, preventing the MIME callback from being retriggered\n\nThis created a synchronization bug between two independent flow control mechanisms (MIME pause state and exp100 state machine).\n\n## Solution\n\nImplemented `cr_exp100_cntrl()` to handle `CURL_CRCNTRL_UNPAUSE` events. When unpaused while in `EXP100_AWAITING_CONTINUE` state, the handler transitions to `EXP100_SEND_DATA` state (as if the 100 response was received), allowing the read chain to proceed and retrigger the MIME callback.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Added `cr_exp100_cntrl()` function following the same pattern as `cr_mime_cntrl()` \n- Updated `cr_exp100` structure to use the new control handler instead of the default\n- When `CURL_CRCNTRL_UNPAUSE` is received while awaiting 100-continue, calls `http_exp100_continue()` to transition state\n- Other control opcodes fall through to default (no-op)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `lib/http.c`: Added `cr_exp100_cntrl()` control handler (26 lines added, 1 line changed)\n\n## Testing\n\nVerified with single-threaded reproducer from issue #18848:\n- MIME upload with paused callback during 100-continue wait\n- Callback is correctly retriggered after unpause\n- Upload completes successfully without hanging\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- No API changes\n- No breaking changes\n- Purely additive fix for broken behavior\n- Aligns with existing timeout behavior (exp100 also proceeds on timeout)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20398142806,"node_id":"AE_lADOAAiu0c7PqbqJzwAAAAS_0vVW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20398142806","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-21T08:16:25Z","assignee":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20402504547,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c7PqbqJzwAAAATAFYNj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20402504547","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b5de13c33a59463f66d27815650a3cbc71bacfa2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/icing/curl/commits/b5de13c33a59463f66d27815650a3cbc71bacfa2","created_at":"2025-10-21T11:52:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-21T11:53:05Z","updated_at":"2025-10-21T11:53:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19178","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19178/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19178/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/
