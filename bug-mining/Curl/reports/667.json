Besides the already reported and fixed (thanks!) [regression in trurl's test suite](https://ci.debian.net/packages/t/trurl/unstable/amd64/58631222/#L398), we are seeing 2 more regressions. [One in liboauth2's test suite](https://ci.debian.net/packages/libo/liboauth2/unstable/amd64/58601477/#L1107) and [another one in pycurl's test suite](https://ci.debian.net/packages/p/pycurl/unstable/amd64/58601553/#L1261).\n\n## Pycurl's regression\n\nDigging a bit deeper in pycurl's tests, I get the following trace:\n\n```\nself = <tests.getinfo_test.GetinfoTest testMethod=test_getinfo_cookie_invalid_utf8_python3>\n\n    @util.only_python3\n    def test_getinfo_cookie_invalid_utf8_python3(self):\n        self.curl.setopt(self.curl.COOKIELIST, '')\n        self.make_request('/set_cookie_invalid_utf8', 'cookie set')\n\n        self.assertEqual(200, self.curl.getinfo(pycurl.HTTP_CODE))\n\n        info = self.curl.getinfo(pycurl.INFO_COOKIELIST)\n>       domain, incl_subdomains, path, secure, expires, name, value = info[0].split(\"\\t\")\nE       IndexError: list index out of range\n\ninfo       = []\nself       = <tests.getinfo_test.GetinfoTest testMethod=test_getinfo_cookie_invalid_utf8_python3>\n\ntests/getinfo_test.py:90: IndexError\n```\n\nCould it be a regression from 1aea05a6c2699e80c75936d58569851555acd603, 597ee915c4c6da132dbd1735345b4fa511fde6f6 or 0064708f3f1879e0982f5486ebae25e28bee27d8? Or could it be a problem in pycurl's test suite and I should report it to pycurl directly?\n\n## Liboauth2's Regression\n\nDuring liboauth2 test suite execution, failures happened and looking at the logs the following lines caught my attention:\n\n```\n[src/http.c:1100:oauth2_http_call:ERR] curl_easy_perform() failed on: http://127.0.0.1:8080/test/check_jose/jwks_uri (Unsupported protocol: Unsupported HTTP/1 subversion in response)\n```\n\n### I expected the following\n\nNo failures in reverse-dependencies at all :-)\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.13.0-rc1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.13.0-rc1 GnuTLS/3.8.9 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.6 libidn2/2.3.8 libpsl/0.21.2 libssh2/1.11.1 nghttp2/1.64.0 ngtcp2/1.11.0 nghttp3/1.8.0 librtmp/2.3 OpenLDAP/2.6.9\nRelease-Date: 2025-03-08, security patched: 8.13.0~rc-1~exp2\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n\n\n### operating system\n\nDebian experimental\n\nLinux x1-carbon 6.12.12-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.12.12-1 (2025-02-02) x86_64 GNU/Linux","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
