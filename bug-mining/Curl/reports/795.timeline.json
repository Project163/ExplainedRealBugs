this patch `accept4()`, `socket()`, `socketpair()`, `send()` and\r\n`recv()` system symbols were remapped via macros, using the same name,\r\nto local curl debug wrappers. This patch replaces these overrides by\r\nintroducing curl-namespaced macros that map either to the system symbols\r\nor to their curl debug wrappers in `CURLDEBUG` (TrackMemory) builds.\r\n\r\nThis follows a patch that implemented the same for `accept()`.\r\n\r\nThe old method required tricks to make these redefines work in unity\r\nbuilds, and avoid them interfering with system headers. These tricks\r\ndid not work for system symbols implemented as macros.\r\n\r\nThe new method allows to setup these mappings once, without interfering\r\nwith system headers, upstream macros, or unity builds.

introducing wrappers for them in the curlx namespace:\r\n`curlx_fopen()`, `curlx_fdopen()`, `curlx_fclose()`.\r\n\r\nThe undefine/redefine/`(function)()` methods broke on systems\r\nimplementing these functions as macros. E.g. AIX 32-bit's `fopen()`.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n- rename `lib/fopen.*` to `lib/curl_fopen.*` (for `Curl_fopen()`)\r\n  to make room for the newly added `curlx/fopen.h`.\r\n- curlx: move file-related functions from `multibyte.c` to `fopen.c`.\r\n- tests/server: stop using the curl-specific `fopen()` implementation\r\n  on Windows. Unicode isn't used by runtests, and it isn't critical to\r\n  run tests on longs path. It can be re-enabled if this becomes\r\n  necessary, or if the wrapper receives a feature that's critical for\r\n  test servers.\r\n\r\nReported-by: Andrew Kirillov\r\nBug: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/18510#issuecomment-3274393640\r\n\r\nFollow-up to bf7375ecc50e857760b0d0a668c436e208a400bd #18503\r\nFollow-up to 9863599d69b79d290928a89bf9160f4e4e023d4e #18502\r\nFollow-up to 3bb5e58c105d7be450b667858d1b8e7ae3ded555 #17827\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] sort out checksrc.\r\n- [x] fix upaired `fopen`/`fclose` after macrofying.\r\n- [x] convert macros to curlx functions (macros?), e.g. `curlx_fopen()`.\r\n- [x] move `curlx_f*()` functions (macros) to `lib/curlx`?\r\n- [x] tests/server: apply `fopen()` override on Windows as done before this patch? → redefinition-hell again.\r\n- [x] tests/server: maybe switch to `curlx_fopen()` too to avoid the the symbol override on Windows?\r\n  or, do we need to the extra Windows functionality for servers (not critical ATM, but why not keep it?))?
