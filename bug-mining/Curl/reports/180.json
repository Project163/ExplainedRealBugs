Steps to reproduce\r\nIf you try to use the `-D/--dump-header <filename>` option, `curl` curl will have a segmentation fault\r\nif the file cannot be created (for instance if the target directory does not have the `w` permissions), for \r\ninstance: \r\n```bash\r\n$ mkdir hdr\r\n$ chmod -w hdr\r\n$ curl -D hdr/headers.dump https://google.com\r\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\r\n```\r\n### I expected the following\r\nOn older versions of `curl`, it just prints an error message and exits with rcode 23\r\n(the below is what happens with version 7.29.0):\r\n```\r\n$ /usr/bin/curl -D hdr/headers.dump https://google.com\r\nWarning: Failed to open hdr/headers.dump\r\n$ echo $?\r\n23\r\n```\r\n### curl/libcurl version + operationg systems\r\nI was able to reproduce with the following
