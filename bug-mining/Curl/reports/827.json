I did this\n\nQuickly review code handling temporary files and get renamed to final output files.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nThe code not to leak files on error code paths.\n\nIn particular this is the only location that unlinks the temporary file (`tempstore`) on error:\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/fa49c50ac359bc3ac7c76e86e0be0fe9a0cb6b7c/lib/cookie.c#L1598\n\nI think would be smarter to remove this line and move the unlink to `error:` section by adding:\n```\nif(tempstore)\n  unlink(tempstore);\n```\n\nI would have normally just PRd this but I'm a bit too busy atm.\n\n###
