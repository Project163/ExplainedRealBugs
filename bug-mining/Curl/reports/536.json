After a bit of investigation around `Curl_poll()`, I found that this is caused by the lack of the `HAVE_POLL_FINE` define in these builds.\r\n\r\nLooking at [CMake/OtherTests.cmake](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/a5682d9cb9da3212775bb227488a343d32552fd6/CMake/OtherTests.cmake#L79-L110) I see that there is indeed a check for `HAVE_POLL_FINE` inside a `if (NOT CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING)` condition.\r\n\r\nRemoving the `NOT CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING` check and replacing `check_c_source_runs()` with `check_c_source_compiles()` fixes this.\r\n\n\n### I expected the following\n\nProperly detection of `HAVE_POLL_FINE`.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\nlibcurl/8.10.0-DEV BearSSL nghttp2/1.61.0\n\n### operating system\n\nLinux rhel 3.10.0-1160.119.1.el7.tuxcare.els2.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Jul 15 12:09:18 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux","closed_by":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14714/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
