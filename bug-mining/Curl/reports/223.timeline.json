still the same for me, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nFor context, in case it's useful: I have an HTTP server which generates thumbnails for videos stored in cloud storage (e.g. OneDrive). It renders html that looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/xxpL7Iq). The video data is fetched using curl and then it is passed through to FFmpeg (through C API). When FFmpeg says: please read n bytes from the stream then I tell curl to fire a request and then as soon as n bytes are fetched I pause the connection, to avoid buffering. When FFmpeg asks for m more bytes I resume the connection.\r\n\r\nWith curl at head the first time I try to load the file list it works fine, very rarely it gets stuck on the last thumbnail. When I do a hard reload (to force thumbnail regeneration) it loads around 3 thumbnails and the rest are stuck; it's 100% reproducible.

It wraps `curl` into a coroutine interface. Compiling `coro-cloudstorage` with `vcpkg` will pull in all dependencies and build them from source:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir build \r\ncd build \r\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg-root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G Ninja\r\nninja\r\n./examples/cloudstorage\r\n```\r\nThe program will start a HTTP server on port 12345. Go to `localhost:12345` in the browser to use the app. Then you can use some throwaway account for whatever cloud and give the app access to it. Upload some video files there (through the official web ui of that cloud provider) and see the thumbnails being generated in the app when going to the file list. You can disable the usage of cloud provided thumbnails by removing the code [here](https://github.com/lemourin/coro-cloudstorage/blob/master/src/coro/cloudstorage/util/cloud_provider_handler.cc#L244-L255). It will force using `ffmpeg` to generate the thumbnails.\r\n\r\nThe app can also be built without `vcpkg`. Then `coro-http` would need to be installed manually. `vcpkg` will pull in its own curl so you'd probably need to do that. \r\n\r\nThe app can be compiled with `clang` or `msvc`; `gcc` is not supported because of broken coroutine support.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1519761586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lemourin","id":11277986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjc3OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11277986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin","html_url":"https://github.com/lemourin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9079774399,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c5jo2adzwAAAAIdMly_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/9079774399","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d585604efc01306a03f6d7747a70bf233f290fff","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/icing/curl/commits/d585604efc01306a03f6d7747a70bf233f290fff","created_at":"2023-04-24T10:42:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1519910491","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/10988#issuecomment-1519910491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10988","id":1519910491,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5al_5b","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-24T11:00:11Z","updated_at":"2023-04-24T11:00:11Z","body":"I updated #11005 with a fix to my current theory of what is going wrong in your case.\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/81b2b577df40262716ff0e1c0e1cebabb99f012d we introduced more restrictive HTTP/2 flow control windows for transfers. This has many benefits. But, in the case if pause/unpause transfers, it needs extra care.\r\n\r\nIn an event based app like yours, transfers are only run when socket events happen, or when curl timeouts trigger. The unpausing of a http/2 transfer did not trigger a timeout, but just relied on new DATA arriving and generating socket events.\r\n\r\nThis is not always the case. On a pause, we restrict the flow window to 0 and on unpause, we increase it again.  But the server will not always send more DATA. It can happen that, before it got the paused 0, it already send enough DATA to exhaust the window. Increasing the window again, the server will see that it still exhausts the newly enlarged window and not send anything.\r\n\r\nThis means no socket events and, without the curl timeout set, no events at all and the transfer stalls.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to always generate a timeout on unpausing, so the receive on the transfer *will* be made.\r\n\r\nI hope this works for you and catches the underlying issue.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1519910491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1520689803","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/10988#issuecomment-1520689803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10988","id":1520689803,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5ao-KL","user":{"login":"lemourin","id":11277986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjc3OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11277986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin","html_url":"https://github.com/lemourin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lemourin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-24T19:10:30Z","updated_at":"2023-04-24T19:10:30Z","body":"Thanks for the investigation!\r\n\r\n> With https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/81b2b577df40262716ff0e1c0e1cebabb99f012d we introduced more restrictive HTTP/2 ...\r\n\r\nYou mean https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/744dcf22fac6cf12a9112df106b61864982afef9 I suppose.\r\n\r\nI tried the updated PR.
