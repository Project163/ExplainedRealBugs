I think if wolfSSL can use the same paths as OpenSSL includes (@elms mentioned this in his PR) then we would want to check wolfSSL first, otherwise our OpenSSL section could include wolfSSL includes? If I understand this right. @vszakats do you remember the reason for the change to put OpenSSL

remember what was the exact error without this patch. But, is it really possible to use both wolfSSL and OpenSSL at the same time? In my tests this didn't seem to be the case, and they were conflicting. One (main) reason is that wolfSSL is supported by curl via its OpenSSL compatibility interface, sharing most (but not all) interface code.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to sort out inconsistencies when picking one over the other, but building against both at the same time I don't think is possible. It means a viable fix is to deselect one of them at build time.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The likely reason I had changed the order, is the comment at the top of `curl_ntlm_core.c` which specifies the expected priority order, `USE_OPENSSL` being the first on the list. I think the order should be synced with this also in `curl_ntlm_core.h`. [ Back then, after finding out these two are conflicting, I did sort this out at the build level, and may have skipped bumping into the header issue in further tests. ]\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2: When I added this priority list in 2017 (6f86022df26243cc8a035fe8b4c89033b6a04bc0), wolfSSL support wasn't present yet. When wolfSSL support was added later on, the list wasn't updated, so it's still missing from it.
