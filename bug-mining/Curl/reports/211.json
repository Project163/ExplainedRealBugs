(Yes, I do know this is experimental.)\r\n\r\n### What actually happened\r\nThe connection remained stable for a while, but then started ignoring data and using 100% cpu.  When this happened, curl_ws_recv was returning CURLE_OK, the recv parameter was set to 0, and the curl_ws_frame contained bytesleft of 0.  My code repeatedly processed these phantom frames and called curl_ws_recv again for the next one.\r\n\r\nThe verbose output leading up to the problem was:\r\n* WS: received 160 bytes payload (0 left, buflen was 332)\r\n* WS: 168 bytes left to decode\r\n* WS:235 received FIN bit 1\r\n* WS: received OPCODE TEXT\r\n* WS: received 163 bytes payload (0 left, buflen was 168)\r\n* WS: 1 bytes left to decode\r\n* WS: plen == 1, EAGAIN\r\n\r\nFollowing this, the last two lines were repeated indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI dug into this behavior and believe I have found the source of the problem in ws.c. When curl_ws_recv (https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/ws.c#L409) is called at the end of a frame (wsp->frame.bytesleft == 0) with one byte in the buffer (wsp->stillblen == 1):\r\n- curl_easy_recv on line 431 is not called due to the condition on line 428.\r\n- ws_decode on line 449 is called and returns CURLE_AGAIN since the buffer does not include enough bytes for a frame.\r\n- The break on line 453 results in return value of CURLE_OK with a buffer of length zero.\r\n- This repeats for each curl_ws_recv call.\r\n\r\nI fixed this locally by updating:\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/ws.c#L453\r\n`<        break;`\r\n`>        continue;`\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/ws.c#L428\r\n`<    if(!wsp->stillblen) {`\r\n`>    if(!wsp->stillblen || result == CURLE_AGAIN) {`\r\n\r\nSo far, this has seemed to work, but I'm sure you can come up with something better.\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\ncurl 7.88.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.88.1 OpenSSL/3.0.2 zlib/1.2.11\r\nRelease-Date: 2023-02-20\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS HSTS HTTPS-proxy IPv6 Largefile libz NTLM NTLM_WB SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\nLinux virt-linux 5.19.0-35-generic #36~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Feb 17 15:17:25 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10831/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
