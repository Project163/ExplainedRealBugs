I can confirm that I get the same error you see on `https://curl-neqo.neon.rocks:4433`. That is weird. I have a hard time testing, because installing curl with http3 support on the server is harder than on my dev machine. It's probably the different hostname that produces the weird server reply. So the hosted test server might be useless, unless I can modify it to ignore the sent hostname.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1863283753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mb","id":36711370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzExMzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36711370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb","html_url":"https://github.com/mb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1864277835","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12037#issuecomment-1864277835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12037","id":1864277835,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5vHp9L","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-20T11:02:04Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T11:02:04Z","body":"You can send a URL to localhost with `curl  --resolve curl-nego.neon.rocks:4433:127.0.0.1`.
