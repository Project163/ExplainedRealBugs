I did this\n\nCompile 8.12.0 on IBM i V7R4M0 system and got linker errors:\n```\nCPD5D02:  Definition not found for symbol 'showhelp'.\nCPD5D02:  Definition not found for symbol 'hugehelp'.\nCPF3C50:  Program CURL not created.\n```\nThis can be either reproduced when building without SSL support. If with SLL, then a workaround suggested in issue #16209 could be used.\n\nThis issue is introduced by the next commit:\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/96843f4ef74e02452972fd97fe15d8ff656f46ec\n\nHere `tool_hugehelp.c` was removed from `src/Makefile.inc`. However, IBMi `make-src.sh` build script collects source files to build using\n```\nget_make_vars Makefile.inc\n```\n\nAs we have `USE_MANUAL=\"'USE_MANUAL'\"`, the rest of the code expects `showhelp()`/`hugehelp()` to be there. But those are no longer included into the build, which makes linker unhappy.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nClean build\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\n8.12.0\n\n### operating system\n\nOS400
