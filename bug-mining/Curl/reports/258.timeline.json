Instead it returns `HYPER_TASK_EMPTY`. \r\n\r\nThe response sits undelivered inside the hyper stack. No socket activity is happening and curl's transfer loop checks much later again on the transfer, calling `hyper_executor_poll()` again. This does **not** do any network IO, but delivers the `HYPER_TASK_RESPONSE` right away.\r\n\r\nThis delays curls transfers significantly.\r\n\r\nPlease advice if you regard this as a bug in  hyper or advice how curl shall reliably work around this behaviour.
