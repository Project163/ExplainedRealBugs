doing a POST with `--digest` does an override on the initial request with `Content-Length: 0`, but the http2 filter was unaware of that and expected the originally request body. It did therefore not send a final DATA frame with EOF flag to the server.\r\n- The fix overrides any initial notion of post size when the `done_send` event is triggered by the transfer loop, leading to the EOF that is necessary.\r\n- refs #11194. The fault did not happen in testing, as Apache httpd never tries to read the request body of the initial request, sends the 401 reply and closes the stream. The server used in the reported issue however tried to read the EOF and timed out on the request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1561597383","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/11194#issuecomment-1561597383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11194","id":1561597383,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5dFBXH","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-24T16:56:21Z","updated_at":"2023-05-24T16:56:21Z","body":"Thanks for the fast reply.
