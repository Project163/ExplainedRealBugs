of a data ingestion component with Vector and the `exec` source, we discovered that Vector is leaking the `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variables (used by OpenSSL) to the child processes started by `exec`. Note that these variables are only independently overwritten by Vector if not previously set in the environment.\r\n\r\nIn our use case, we are using `curl` inside a shell script as the `exec` process and setting a custom `SSL_CERT_FILE` variable in the environment. While Vector passes the correct value down to the child process, it is also still passing the `SSL_CERT_DIR` variable as well.  Due to an [issue](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/11325) in `curl`, if both `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` are passed, `curl` will not honour `SSL_CERT_FILE`.\r\n\r\nWhile the actual bug is in `curl` by not honouring `SSL_CERT_FILE` alone, I think Vector should not be leaking those variables to child processes of `exec`, and instead should run the child process using the same environment in which Vector is running.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Potential Solution Discussion**\r\n\r\nThis behaviour was introduced in <https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/pull/904>, where the [`openssl-probe`](https://docs.rs/openssl-probe/0.1.5/openssl_probe/) crate was added to Vector and then [`init_ssl_cert_env_vars()`](https://docs.rs/openssl-probe/0.1.5/openssl_probe/fn.init_ssl_cert_env_vars.html) is called during Vector init to populate these variables for OpenSSL: <https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/blob/0f13b22a4cebbba000444bdb45f02bc820730a13/src/app.rs#L387C23-L392>\r\n\r\nThis is necessary because Vector is using the `vendored` feature of the [`openssl`](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.55/openssl/) crate, which does not load system CAs:\r\n> The vendored copy will not be configured to automatically find the system’s root certificates, but the openssl-probe crate can be used to do that instead.\r\n\r\nThere are three potential approaches to address the described problem:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of setting the `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` variables within Vector with `init_ssl_cert_env_vars()`, Vector could use the [`probe()`](https://docs.rs/openssl-probe/0.1.5/openssl_probe/fn.probe.html) function in `openssl-probe` which only probes suitable SSL CA file/dir locations on the system but does not actually set any variables itself. Then, with the probing results, Vector should configure OpenSSL directly.\r\n   * This is normally accomplished in OpenSSL by using the [`SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations()`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.html) function.\r\n   * Unfortunately, The `openssl` crate does not provide complete access to this function (see [source code](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.55/src/openssl/ssl/mod.rs.html#913-923)), because it only sets the `CAfile` argument and leaves `CApath` always set to null.\r\n\r\n2. For the `exec` source, Vector could unset `SSL_CERT_FILE` or `SSL_CERT_DIR` if and only if they were set by `init_ssl_cert_env_vars()` before launching the child process.\r\n   * The `openssl-probe` crate has a [`try_init_ssl_cert_env_vars()`](https://docs.rs/openssl-probe/0.1.5/openssl_probe/fn.try_init_ssl_cert_env_vars.html) function to help with this.\r\n\r\n      > Returns true if any certificate file or directory was found while probing. Combine this with has_ssl_cert_env_vars() to check whether previously configured environment variables are valid.\r\n\r\n   * A potential problem with this approach is that Vector would need to propagate this information (if the variables were set or not by `openssl-probe`) down to the `exec` source implementation.\r\n\r\n3. Vector can conditionally call `init_ssl_cert_env_vars()` if and only if `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` are not already present in the environment. This equivalent to Vector fully honouring those variables.\r\n    * The `openssl-probe` crate has a [`has_ssl_cert_env_vars()`](https://docs.rs/openssl-probe/0.1.5/openssl_probe/fn.has_ssl_cert_env_vars.html) function to easily accomplish this.\r\n\r\n      ```rust\r\n      if !openssl_probe::has_ssl_cert_env_vars() {\r\n          openssl_probe::init_ssl_cert_env_vars();\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   * This approach would still leak `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` into `exec` child proceses, but only if none of theme was already set in the environment. This is better than leaking one or the other partially.\r\n\r\nWhile approach (2) is the optimal solution, approach (3) could be a good-enough solution in the meantime.\n\n###
