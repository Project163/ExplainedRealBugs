Description of Problem:\r\n\r\nFails to download files via curl if http2 is used.

Apache is correct in its behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe question is now: is the libcurl application wrong in adding the header or should curl, when selecting HTTP/2, automatically strip the header from the request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenSCAP/openscap/issues/2193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenSCAP/openscap/issues/2193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"therikb31","id":79743296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NzQzMjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79743296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31","html_url":"https://github.com/therikb31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-15T11:13:46Z","updated_at":"2025-10-15T11:13:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open5gs/open5gs/issues/4110","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open5gs/open5gs","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open5gs/open5gs/issues/4110/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open5gs/open5gs/issues/4110/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open5gs/open5gs/issues/4110/events","html_url":"https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/4110","id":3517523962,"node_id":"I_kwDOBM4HkM7RqSf6","number":4110,"title":"Error in the HTTP2 framing layer observed sporadically on AMF causing UE registrations to fail","user":{"login":"therikb31","id":79743296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NzQzMjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79743296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31","html_url":"https://github.com/therikb31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therikb31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":5166283890,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBM4HkM8AAAABM-88cg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open5gs/open5gs/labels/Housekeeping:ToClose","name":"Housekeeping:ToClose","color":"006B75","default":false,"description":"Issues reviewed and closed.
