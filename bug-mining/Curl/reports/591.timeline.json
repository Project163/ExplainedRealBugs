fix socket/sockindex confusion on writes:\r\n\r\n  The callstack used to end with `Curl_write_plain()` accepting a socket\r\n  till 7.87.0.

Its callers\r\n  missed it and continued operating on sockets: `do_sec_send()`,\r\n  `sec_write()`, passing it down the stack and `Curl_conn_send()`\r\n  resolving it as if it was a sockindex.\r\n  It
