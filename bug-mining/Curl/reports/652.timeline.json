a \"cw-pause\" client writer in the PROTOCOL phase that buffers output when the client paused the transfer. This prevents content decoding from blowing the buffer in the \"cw-out\" writer.\r\n\r\nAdded test_02_35 that downloads 2 100MB gzip bombs in parallel and pauses after 1MB of decoded 0's.\r\n\r\nThis is a solution to issue #16280, with some limitations:\r\n- cw-out still needs buffering of its own, since it can be paused \"in the middle\" of a write that started with some KB of gzipped zeros and exploded into several MB of calls to cw-out.\r\n- cw-pause will then start buffering on its own *after* the write that caused the pause. cw-pause has no buffer limits, but the data it buffers is still content-encoded. Protocols like http/1.1 stop receiving, h2/h3 have window sizes, so the cw-pause buffer should not grow out of control, at least for these protocols.\r\n- the current limit on cw-out's buffer is ~75MB (for whatever historical reason). A potential content-encoding that blows 4KB (the cw-pause chunk size) into > 75MB would still blow the buffer, making the transfer fail. Current encoders do not seem capable of this.\r\n\r\nA better solution would be to allow CURLE_AGAIN handling in the client writer chain and make all content encoders handle that. This would stop explosion of encoding on a pause right away. But this is a large change of the deocoder operations.\r\n\r\nUpdate: when content decoding is happening, cw-pause writes body data in 4k chunks. This prevents\r\nlarger `Curl_client_write()` to blow up pause buffers (as seen with openssl quic and quiche).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16296/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2650772814","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16280#issuecomment-2650772814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16280","id":2650772814,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6d_5VO","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-11T13:04:46Z","updated_at":"2025-02-11T13:04:46Z","body":"I propose #16296 as fix for this.

bug I promised to report after https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16280 was fixed.\n\n# What is going wrong?\n\nCurl fails to send window size updates when large differences exist in HTTP/2 stream throughput when using pauses.\nThis then presents as the transfer getting deadlocked, since Curl fails to request more data with more window size.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nThe first transfer finishes, the second transfer has a *bunch* of bytes buffered up after its initial window size, and the receiver is slowly drip-feeding them out.\n\n```\n<...>\n!!
