So this means curl no longer supports the full dict protocol. You should mention this in your documentation and show in the --version output that dict protocol is only partial.  Or you can make an exception and allow the subset of commands in RFC2229.\r\n\r\nMind you, there is a [undocumented feature](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/dict) which allows the commands (which I didn't know before). Which is to replace \"\\<space\\>\" with \":\" e.g.:\r\n```\r\n $ curl dict://dict.org/SHOW:DB 2>/dev/null | head -n 5\r\n 220 dict.dict.org dictd 1.12.1/rf on Linux 4.19.0-10-amd64 <auth.mime> <163757157.16019.1673978319@dict.dict.org>\r\n 250 ok\r\n 110 166 databases present\r\n gcide \"The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48\"\r\n wn \"WordNet (r) 3.0 (2006)\" \r\n```\r\nFor me this workaround is good enough. But for 'curl' I think you should choose between the above two options.\r\nIf you want to ignore this issue (third option), at least the workaround is documented 🙂.
