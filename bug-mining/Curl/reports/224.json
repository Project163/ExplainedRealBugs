No progress at all until ~ 6.5 MiB are transfered.)\r\n\r\nIt works fine when curl is built with libssh2. (Progress meter updates at least once every second.)\r\n\r\nWhen looking into this I came to the conclusion, that the sftp transfer with libssh is done in blocking mode.\r\nThat means the do-while loop in readwrite_data() (lib/transfer.c)  runs until maxloops are exceeded. So depending on buffer size, there would be no updating on the progress meter for a long time.\r\n\r\nIs there any specific reason why libssh is used in blocking mode for this?\r\nCurl seems to prefer nonblocking mode in general.\r\nI tried to fix this by adding `sftp_file_set_nonblocking(sshc->sftp_file)` after `sftp_open()` and as far as I can tell this works without a problem.
