I am experiencing some [difficulties in Microsoft Git](https://github.com/microsoft/git/pull/799#issuecomment-3346304034) with the changes introduced by https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/18105, and reverting this PR \"fixes\" it.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `curl_multi_timeout()` (when being called in a test that intentionally tries to access a non-existing server by connecting to http://127.0.0.1:5799/ when nobody is listening on that port) changed behavior. Previously, it kept returning a timeout of -1. Now, the timeout is instead first set to 200ms (or 199ms, sometimes). The next two calls return 300 _seconds_ (i.e. _not_ milliseconds), and the next three calls repeat that sequence, causing my test case to fail for different reasons than the expected one.\r\n\r\nIs this by design? I could understand if the six attempts would now cause 200ms * 5 = one second of extra delay, but not an extra delay that had not been there before of more than 20 _minutes_.\r\n\r\nFWIW when I tried to debug this, I saw that the 300 seconds come from [the `Curl_timeleft()` call in the new `cf_ip_ballers_run()` call](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-8_16_0/lib/cf-ip-happy.c#L497), which [returns essentially the `DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-8_16_0/lib/connect.c#L148-L149). The stack trace when that happens looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#0  cf_ip_ballers_run (bs=0x27752d8, cf=0x2775390, data=0x2772900, connected=0x5ff687) at cf-ip-happy.c:498\r\n#1  0x00007ffb9c34bf1a in is_connected (cf=0x2775390, data=0x2772900, connected=0x5ff687) at cf-ip-happy.c:625\r\n#2  0x00007ffb9c34c511 in cf_ip_happy_connect (cf=0x2775390, data=0x2772900, done=0x5ff687) at cf-ip-happy.c:758\r\n#3  0x00007ffb9c35149a in Curl_conn_cf_connect (cf=0x2775390, data=0x2772900, done=0x5ff687) at cfilters.c:413\r\n#4  0x00007ffb9c355c7d in cf_setup_connect (cf=0x27750a0, data=0x2772900, done=0x5ff687) at connect.c:387\r\n#5  0x00007ffb9c3518b2 in Curl_conn_connect (data=0x2772900, sockindex=0, blocking=false, done=0x5ff687) at cfilters.c:498\r\n#6  0x00007ffb9c397268 in multi_runsingle (multi=0xfb8410, nowp=0x5ff710, data=0x2772900) at multi.c:2429\r\n#7  0x00007ffb9c397ccd in curl_multi_perform (m=0xfb8410, running_handles=0x5ff794) at multi.c:2758\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis amount is then dutifully added to the splay list, from where `curl_multi_timeout()` obtains it.\r\n\r\nI have verified that this is still an issue with the 81a919710 (GHA/linux-old: make one cmake v3.7.2 job verbose, 2025-09-28) (which was the latest revision on the `master` branch when I started investigating), Is this a bug, or do I now have to call cURL's API in a different way to get back the previous behavior?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @dscho in https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/18105#issuecomment-3346783779_","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18767/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
