netbsd is **not** to blame after all. They do copy the structure from userland to kernel memory properly. After the internal processing, the msghdr is copied back, but iovec are not (obviously, as they should not be touched).\n\nSo how come this is an issue in code that was derived from netbsd?\n\nWhen AmiTCP/IP was created in 1993, the peeps working on it took networking code from netbsd 0.9. Since AmigaOS has no separation between user and kernel memory, in their bout of optimisation, they removed some buffer copying and missed the distinction of iovec *not* being copied back to userland. Instead, they made the recvmsg/sendmsg pass the user-passed struct msghdr as-is to the internal engine doing the processing. This leads to the iovec being modified when it should not be.\n\nOops.\n\nSomehow, this went unnoticed for 32 years.
