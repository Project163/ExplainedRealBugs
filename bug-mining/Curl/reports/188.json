When `EPOLLIN` is signalled for an associated fd, I call the `curl_ws_recv` function. It works correctly in typical cases, however after auto-responding to a `PING` frame, it does not return. Looking into the branch at lib/ws.c:485, the issue seems to be that the outer loop does not terminate. Returning with `CURLE_AGAIN` seems to solve the problem. Subsequent frames are also received correctly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* we handled the data part of the PING, advance over that */\r\nwsp->stillb += nsent;\r\nwsp->stillblen -= nsent;\r\nreturn CURLE_AGAIN;\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10615/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
