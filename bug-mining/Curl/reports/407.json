The OpenSSL documentation states that the caller should retry the call is the return value is less than zero, as long as the SSL error is SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT WRITE. For me the following replacement code solved the issue:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nint res = SSL_read(  backend->handle, buf, sizeof buf);\r\nint error = SSL_get_error(  backend->handle, res );\r\nif (SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL != error) {\r\n   int res = 0;\r\n   while (res = (SSL_shutdown( backend->handle )) < 0) {\r\n      error = SSL_get_error( backend->handle, res );\r\n      if (error != SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ \r\n    && error  !SSL_ERROR_WANT ) \r\n        break;\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n[curl -V output]\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nWIndows for both Client and Server.\r\n\r\n<!-- On Unix please post the output of \"uname -a\" -->\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11383/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
