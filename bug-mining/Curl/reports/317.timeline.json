Therefore the loop never moves the \"auth\" pointer further.\r\nTo confirm that, I added empty statement \"{ }\" as a possible workaround between last #endif and \"while\" (before line 1144) and it fixed the problem.\r\nSo the problem isn't related to HTTP/2 but to --disable-bearer-auth; disabling bearer auth leaves unwanted \"else\" right before the code which advances the loop further.\r\nStrictly speaking, since --disable-bearer-auth is an option introduced in 8.3.0, maybe I shouldn't call this a
