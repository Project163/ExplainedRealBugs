Going forward, using this attribute we should be able to write test cases using linefeeds only and avoid mixed line ending encodings.\r\n\r\nFixes #10009","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10010/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1333433080","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/10009#issuecomment-1333433080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10009","id":1333433080,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5PepL4","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-01T08:56:50Z","updated_at":"2022-12-01T08:56:50Z","body":"> The conversion could then be done explicitly without caring if it looks like HTTP or not.\r\n\r\nEh, no.
