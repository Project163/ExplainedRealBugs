If so, I think it would be nice to fix this :-)\n\nThe current implementation looks the same as when gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2 was first introduced 10 years ago, back then, it was relatively new, and falling back to gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file, which does not support pkcs11 was reasonable.  I think we can now make curl always use gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2679953063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tatsuhiro-t","id":404610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDYxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/404610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t","html_url":"https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatsuhiro-t/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16452526441,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c6pNplPzwAAAAPUpaFp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/16452526441","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"336fa4e951f7eceb4db302aed5f22c56279ca6b6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/icing/curl/commits/336fa4e951f7eceb4db302aed5f22c56279ca6b6","created_at":"2025-02-25T09:33:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-25T09:33:27Z","updated_at":"2025-02-25T09:33:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16472","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16472/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16472/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16472/events","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/16472","id":2877753777,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAiu0c6Mb8Hv","number":16472,"title":"gnutls,
