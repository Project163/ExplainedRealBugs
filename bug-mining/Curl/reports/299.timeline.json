I found that before deciding to do redirection(Curl_follow), libcurl will execute the `multi_done` function, which will execute to `curl_http_done`, thereby cleaning up the resources pointed to by your newly added `formp` ptr, `formp` and `data->state.mimepost` point to the same address, and then cause seekfunc be a wild pointer.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1681707709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yushicheng7788","id":52878843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODc4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52878843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788","html_url":"https://github.com/yushicheng7788","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yushicheng7788/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1681722652","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/11680#issuecomment-1681722652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11680","id":1681722652,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5kPQ0c","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-17T06:49:21Z","updated_at":"2023-08-17T06:49:21Z","body":"Can

very sorry, I can't provide detailed code due to privacy issues, but the specific details can be summarized as using curl_formadd() to send files, the server needs to return 307 redirection.

When the state machine is in the MSTATE_DO state, the multi_do function will store the form data in data->state.formp, data->state.formp will also make a copy to data->state.mimepost, and then the state machine will transfer to the MSTATE_DID state . This state will be further transferred to the MSTATE_PERFORMING state. In this state, if the location field is found in the response header, it will be redirected (data->req.newurl not NULL). But before the state machine transfers to MSTATE_CONNECT, the multi_done function will be executed, which will clean up data->state.formp. But data->state.formp and data->state.mimepost share the same piece of memory, and data->state.mimepost will be used in rewind, but the resources it points to have been released, resulting in wild pointers. Hope the clues I found can help you.
