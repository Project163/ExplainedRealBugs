I did this\n\n### Description\r\nOur project uses libuv and curl for network communication. The application spawns many threads, with each thread using libuv and curl. As a result, the total file descriptor (fd) usage is quite high, peaking above 1024. We used setrlimit to increase the maximum number of fds to 32768. However, in curl, the internal limit is set by FD_SETSIZE to 1024, leading to an issue.\r\n\r\nIn curl's select.h at line 1024, FD_SETSIZE is used as the fd limit. This causes VERIFY_SOCK in select.c to set the global errno via SET_SOCKERRNO when fd exceeds FD_SETSIZE.\r\n\r\nThis exception causes SOCKET_WRITABLE(ctx->sock, 0) at line 1346 in cf-socket.c to return a non-zero rc, leading to the error branch at line 1363. The call to verifyconnect(ctx->sock, &ctx->error) at line 1364 ignores the return value, causing a normal connection to be mistakenly treated as an error, resulting in CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT at line 1365.\r\n\r\nFrom the application's perspective, the network is normal, but curl continuously returns CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nCreate an application that uses libuv and curl in multiple threads.\r\nIncrease the maximum number of file descriptors to 32768 using setrlimit.\r\nObserve that curl returns CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT when fd usage peaks above 1024.\r\nExpected Behavior\r\ncurl should handle file descriptors above 1024 correctly and not return CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT erroneously.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\ncurl returns CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT due to the FD_SETSIZE limit being exceeded.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\nHere are the relevant code links:\r\n\r\nselect.h (line 1024): https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/select.h\r\nselect.c (VERIFY_SOCK): https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/select.c\r\ncf-socket.c (lines 1346-1365): https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/cf-socket.c\n\n### I expected the following\n\n# #https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/cf-socket.c 1352\r\n```\r\nelse if((rc & CURL_CSELECT_ERR) || rc == CURL_CSELECT_OUT || cf->conn->bits.tcp_fastopen) {\r\n    if(verifyconnect(ctx->sock, &ctx->error)) {\r\n      /* we are connected with TCP, awesome! */\r\n      ctx->connected_at = Curl_now();\r\n      set_local_ip(cf, data);\r\n      *done = TRUE;\r\n      cf->connected = TRUE;\r\n      CURL_TRC_CF(data, cf, \"connected\");\r\n      return CURLE_OK;\r\n    }\r\n    if (rc & CURL_CSELECT_ERR) {\r\n      result = CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n# #https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/select.h 106\r\n```\r\n#define VERIFY_SOCK(x) do {                     \\\r\n    if(!VALID_SOCK(x)) {      \\\r\n      SET_SOCKERRNO(EINVAL);                    \\\r\n      return -1;                                \\\r\n    }                                           \\\r\n  } while(0)\r\n#endif\r\n```\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\nmaster and 8.10.0\n\n### operating system\n\nAndroid and iOS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17418995732,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c6XfYnazwAAAAQOQMgU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/17418995732","actor":{"login":"pps83","id":1614246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1614246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83","html_url":"https://github.com/pps83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4c0fb09af95616362d2d3b32bb72b95852edf7d1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pps83/curl/commits/4c0fb09af95616362d2d3b32bb72b95852edf7d1","created_at":"2025-04-26T22:32:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
