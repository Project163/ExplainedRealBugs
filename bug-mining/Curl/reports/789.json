After all payload bytes are sent, the server sends one more frame with the FIN bit set but with a 0-byte payload (which seems to be allowed by the RFC).\n\nOn the client side (using libcurl), we receive all fragments with the CONT opcode and keep waiting for one more frame — but it never arrives. If the server then starts sending a new message, the client receives both messages combined into one.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nlibcurl should treat the 0-byte FIN frame as the end of the fragmented message, update its ws_meta state accordingly, and call the CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION callback (possibly with a 0-byte payload) to signal message completion.\n\nI’m not sure if delivering an explicit 0-byte callback is the correct approach, but without some form of callback, there’s no way to detect message boundaries in this case.\n\n\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\n8.13.0\n\n### operating system\n\nAndroid/Linux","closed_by":{"login":"andriydruk","id":1927559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjc1NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1927559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk","html_url":"https://github.com/andriydruk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriydruk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18286/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
