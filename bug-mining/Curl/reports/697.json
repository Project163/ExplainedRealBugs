Some editors automatically add a trailing newline, so you might have to disable that.\n\nWhen running `curl --config curl-config.txt`, the verbose output indicates that curl sent a POST request without any body, ignoring the `data` instruction:\n\n```\n> POST / HTTP/1.1\n> Host: example.com\n> User-Agent: curl/8.12.1\n> Accept: */*\n> \n* Request completely sent off\n< HTTP/1.1 411 Length Required\n< Mime-Version: 1.0\n< Content-Type: text/html\n< Content-Length: 326\n< Cache-Control: max-age=0\n< Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:24:31 GMT\n< Connection: close\n< \n<HTML><HEAD>\n<TITLE>Bad Request</TITLE>\n</HEAD><BODY>\n[...]\n```\n\nI discovered that the last line in the configuration is ignored when there is no trailing newline and the last line's length is a multiple of 127. It happens for lines of 254, 381, 508 etc.\n\nIf a trailing newline is added or one `x` is added/removed, curl properly includes the body:\n\n```\n> POST / HTTP/1.1\n> Host: example.com\n> User-Agent: curl/8.12.1\n> Accept: */*\n> Content-Length: 117\n> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n> \n* upload completely sent off: 117 bytes\n< HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\n< Mime-Version: 1.0\n< Content-Type: text/html\n< Content-Length: 361\n< Cache-Control: max-age=0\n< Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:36:13 GMT\n< Connection: close\n< \n```\n\n### I expected the following\n\nCurl should send a request with a non-empty body.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\n```\ncurl 8.12.1 (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.12.1 OpenSSL/3.3.3 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.6 libidn2/2.3.7 libpsl/0.21.5 libssh2/1.11.1 nghttp2/1.64.0\nRelease-Date: 2025-02-13\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n```\n\nI confirmed that the bug is present in the current master branch. It was not present in curl 8.7.1. Bisecting the changes between these versions led me to believe that https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/d8618f4d8480a8aa245c14f9cf3f1bcab92846c1 introduce the regression. The commit introduced a buffer of size 128, which is suspiciously close to the magic length of 127.\n\n### operating system\n\n`Linux 5.19.0-46-generic #47-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Jun 16 13:33:58 UTC 2023 aarch64 GNU/Linux`","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
