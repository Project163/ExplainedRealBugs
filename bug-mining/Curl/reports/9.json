This specification deprecates such\r\n   line folding except within the message/http media type\r\n   ([Section 8.3.1](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7230.html#section-8.3.1)).\r\n   A sender MUST NOT generate a message that includes\r\n   line folding (i.e., that has any field-value that contains a match to\r\n   the obs-fold rule) unless the message is intended for packaging\r\n   within the message/http media type.\r\n   [...]\r\n   A user agent that receives an obs-fold in a response message that is\r\n   not within a message/http container MUST replace each received\r\n   obs-fold with one or more SP octets prior to interpreting the field\r\n   value.\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nI found this regression with a test suite of libisds project. That project took the multi-line headers from a specification of a protocol it implements. Checking the latest specification of the protocol, the multi-line headers were replaced with single-line headers.\r\n\r\nStill, would you consider restoring the old behavior? Or at least ignoring the consequent lines of the multi-lined headers as recommended with RFC 7230?","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/8844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/8844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
