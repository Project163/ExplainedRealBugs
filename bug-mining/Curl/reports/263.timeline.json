Problem\n\nHi, I'm sorry if this is not proper place to post this. I've recently tried to use new Azure Artifacts private registry feature. I've setup cargo configuration as per instructions and tried to publish a sample crate. Unfortunately I've got following error (hid specific names):\r\n```\r\n❯ cargo publish --dry-run --registry <REGISTRY> --package <PACKAGE>\r\n    Updating `<REGISTRY>` index\r\nwarning: spurious network error (3 tries remaining): [55] Failed sending data to the peer (Failed sending HTTP request)\r\nwarning: spurious network error (2 tries remaining): [55] Failed sending data to the peer (Failed sending HTTP request)\r\nwarning: spurious network error (1 tries remaining): [55] Failed sending data to the peer (Failed sending HTTP request)\r\nerror: download of config.json failed\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  failed to download from `https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<REGISTRY>/_packaging/<REGISTRY>/Cargo/index/config.json`\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  [55] Failed sending data to the peer (Failed sending HTTP request)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I noted that cargo uses curl underneath and so tried to perform the request manually, using the same token I provided to cargo login, I'll note here that its size is about 10KB which could matter. Here is the result with newer version installed with homebrew:\r\n```\r\n❯ curl --version\r\ncurl 8.4.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin22.6.0) libcurl/8.4.0 (SecureTransport) OpenSSL/3.1.4 zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.5 libidn2/2.3.4 libssh2/1.11.0 nghttp2/1.58.0 librtmp/2.3 OpenLDAP/2.6.6\r\nRelease-Date: 2023-10-11\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz MultiSSL NTLM SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\r\n\r\n❯ curl --location 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<REGISTRY>/_packaging/<REGISTRY>/Cargo/index/config.json' \\\r\n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>'\r\n{\"dl\":\"https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<REGISTRY>/_packaging/<GUID>/cargo/api/v1/crates/{crate}/{version}/download\",\"api\":\"https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<REGISTRY>/_packaging/<GUID>/cargo\",\"auth-required\":true}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd below is the result with system provided curl which seems to be the same (libcurl) version as in `cargo version`:\r\n```\r\n❯ /usr/bin/curl --version\r\ncurl 8.1.2 (x86_64-apple-darwin22.0) libcurl/8.1.2 (SecureTransport) LibreSSL/3.3.6 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.51.0\r\nRelease-Date: 2023-05-30\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz MultiSSL NTLM NTLM_WB SPNEGO SSL threadsafe UnixSockets\r\n\r\n❯ /usr/bin/curl --location 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<REGISTRY>/_packaging/<REGISTRY>/Cargo/index/config.json' \\\r\n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>'\r\ncurl: (55) Failed sending HTTP request\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is, can I somehow fix this given my setup or is there some deeper issue here.\n\n### Steps\n\n_No response_\n\n### Possible Solution(s)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Notes\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\n```text\ncargo 1.75.0-nightly (b4d18d4bd 2023-10-31)\r\nrelease: 1.75.0-nightly\r\ncommit-hash: b4d18d4bd3db6d872892f6c87c51a02999b80802\r\ncommit-date: 2023-10-31\r\nhost: aarch64-apple-darwin\r\nlibgit2: 1.7.1 (sys:0.18.1 vendored)\r\nlibcurl: 8.1.2 (sys:0.4.68+curl-8.4.0 system ssl:(SecureTransport) LibreSSL/3.3.6)\r\nssl: OpenSSL 1.1.1u  30 May 2023\r\nos: Mac OS 13.6.2 [64-bit]\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/13041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/13041/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12270304199,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c5qzmBvzwAAAALbXfvH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/12270304199","actor":{"login":"pghmcfc","id":947224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NzIyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/947224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc","html_url":"https://github.com/pghmcfc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pghmcfc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4e88024f0cda6674a91d3e7068e775edc5682f3b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pghmcfc/curl/commits/4e88024f0cda6674a91d3e7068e775edc5682f3b","created_at":"2024-03-27T18:20:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
