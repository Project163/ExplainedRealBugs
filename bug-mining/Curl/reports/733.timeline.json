That is fixed now, and the complete trace is included below.\n\nOne important observation that I found is that if I have a slow debug handler function, then the issue resolves itself.\nThis is the reason why I had to rewrite the way I collect the trace output (see modified code below). If I simply write directly to the debug output, then the code works. So I had to instead write to memory and then print out the trace after the test has failed.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Modified reproducing code where trace is now included after the reset</summary>\n\n```C#\nusing System.Text;\nusing Utiliread.Curl;\nusing Utiliread.Curl.Internal;\nusing static Interop.LibCurl;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Curl version: \" + Curl.GetVersion());\n\nconst string URL = \"ftp://ftpserver.com:21/\";\nconst string FTP_USERNAME = \"ftpuser\";\nconst string FTP_PASSWORD = \"ftppassword\";\nconst string PROXY_USERNAME = \"proxyuser\";\nconst string PROXY_PASSWORD = \"proxypassword\";\nconst string PROXY_HOST = \"proxy.com\";\nconst int PROXY_PORT = 1080;\n\nstatic CurlWriteResult Receive(ReadOnlySpan<byte> data)\n{\n    return data.Length;\n}\n\nstatic void Configure(CurlEasy easy)\n{\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.DEBUGFUNCTION, (curl_debug_callback)DebugConsole.DebugFunction);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.VERBOSE, 1);\n\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.URL, URL, Encoding.Latin1);\n\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.USE_SSL, CurlUseSsl.All);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 1);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.SSLVERSION, CurlSslVersion.CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_TLSv1_2);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.SSL_OPTIONS, (int)CURLSSLoption.CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA);\n\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.USERNAME, FTP_USERNAME, Encoding.UTF8);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.PASSWORD, FTP_PASSWORD, Encoding.UTF8);\n\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.PROXYTYPE, CurlProxyType.Socks5);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.PROXY, PROXY_HOST, Encoding.UTF8);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.PROXYPORT, PROXY_PORT);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.PROXYUSERPWD, $\"{PROXY_USERNAME}:{PROXY_PASSWORD}\", Encoding.UTF8);\n}\n\ncurl_global_trace(\"all\");\n\n// WORKS WITH TWO EASY HANDLES\n\nDebugConsole.DebugLines.Add(\"***** Running MLSD on first handle *****\");\n\nusing (var easy = new CurlEasy())\n{\n    Configure(easy);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.CUSTOMREQUEST, \"MLSD\", Encoding.ASCII);\n    easy.WriteFunction = Receive;\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.NOPROGRESS, 0);\n\n    try\n    {\n        easy.Perform();\n    }\n    catch (CurlException e) when (e.CURLcode == CURLcode.FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE)\n    {\n        // Expected\n    }\n}\n\nDebugConsole.DebugLines.Add(\"***** Running LIST on second handle *****\");\n\nusing (var easy = new CurlEasy())\n{\n    Configure(easy);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.CUSTOMREQUEST, \"LIST\", Encoding.ASCII);\n    easy.WriteFunction = Receive;\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.NOPROGRESS, 0);\n\n    easy.Perform(); // Does not throw, i.e. SUCCESS\n}\n\n// DOES NOT WORK WITH ONE REUSED EASY HANDLE\n\nDebugConsole.DebugLines.Add(\"***** Running MLSD on handle *****\");\n\nusing (var easy = new CurlEasy())\n{\n    Configure(easy);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.CUSTOMREQUEST, \"MLSD\", Encoding.ASCII);\n    easy.WriteFunction = Receive;\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.NOPROGRESS, 0);\n\n    try\n    {\n        easy.Perform();\n    }\n    catch (CurlException e) when (e.CURLcode == CURLcode.FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE)\n    {\n        // Expected\n    }\n\n    DebugConsole.DebugLines.Add(\"***** Running LIST on reused handle *****\");\n\n    // Reset and reuse\n    easy.Reset();\n    Configure(easy);\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.CUSTOMREQUEST, \"LIST\", Encoding.ASCII);\n    easy.WriteFunction = Receive;\n    easy.SetOpt(CURLoption.NOPROGRESS, 0);\n\n    try\n    {\n        easy.Perform();\n    }\n    catch (CurlException ex) when (ex.CURLcode == CURLcode.FTP_WEIRD_PASV_REPLY)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"!!!
