If not, then curl_ws_recv has to be called again to receive more\ndata.\n\nMy gut feeling is that the assert in the code isn't right (this is\nexperimental, after all) but I'm not really familiar with the WebSocket\nsupport. Does the problem go away if you increase the size of buffer? Could you\nenable debug logging and show what you get?\n\nI don't quite see how the existing logic in curl_ws_recv is supposed to work.\nIf ws_decode decodes a full frame, oleft (and therefore wsp->frame.bytesleft)\nwill be 0 and the decoded data length datalen will be >0, so the assertion\nDEBUGASSERT(wsp->frame.bytesleft >= datalen) will of course fail. At the point\nof the assert, wsp->frame.bytesleft already contains only the remaining bytes\nso the subtraction bytesleft -= datalen two lines down (as well as the assert\nthat's protecting the subtraction) shouldn't be necessary.
