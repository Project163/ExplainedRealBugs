I did this\n\nReading the manpage and trying to use options directly even though they were not documented (to see if it was just a documentation oversight), followed by reading the source code (to confirm whether I simply guessed the option name incorrectly) confirms that there is incomplete mirroring between the TLS options (`--tlsv1`, `--tlsv1.0`, `--tlsv1.1`, `...`, `--tls-max`, `--curves`) and their proxy counterparts (`--proxy-tlsv1`, `...`).\r\n\r\nIn fact, the latter option (`--proxy-tlsv1`) is the only one implemented, leaving you unable to e.g. instruct curl to use only TLSv1.3 when talking to an HTTPS CONNECT proxy itself.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nIt would be feature-complete to also have the following options:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--proxy-tls-max\r\n--proxy-tlsv1.0\r\n--proxy-tlsv1.1\r\n--proxy-tlsv1.2\r\n--proxy-tlsv1.3\r\n--proxy-curves\r\n```\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\n```\r\ncurl 8.4.0
