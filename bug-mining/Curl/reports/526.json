The list does indeed shows, but only up to message number 96. Then the display stops in the middle of the line, like here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[previous lines skipped]\r\n90 8157\r\n91 7650\r\n92 7888\r\n93 7779\r\n94 19238\r\n95 19218\r\n9\r\n```\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, after at least 30 seconds of inactivity, curl continues. It completes the truncated line and writes all remaining lines with no further delay (up to message 222, in my case).\r\n\r\nI have seen the same delay in other pop3 contexts, but I am not able to reproduce it there.
