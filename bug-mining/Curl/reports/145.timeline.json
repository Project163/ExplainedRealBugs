Thanks.\r\n\r\n@icing thank you for your quick response.\r\n\r\nBecause in my project(mobile products), i don't config STRING_SSL_CAPATH and STRING_SSL_CAFILE,\r\notherwise I use SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(through CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION callback to get ssl_ctx) \r\nto verify server peer tls cert.In this way I can use system api(like 'SecTrust' api on ios) to verify server cert, and also\r\ni can provide callback for others(who use my product) to verify server tls certs.\r\n\r\n**but in lib/vquic/ngtcp.c** \r\nif i not config STRING_SSL_CAPATH and STRING_SSL_CAFILE,  SSL_VERIFY_PEER is not set.\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vquic/ngtcp2.c#L273-L301\r\n\r\n**and in lib/vtls/openssl.c** \r\nSSL_VERIFY_PEER is only controlled by the verifypeer parameter(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER)\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3780-L3785\r\n\r\nand SSL_VERIFY_PEER is not binding with STRING_SSL_CAPATH and STRING_SSL_CAFILE\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3258-L3287\r\n\r\nso I think the code logic of openssl and ngtcp about SSL_VERIFY_PEER should be consistent。\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1373094635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"violetlige","id":9440781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NDA3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9440781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige","html_url":"https://github.com/violetlige","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/violetlige/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8165689227,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c5ag8s6zwAAAAHmtoeL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8165689227","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-06T03:23:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8165689229,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c5ag8s6zwAAAAHmtoeN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8165689229","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-06T03:23:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8167245588,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c5ag8s6zwAAAAHmzkcU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8167245588","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"747b6f3a62be32d55c76c1c19627d0883895f89d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/icing/curl/commits/747b6f3a62be32d55c76c1c19627d0883895f89d","created_at":"2023-01-06T08:42:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8168251308,"node_id":"COE_lADOAAiu0c5ag8s6zwAAAAHm3Z-s","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8168251308","actor":{"login":"bagder
