If OpenSSL is its own DLL (like in this case) then it calls the function beforehand and if it's a static library then it doesn't. The function should be called at least once per thread to prevent a memory leak. We make a call regardless and I think that was because we don't know if OpenSSL is part of the current module (like whether OpenSSL is its own DLL or part of some other DLL like libcurl or a DLL that contains static libcurl and static openssl).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2855432828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17541874227,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c61ZhuJzwAAAAQVk8Iz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/17541874227","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-06T17:49:52Z","label":{"name":"crash","color":"bfe5bf"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17541874239,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c61ZhuJzwAAAAQVk8I_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/17541874239","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-06T17:49:52Z","label":{"name":"TLS","color":"bfdadc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17541874245,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c61ZhuJzwAAAAQVk8JF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/17541874245","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-06T17:49:52Z","label":{"name":"Windows","color":"0e8a16"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2855538601","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/17262#issuecomment-2855538601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17262","id":2855538601,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6qNA-p","user":{"login":"Berrysoft","id":3758
