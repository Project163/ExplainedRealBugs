But, there seems to be no way to fix these in most cases, because the callback types are either part of the public curl APIs, or part of public external APIs. In `url.c` it may be possible to wrap fwrite/fread in internal functions to match the signature exactly, but it's even more noise (and runtime perf hit) with no benefit for current code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18477/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3253897609","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/18470#issuecomment-3253897609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18470","id":3253897609,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c7B8omJ","user":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-04T14:04:04Z","updated_at":"2025-09-07T10:50:07Z","body":"llvm
