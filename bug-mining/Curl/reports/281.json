Also \"-lssh2\" appears twice (some other libraries like ssl+crypto, zstd, z, and brotlidec also appear multiple times for some reason, but that doesn't trigger warnings at least.)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./configure \\\r\n\t--prefix=/usr/local/mystuff/curl/8.2.1 \\\r\n\t--with-openssl \\\r\n\t--with-libssh2 \\\r\n\t--with-brotli \\\r\n\t…\r\n```\r\n\r\n->\r\n\r\n```\r\n…\r\nconfigure: using LIBS: -lcares -lnghttp2 -lidn2 -lrtmp -lz -lssl -lcrypto -lssh2 -L/usr/local/mystuff/libssh2/latest/lib -lssh2 -lssl -lcrypto -lssl -lcrypto -lzstd -lzstd -lbrotlidec -lbrotlidec -lz -lpsl -lgsasl\r\nconfigure: LIBS note: LIBS should only be used to specify libraries (-lname).\r\nconfigure: WARNING: Continuing even with errors mentioned immediately above this line.\r\n…\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe specifications only can get generated via the pkg-config system (I only hotlink the .pc files in `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig`, and nothing else directly in the standard paths). So I'm guessing the configure script itself causes the problem. Maybe it is not using the correct `--libs-only-l`?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pkg-config --libs libssh2\r\n-L/usr/local/mystuff/libssh2/latest/lib -lssh2\r\n\r\n$ pkg-config --libs-only-l libssh2\r\n-lssh2\r\n\r\n$ pkg-config --libs-only-L libssh2\r\n-L/usr/local/mystuff/libssh2/latest/lib\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pretty matches what other libs, like nghttp2, etc., are providing there too. And those don't trigger this faux pas. \n\n### I expected the following\n\n```\r\n…\r\nconfigure: using LIBS: -lcares -lnghttp2 -lidn2 -lrtmp -lssl -lcrypto -lssh2 -lzstd -lbrotlidec -lz -lpsl -lgsasl\r\n…\r\n```\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.2.1\n\n### operating system\n\nMac OS X 10.10.5 (Yosemite)","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11538/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
