will now also compute the content-length of the transfer if stdin is the file to upload and stdin is a regular file, using its file size.\r\n\r\nSince, while being a regular file, stdin could not have its offset at the start of the file, curl will now also get the current offset into the upload file's file descriptor and use (filesize - offset) as content-length for transfer instead of just using the full filesize. This also fixes a bug on BSDs where open(\"/dev/fd/N\") behaves like dup(N), so, if N is a file descriptor to a regular file, the file offset of the file descriptor returned by open() may not have been at the start of the file despite curl's previous assumption.\r\n\r\nSince I don't know anything about VMS systems, I left the behaviour for VMS unchanged; on VMS, curl will still perform a chunked transfer if the upload file is stdin.\r\n\r\nFixes #12171\r\nFixes #12177\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ wc -c ~/.bashrc\r\n782\r\n$ sed 1d ~/.bashrc | wc
