Including these security rules will help developers identify potential security issues more effectively during testing.\r\n\r\nI will provide a list of APIs requiring checks along with their corresponding parameters：\r\n| API | parameter index (begin with 1) | URL |\r\n|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|\r\n| curl_easy_escape | 2 | https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_escape.html |\r\n| curl_multi_perform| 2 | https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_multi_perform.html |","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
