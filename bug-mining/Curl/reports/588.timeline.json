builds with CMake configured to falsely return successful detection\r\nwhen using `check_function_exists()` (and `check_library_exists()`, and\r\nanything based on `try_compile()` that's relying on the linker). After\r\nsuch mis-detection the build fails when trying to use the feature that\r\ndoesn't in fact exist.\r\n\r\nThe mis-detection is caused by this CMake setting:\r\n```\r\nset(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE STATIC_LIBRARY)\r\n```\r\nIt is set by default (or on conditions) when using 3rd-party toolchain:\r\nhttps://github.com/leetal/ios-cmake/blob/master/ios.toolchain.cmake\r\n\r\nAfter this patch the curl build overrides this setting for the duration\r\nof feature tests, and logs a message about it.\r\n\r\nAlso preset and skip feature tests for known mis-detections:\r\n- `connect()` in `libsocket`\r\n- `getpass_r()`\r\n- `eventfd()` (did not cause an issue due to a separate bug)\r\n- `sendmmsg()` (did not cause an issue because it's Linux-only)\r\n\r\nIf mis-detections are still seen, the workaround is to force-set the\r\nspecific feature by passing `-DHAVE_*=OFF` to cmake.\r\nAlso consider passing `-DENABLE_STRICT_TRY_COMPILE=ON` for\r\n`ios.toolchain.cmake` to fix the root cause.\r\n\r\nInterestingly curl itself uses this setting to speed up compile-only\r\ndetections: be17f298ff508d62d493d4a8d43e56a1e2861a50 #3744\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n- OtherTests.cmake: restore original value of\r\n  `CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE`. Before this patch it reset it\r\n  to empty.\r\n- OtherTests.cmake: unset a local variable after use, quote a string.\r\n\r\nFollow-up to 8e345057761a8f796403923a96f2c8fd3edca647 #15164\r\nFollow-up
