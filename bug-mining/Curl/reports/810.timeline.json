PR fixes three robustness issues in the HTTP/3 (ngtcp2/nghttp3) path:\r\n\r\nStream leak on submit failure\r\nAfter successfully opening a QUIC bidi stream, if nghttp3_conn_submit_request() fails, the code left the QUIC stream open. We now call cf_ngtcp2_stream_close() to cancel the just-opened stream and flush egress, preventing a leaked stream on the wire. Note: used_bidi_streams remains monotonic by design and is not decremented.\r\n\r\nIncorrect stream marked as QUIC-flow-blocked\r\nWhen ngtcp2_conn_writev_stream() returns NGTCP2_ERR_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED, the code previously marked quic_flow_blocked on the transfer associated with x->data, which may not correspond to stream_id. We now look up the correct Curl_easy via ngtcp2_conn_get_stream_user_data(stream_id), mark that stream’s context, and nudge the multi with Curl_multi_mark_dirty().\r\n\r\nUndefined error returned from nghttp3 callback\r\ncb_h3_recv_header() returned -1 on errors, which is not a defined nghttp3 error code. We now return NGHTTP3_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE so nghttp3 can correctly classify and handle the failure.\r\n\r\nNote: These patches were created with LLMs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18904/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20135965272,"node_id":"AE_lADOAAiu0c7QDlQ-zwAAAASwMnJY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20135965272","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-07T09:10:08Z","assignee":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20136452242,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c7QDlQ-zwAAAASwOeCS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20136452242","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"355df8c6f19cd77862edb84b155e70b152ace097","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/icing/curl/commits/355df8c6f19cd77862edb84b155e70b152ace097","created_at":"2025-10-07T09:32:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-07T09:33:03Z","updated_at":"2025-10-07T09:33:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18906","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18906/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18906/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/rep
