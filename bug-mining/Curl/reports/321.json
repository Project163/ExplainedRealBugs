However, this preprocessor variable was not defined. The CMake variables ENABLE_STATIC and CPPFLAG_CURL_STATICLIB (which is the empty string if no static libs are to be built) don't seem to have an effect when using CMake for Visual Studio project generation - they only seem to have an effect on the autoconf files. Maybe, a line such as\r\n``` CMake\r\nadd_definitions(${CPPFLAG_CURL_STATICLIB})\r\n```\r\nmight have to be added to CMakeLists.txt. Will be happy to submit a pull request.
