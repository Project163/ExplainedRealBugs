Nixpkgs version\n\n- Unstable (25.05)\n- Stable (24.11)\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThis is another netrc parsing bug. curl 8.11.1 fails to parse password-only entries when they're followed by other entries. Unlike the previous netrc bugs in 8.11.x, there's no visible error to indicate that the entry was not correctly parsed.\n\nRelevant issue: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/15767\nFixed upstream on master (will not be released [until February 5th](https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/15977)): https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/9fce2c55d4b0273ac99b59bd8cb982a6d96b88cf\n\n#### Impact\n\nImpacts all packages built against curl 8.11.1, including Nix, since:\n  - nixos-unstable: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/364160\n  - nixos-24.11: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/364355\n\nImpacts users using multiple private caches, particularly if set up using the cachix CLI.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAdd a password-only entry to `.netrc`, followed by any other entry. The first entry will not be used by curl.\n\n```\nmachine <hostname> password <password>\nmachine <anotherhostname> password <password>\n```\n\nA more concrete repro against a live private cache:\n\nnetrc:\n```\nmachine nixpkgs-netrc-repro.cachix.org password eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJqdGkiOiI3M2FiMDE1Mi1mNGU0LTQ1MTAtYjM4NC02NGVmNjAyZmNlNWMiLCJzY29wZXMiOiJjYWNoZSJ9.GPuZHYqV5NmSJW24D2F8ZgLEWimONAoVtzi_Xn4CwMQ\nmachine anythingelse.example.org login hello password world\n```\n\n```console\ncurl -v https://nixpkgs-netrc-repro.cachix.org/nix-cache-info --netrc-file /path/to/netrc\n```\n\nOn 8.11.1, you'll get a 401 because the token is not used.\nOn 8.11.0, you'll get a 200.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nPassword-less netrc entries should be parsed. See repro.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```console\n\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### System metadata\n\nsystem: \"x86_64-linux\", multi-user?: no, version: nix-env (Nix) 2.24.11, nixpkgs: e24b4c09e963677b1beea49d411cd315a024ad3a\n\n### Notify maintainers\n\ncc @domenkozar \n---\n\n**Note for maintainers:** Please tag this issue in your pull request description.
