if(conn->bits.ftp_use_data_ssl &&\r\n+  if(conn->bits.ftp_use_data_ssl && data->set.ftp_use_port &&\r\n      !Curl_conn_is_ssl(conn, SECONDARYSOCKET)) {\r\n    result = Curl_ssl_cfilter_add(data, conn, SECONDARYSOCKET);\r\n    if(result)\r\n```\r\nIt works for me, but there might be better solutions since I'm not familiar with curl source code good enough.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1455691578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SandakovMM","id":4586815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODY4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4586815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM","html_url":"https://github.com/SandakovMM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandakovMM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8671304374,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c5f3_lgzwAAAAIE2Zq2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8671304374","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-06T08:23:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8671304385,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c5f3_lgzwAAAAIE2ZrB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8671304385","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-06T08:23:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1455956830","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/10666#issuecomment-1455956830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10666","id":1455956830,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5WyCNe","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-06T11:25:07Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T11:25:07Z","body":"@bagder:
