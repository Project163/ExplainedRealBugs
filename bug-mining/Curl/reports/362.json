This has always worked properly for git-cinnabar users... until macOS Sonoma, where [things broke](https://github.com/glandium/git-cinnabar/issues/319).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what older versions of macOS had, but it now uses curl 8.4.0 with libressl 3.3.6. It might have been using older versions of libressl before, or maybe openssl, I don't know. Anyways, what happens is that the call to `EVP_cleanup()` in `ossl_cleanup()` frees ciphers and digests lists, but the call to `OPENSSL_init_ssl` in `ossl_init` doesn't fill new cipher and digests lists, because they are statically initialized once, ever (their initialization uses pthread_once).\r\n\r\nThis causes SSL failures after calling curl_global_cleanup and curl_global_init.\r\n\r\nThis can be easily reproduced by taking `docs/examples/https.c` and apply this patch to it:\r\n```\r\n--- docs/examples/https.c\r\n+++ docs/examples/https.c\r\n@@ -34,6 +34,8 @@\r\n   CURLcode res;\r\n \r\n   curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);\r\n+  curl_global_cleanup();\r\n+  curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);\r\n \r\n   curl = curl_easy_init();\r\n   if(curl) {\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't require macOS Sonoma to reproduce: this breaks similarly when running on a Linux host with curl 8.5.0 built against a manually built libressl 3.8.2.\r\n\r\nThe curl_global_cleanup manual says \"You should call [curl_global_cleanup](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_global_cleanup.html) once for each call you make to [curl_global_init](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_global_init.html), after you are done using libcurl.\", which implies the testcase is not doing anything illegal.\n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\n8.4.0\n\n### operating system\n\nmacOS Sonoma 14.2","closed_by":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12525/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
