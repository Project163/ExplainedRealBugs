Please find attached a local traffic capture on the sample request described above: [a2.pcap.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19051805/a2.pcap.zip)\n(zipped because GitHub doesn't seem to accept `.pcap` files)\n\nFrom the traffic capture it may be observed that:\n1. The server does not include that `foo:` header within the HEADERS frame.\n2. Instead it sends CONTINUATION frames for that header.\n3. Both of which above are understandable due to the large size. (same behavior also for the other cases like 99 KB).\n4. The client then sends GOAWAY prior to the server's finishing the request (subsequent CONTINUATION frames for that header + DATA frame for the body). (**edit:** also it has got [the `COMPRESSION_ERROR` error code](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-7) included.)\n\nThus I would assume it's an issue related to nghttp2, which might come from either nghttp2 itself or curl's configuration of it.\n\nBesides, the sample server appears to work properly with other HTTP clients (e.g. Chromium[1]) with the 105 KB case.\n\n[1]: That won't work directly though due to the lack of h2c support. That however may be verified by introducing TLS+ALPN (e.g. to add a self-signed cert to the Nginx configuration or to put that service behind a TLS terminator) to suggest h2.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2693962880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"starrify","id":388828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/388828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify","html_url":"https://github.com/starrify","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16532285631,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c6sPDHlzwAAAAPZZqi_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/16532285631","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-03T10:46:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16532285654,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c6sPDHlzwAAAAPZZqjW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/16532285654","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-03T10:46:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2694031292","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16535#issuecomment-2694031292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16535","id":2694031292,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6gk6e8","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-03T11:13:50Z","updated_at":"2025-03-03T11:13:50Z","body":"@starrify

Sample output from tshark:\n\n```\n$ tshark -nr ff28c1e8e.pcap -Y 'tcp.dstport == 8080 && http2.type == 7'\n   16   0.014297    127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.1    HTTP2 83 0 [TCP ZeroWindow] , GOAWAY[0]\n```\n\nSample output from wireshark:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86192698-9f28-4739-8958-160ab110d308)\n\nJust in case I happened to have sent a wrong file, could you please also verify that the SHA256 checksum of `ff28c1e8e.pcap` is `a86e4eda51f370ae28756dd0aede02f7c6961d01c348412123a98f4c9eb4d557`?\n\n> Could you double check that the log is actually produced by a curl with https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/16544\n\nI went verifying my shell history and to the best of my knowledge it is indeed at that branch where I made a local build and recorded the `ff28c1e8e.{log,pcap}` files.\n\n> the https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ff28c1e8e077be4c9e44702414b0c2c1591339bd.log does not show any of the error message that your PR added for reporting failure.\n\nHmm.. I do _not_ expect it to. In the main text of this issue report I described two cases observed. [My other PR](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/16536) specifically targets case 1 (e.g. 101 KB payload) and here we've been talking about case 2 (e.g. 105 KB payload). I would assume that this is also the reason why #16544 doesn't fix it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2696880936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"starrify","id":388828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/388828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify","html_url":"https://github.com/starrify","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starrify/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16554027196,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c6sPDHlzwAAAAPasmi8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/16554027196","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-04T09:54:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16554027218,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c6sPDHlzwAAAAPasmjS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/16554027218","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-04T09:54:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2696966660","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16535#issuecomment-2696966660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16535","id":2696966660,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6gwHIE","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-04T10:22:10Z","updated_at":"2025-03-04T10:22:10Z","body":"Tried
