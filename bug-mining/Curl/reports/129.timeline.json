Hello, project curl!\r\n\r\nWhile building Zabbix with libcurl 7.87.0 and above, the build fails due to a syntax error caused by the expansion of the `curl_easy_setopt()` macro into the `__extension__` block.\r\n\r\nIn Zabbix, a common construct for setting handle options is used, when setting multiple options sequentially, to capture the last attempted option setting, to report it, in case of a failure. An example of this can be [seen here](https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix/blob/master/src/libs/zbxsysinfo/simple/simple.c#L191-L203).\r\n\r\nThis appears to be caused by [this change set](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/9667), which introduced deprecation notices to library users, yet inadvertently violated the users ability to rely on standard C semantics. This appears to be a _severe_ issue as a result.\r\n\r\nZabbix is tracking this issue as [ZBX-22142](https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-22142), which also contains a more detailed description of the cause. The Debian project have also filed this as a _serious_ [bug on their bug tracker](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1027118), and appear to intend to issue an FTBFS notice.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\nPretty much anywhere we've found 7.87.0 to be present.
