#19109\n\n## Problem\n\nGSSAPI authentication fails on macOS when curl is built with `--with-openssl` and `--with-gssapi`, producing the error:\n```\ngss_init_sec_context() failed: An unsupported mechanism was requested. unknown mech-code 0 for mech unknown.\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nCommit 0a5ea09a910e (PR #13098) introduced TLS channel binding for SPNEGO/GSSAPI authentication unconditionally. However, Apple's Heimdal GSSAPI implementation (used on macOS) does not support the `GSS_C_CHANNEL_BOUND_FLAG` required for channel binding, causing authentication to fail.\n\nThe PR notes stated \"This change require krb5 >= 1.19\", but macOS uses Apple's Heimdal fork which lacks this feature even in current versions.\n\n### Background on Apple's Heimdal Fork\n\nApple's implementation is a fork of Heimdal that has been deprecated since OS X Lion 10.7 (2011). The version distributed with macOS is based on Heimdal 1.7-prerelease from 2009 and lacks modern GSSAPI features including `GSS_C_CHANNEL_BOUND_FLAG`. While Apple deprecated this API over a decade ago in favor of their proprietary GSS framework, the standard GSSAPI headers remain available for compatibility, causing curl's build system to detect and use them.\n\nSimilarly, GNU GSS (an alternative GSSAPI implementation) also lacks `GSS_C_CHANNEL_BOUND_FLAG` support.\n\n## Solution\n\nMake GSSAPI channel binding conditional based on `GSS_C_CHANNEL_BOUND_FLAG` availability:\n\n1. Added `CURL_GSSAPI_HAS_CHANNEL_BINDING` detection macro in `curl_gssapi.h`\n2. Made `negotiatedata.channel_binding_data` field conditional in `vauth.h`\n3. Guarded channel binding collection/cleanup in `http_negotiate.c` (2 locations)\n4. Guarded channel binding usage in `spnego_gssapi.c`\n\nThis follows the same pattern as `GSS_C_DELEG_POLICY_FLAG` detection (see `lib/curl_gssapi.c`) and ensures graceful degradation when channel binding is unavailable while maintaining full support for implementations that have it.\n\n## Changes\n\n- `lib/curl_gssapi.h`: Add feature detection macro with inline comment (addressing review feedback from @vszakats)\n- `lib/vauth/vauth.h`: Make struct field conditional\n- `lib/http_negotiate.c`: Conditional init/cleanup\n- `lib/vauth/spnego_gssapi.c`: Conditional channel binding usage\n\n## Testing\n\n- Verified compilation on macOS with Apple Heimdal (no channel binding support)\n- Verified channel binding still works with MIT Kerberos >= 1.19\n- Authentication succeeds in both configurations without errors\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- No API changes\n- No breaking changes to existing functionality\n- Windows SSPI channel binding (`SECPKG_ATTR_ENDPOINT_BINDINGS`) unaffected\n- SOCKS5 and SASL GSSAPI authentication unaffected (don't use channel binding)\n- ABI changes are compile-time only (acceptable for curl)\n\n## Security\n\nChannel binding provides additional security by tying GSSAPI authentication to the specific TLS channel, mitigating relay attacks. This change:\n- Maintains channel binding support where available (MIT Kerberos >= 1.19)\n- Gracefully falls back to standard GSSAPI auth where unavailable (Apple Heimdal, GNU GSS)\n- Does not introduce new vulnerabilities (standard GSSAPI auth is still secure)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20386140049,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c7SQqUTzwAAAAS_G8-R","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20386140049","actor":{"login":"devdattatalele","id":50290838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjkwODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50290838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele","html_url":"https://github.com/devdattatalele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devdattatalele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"651bba96111f34396f1429e582010e41f3d32750","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/devdattatalele/curl/commits/651bba96111f34396f1429e582010e41f3d32750","created_at":"2025-10-20T18:14:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-20T18:16:05Z","updated_at":"2025-10-20T18:16:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19166","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19166/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19166/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19166/events","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/19166","id":3533415874,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAiu0c6urwk8","number":19166,"title":"GSS:

Just going to the apple-oss-distributions repository list will show all open source projects used since the beginning of Mac OS X. Instead, use the project list for a specific macOS version, e.g. [macos-156](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/distribution-macOS/tree/macos-156) (the most recent version published as of now), and KerberosLibraries is not included. Heimdal *is* included, as well as a project called [MITKerberosShim](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/MITKerberosShim/tree/123740bd0c25d4cdf79129415603511f657e2e39), which provides MIT Kerberos headers that reexport/link to symbols from Heimdal.\n\n> Is there an evidence for Heimdal I missed?\n\nI think so.

But Apple have layered several proprietary components for better integration with the OS. That’s why I would frame the Kerberos implementation on macOS as being based on, but now completely distinct from, the open source Heimdal project.\n\n> edit 2: that said, Apple deprecated its GSS support in 2011 (in OS X Lion), and it doesn't seem to be the most prudent thing to rely on the built-in support, instead of a fresh version of it.\n\nApple deprecated the GSS headers in `/usr/include`. The headers in `/System/Library/Frameworks/GSS.framework/Headers` are the non-deprecated versions.\n\nRegarding using MIT Kerberos directly on macOS: I don’t think it that is realistic for most IT departments. Our environment deploys Kerberos configuration and AD binding via an MDM. I imagine a lot of other environments do similarly, and MDMs don’t provide configuration for MIT Kerberos out-of-the-box. Apple also adds a bunch of proprietary components in their Kerberos implementation to integrate with the operating system; some of the features are [documented here](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/kerberos-sso-extension-depe6a1cda64/web). Switching to MIT Kerberos would be fairly toilsome and would make enterprise IT generally more difficult, in my opinion.\n\nI also didn’t realize when I wrote the report that [Secure Transport is on the way out](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/01/14/secure-transport-support-in-curl-is-on-its-way-out/), which seems perfectly reasonable given Apple’s deprecation choices. But that’s why I hope something can be done to support Kerberos on macOS with OpenSSL.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3423786834/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rsesek","id":57350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek","html_url":"https://github.com/rsesek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsesek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3424026287","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/19109#issuecomment-3424026287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19109","id":3424026287,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c7MFn6v","user":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-20T22:56:57Z","updated_at":"2025-10-20T23:05:19Z","body":"@rsesek Thanks for the details!\n\nOn a 15.6.1 (arm) machine, there is no `/System/Library/Frameworks/GSS.framework/Headers`. `/System/Library/Frameworks/GSS.framework` does exist, in it a broken symlink to `GSS`, and `Helpers`, `Resources`, `Versions` subdirs/symlinks, but no `Headers`.

Is it another Apple magic shortcut to find these headers at `GSS/gssapi.h`? Also if so, would the magic work with stock llvm/clang or gcc?\n\nThat is how headers are resolved for framework include dirs (e.g. [`<Security/Security.h>`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/38c19edd67e705066379530bdc28ea6c25aba8df/lib/vtls/apple.c#L50)). A framework include dir is specified with `clang -F` but `$isysroot/System/Library/Frameworks` is in the default search path.\n\n> Just detecting seems to be an oddball thing. To top it off, there is no version information to find. Not in headers, not in a `.pc` file because those are missing, along with the libs which are hidden inside the shared cache blob (but they also have no version info). `krb5-config` copies point to the fake MIT Kerberos thingy.\n\nYes, I could not find a reliable version constant in the headers. I think relying on detecting `Apple MITKerberosShim` via `krb5-config --vendor` is probably correct for native Kerberos on macOS.\n\n> Even if detected, it's Heimdal, and we dropped support. It should compile fine indeed, but it (the mainline one) kept leaking memory according to valgrind: [#19008](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/19008)\n> \n> Also: https://github.com/curl/curl/actions/runs/18515446182/job/52764754302 via [#19068](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/19068)\n\nThis is why I suggest treating Apple Kerberos differently from mainline Heimdal. If you consider Apple Kerberos to be the latter, that seems like it drops Kerberos support entirely on macOS for practical purposes.\n\nBut regarding the Heimdal leaks referenced from https://github.com/curl/curl/actions/runs/18515446182/job/52764754302 , all of these share the same common stack trace elements:\n\n```\n==13922==    by 0x4C36ED2: __pthread_once_slow (pthread_once.c:116)\n==13922==    by 0x5D1F57D: heim_base_once_f (in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libheimbase.so.1.0.0)\n==13922==    by 0x53A25B5: krb5_init_context (in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libkrb5.so.26.0.0)\n```\n\n[`pthread_once`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_once.3p.html) is used to lazily perform one-time initialization. In my experience, these shouldn’t be considered true leaks or bugs.
