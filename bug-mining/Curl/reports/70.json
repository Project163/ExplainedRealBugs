However, it appears that the previously set CURLOPT_UPLOAD overrides this behavior and causes an HTTP PUT to occur. I would expect CURLOPT_POST to unset HTTP PUT as well as HTTP GET and HTTP HEAD (much like setting CURLOPT_HTTPGET overrides previously set CURLOPT_NOBODY and CURLOPT_UPLOAD).\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\ncurl 7.85.0 (aarch64-apple-darwin21.6.0) libcurl/7.85.0 (SecureTransport) OpenSSL/1.1.1q zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.9 zstd/1.5.2 libidn2/2.3.3 libssh2/1.10.0 nghttp2/1.49.0 librtmp/2.3\r\nRelease-Date: 2022-08-31\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp \r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz MultiSSL NTLM NTLM_WB SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\r\n### operating system\r\nmacOS Monterey","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
