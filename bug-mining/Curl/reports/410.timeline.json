is the second part of reworking curl's \"send\" or \"upload\" handling. The changes will arrive in a series of PRs, based on top of each other, similar to the client writer ones. For part 0 see #12963, part 1 is #12964.\r\n\r\n### Client Reader\r\n\r\nAdded as documented [in CLIENT-READER.md](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/5b1f31dfbab8aef467c419c68aa06dc738cb75d4/docs/CLIENT-READERS.md).\r\n\r\n- old `Curl_buffer_send()` completely replaced by new `Curl_req_send()`\r\n- old `Curl_fillreadbuffer()` replaced with `Curl_client_read()`\r\n- HTTP chunked uploads are now formatted in a client reader added when needed.\r\n- FTP line-end conversions are done in a client reader added when needed.\r\n- when sending requests headers, remaining buffer space is filled with body data for sending in \"one go\". This is independent of the request body size. Resolves  #12938 as now small and large requests have the same code path.\r\n\r\nChanges done to test cases:\r\n- test513: now fails before sending request headers as this initial \"client read\" triggers the setup fault. Behaves now the same as in hyper build\r\n- test547, test555, test1620: fix the length check in the lib code to only fail for reads *smaller* than expected. This was a bug in the test code that never triggered in the old implementation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11950671658,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAiu0c5_O0XrzwAAAALIUMcq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/11950671658","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"9369c30cd87c041cf983bcdfabd1570980abbaf6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/9369c30cd87c041cf983bcdfabd1570980abbaf6","created_at":"2024-02-28T11:59:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1968890142","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12938#issuecomment-1968890142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12938","id":1968890142,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c51WuEe","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-28T12:34:13Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T12:34:13Z","body":"Not quite there yet.
