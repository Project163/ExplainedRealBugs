it be useful to make a few tests, which try to connect to a few smtp servers in different combinations and try to see if we come to the authentication part?\nIf no internet is available, the test should not return an error.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2647622002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MonkeybreadSoftware","id":1464807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjQ4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1464807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware","html_url":"https://github.com/MonkeybreadSoftware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeybreadSoftware/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2647631648","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16189#issuecomment-2647631648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16189","id":2647631648,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6dz6cg","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-10T10:55:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-10T10:55:22Z","body":"Adding tests for this would be awesome of course. However, I don't think our test suite should use any remotely accessed servers, only things we run locally. Because that's how our test suite runs (and a enough number of users run the test suite without access to the internet), because we don't run those other servers and don't want our test suite to become a DDOS attack on them and because using \"random\" remote servers tend to be fragile and flaky.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2647631648/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17419012359,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c6o4zR6zwAAAAQOQQkH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/17419012359","actor":{"login":"pps83","id":1614246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1614246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83","html_url":"https://github.com/pps83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eebb12c604fc3204bf198e78e7c89f049735b8a8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pps83/curl/commits/eebb12c604fc3204bf198e78e7c89f049735b8a8","created_at":"2025-04-26T22:34:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
