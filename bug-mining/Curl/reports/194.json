libcurl 7.88.0/7.88.1, we sometimes encountered this issue, that the sending request was 'Expire cleared', it tried to reuse connections but ' Connection died, tried 5 times before giving up'.\r\n\r\nRefer to the attached logs:\r\n[logs_libcurl_7_87_0.txt](https://github.com/curl/curl/files/10858698/logs_libcurl_7_87_0.txt)\r\n[logs_libcurl_7_88_0.txt](https://github.com/curl/curl/files/10858699/logs_libcurl_7_88_0.txt)\r\n\r\nThere're 6 connections in the cache but they are all dead.\r\nWith 7.87.0, when handling a new request, it fount that the connection is already dead before sending data (_Connection 2 seems to be dead_), then it remove all dead connections.\r\nWith 7.88.0, when handling a new request, it did not remove any dead connection before sending data, but failed to send data (_we are done reading and this is set to close, stop send_), then it retry the next died connection (_Connection died, retrying a fresh connect (retry count: 1)_, finally it failed after retried with 5 times.\r\n\r\nWe checked the history and found that, before `create_conn` it will `prune_dead_connections`, the detecting method was changed at here:\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/71b7e0161032927cdfb4e75ea40f65b8898b3956#diff-a8a54563608f8155973318f4ddb61d7328dab512b8ff2b5cc48cc76979d4204c\r\n```\r\n-      dead = SocketIsDead(conn->sock[FIRSTSOCKET]);\r\n+      dead = !Curl_conn_is_alive(data, conn);\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like it cannot find the connection that is already dead before sending data.","closed_by":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10646/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
