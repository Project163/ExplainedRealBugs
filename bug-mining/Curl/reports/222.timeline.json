I did this\n\nIn 4e2b52b5f7a, sftp handling of `~` was restricted to `sftp://url/~/` to fix CVE-2023-27534.\n\nA bit later, #11001 was opened to report a regression because previously `sftp://url/~` listed the home dir but now it wasn't working.\n\nThen 91b53efa4b6 fixed it by resolving `/~` to `/home/<user>`, but as far as I could test (bookworm's, trixie's and sid's versions), it actually doesn't work at all and we get a:\n\n```bash\ncharles@enjoyed-hen:~/git/curl$ curl -k sftp://10.25.175.17/~ -u dan:danpwd\ncurl: (79) Error in the SSH layer\n```\n\nAt the same time, `/~/` gives:\n\n```bash\ncharles@enjoyed-hen:~/git/curl$ curl -k sftp://10.25.175.17/~/ -u dan:danpwd\n-rw-r--r--    1 dan      dan          3526 May 31 14:20 .bashrc\n-rw-r--r--    1 dan      dan

4096 May 31 14:37 .\n```\n\nAfter debugging things with gdb, the problem is `Curl_getworkingpath` returning `/home/<user>` for the first case and `/home/<user>/` for the second. Later in the code (in `ssh_statemachine`), it inspects the last char of `sshp->path` to decide if it's going to `SSH_SFTP_READDIR_INIT` or `SSH_SFTP_DOWNLOAD_INIT`. As you might have guessed by now, for the `/~` case, it tries to download `/home/<user>` and things fail.\n\nHere is a proposed patch to fix the issue:\n\n```diff\nFrom e8e59da93bdc76b9776c49ed7c1bfc7659504ebc Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001\nFrom: Carlos Henrique Lima Melara <charlesmelara@riseup.net>\nDate: Thu, 5 Jun 2025 02:32:50 +0000\nSubject: [PATCH] curl_path: make SFTP path /~ returns /home/<user>/\n\n---\n lib/vssh/curl_path.c | 5 +++++\n 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)\n\ndiff --git a/lib/vssh/curl_path.c b/lib/vssh/curl_path.c\nindex 117d2e600..be150f454 100644\n--- a/lib/vssh/curl_path.c\n+++ b/lib/vssh/curl_path.c\n@@ -83,6 +83,11 @@ CURLcode Curl_getworkingpath(struct Curl_easy *data,\n         free(working_path);\n         return CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY;\n       }\n+    } else {\n+      if(curlx_dyn_add(&npath, \"/\")) {\n+        free(working_path);\n+        return CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY;\n+      }\n     }\n   }\n\n--\n2.47.2\n\n```\n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.14.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.14.1 OpenSSL/3.5.0 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.7 libidn2/2.3.8 libpsl/0.21.2 libssh2/1.11.1 nghttp2/1.64.0 nghttp3/1.8.0 librtmp/2.3 OpenLDAP/2.6.9\nRelease-Date: 2025-06-04, security patched: 8.14.1-2\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n\n\n### operating system\n\nDebian testing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
