Ask questions on the mailing lists https://curl.se/mail/\r\n\r\n     SECURITY RELATED? Post it here: https://hackerone.com/curl\r\n\r\n     There are collections of known issues to be aware of:\r\n     https://curl.se/docs/knownbugs.html\r\n     https://curl.se/docs/todo.html       -->\r\n\r\n### I did this\r\n\r\nVisited [a web site](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news) in [NetSurf](https://www.netsurf-browser.org/), which [uses libcurl](http://git.netsurf-browser.org/netsurf.git/tree/content/fetchers/curl.c) and openssl.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./nsfb -f sdl https://www.bbc.co.uk/news\r\n```\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\nDid not expect the X509 certificate parsing to dominate the time spent loading the page.\r\n\r\nSee the following profile:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-28 12-27-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8228915/187071797-d709ffe5-da01-4426-8d6a-aea429f77ee2.png)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nvalgrind --tool=callgrind ./nsfb -f sdl https://www.bbc.co.uk/news\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows that the `X509_LOOKUP_ctrl_ex` function takes 87% of the total time spent processing the page. That calls through to `X509_load_cert_crl_file_ex`, etc.\r\n\r\nRunning it again under strace:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nstrace -o log -eopenat  ./nsfb -f sdl https://www.bbc.co.uk/news\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see that the certificates file is opened 15 times:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngrep -c \"ca-certificates\" log\r\n15\r\ngrep \"ca-certificates\" log\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 8\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 11\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 11\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 11\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 12\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 13\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 14\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 12\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 17\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 17\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 17\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 18\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 20\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 20\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\", O_RDONLY) = 20\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it looks like `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` is opened and parsed over and over again. Can anything be done to change to parsing it once and keeping it cached?\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\ncurl 7.81.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.81.0 OpenSSL/3.0.2 zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.9 zstd/1.4.8 libidn2/2.3.2 libpsl/0.21.0 (+libidn2/2.3.2) libssh/0.9.6/openssl/zlib nghttp2/1.43.0 librtmp/2.3 OpenLDAP/2.5.12\r\nRelease-Date: 2022-01-05\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp \r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM NTLM_WB PSL SPNEGO SSL TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nLinux happy 5.15.0-41-generic #44-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 22 14:20:53 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9379/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
