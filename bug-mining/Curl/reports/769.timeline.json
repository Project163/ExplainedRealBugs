thanks for the report. I added tests for super-sized URLs in #18129:\n\nWith url lenghts less than 64KB, all protocols work and behave the same. When crossing 64KB, things start to differ:\n\n* http/1.1: works the same, Apache httpd gives HTTP response 414\n* h2: fails sending the request due to protocol limitations that cannot send headers that do not fit in a frame\n* h3: gives HTTP response 431 from nghttpx (this might vary with other servers)\n\nSo, in these tests, curl works just as intended.
