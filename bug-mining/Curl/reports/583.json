Specify which documentation you found a problem with\n\nGenerated manpage curl.1\n\n### The problem\n\nDebian's lintian flagged the following issue when I packaged the latest version:\r\n`W: curl: groff-message troff:<standard input>:1315: warning: expected numeric expression, got 'f' [usr/share/man/man1/curl.1.gz:1]`\r\n\r\nThis is regarding the line `\".IP \"false\" (default)\"` which is under the section for `--ech <config>`.\r\n\r\nThe generated website looks correct at https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html:\r\n> The values allowed for <config> can be:\r\n> \r\n> false (default)\r\n> \r\n>     Do not attempt ECH \r\n\r\nBut the manpage is missing that line, I can see it in the manpage source, it just doesn't get rendered, the result is:\r\n> The values allowed for <config> can be:\r\n> \r\n>     Do not attempt ECH \r\n\r\nI believe something is breaking on `scripts/managen` due to the https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/cmdline-opts/ech.md?plain=1#L23\r\n\r\nMy wild guess is that the presence of `(default)` is throwing off some managen logic to translate the double quotes. Grepping through the source code, this is the first case where the docs have a pattern of `## \"something\" (default)`.\r\n\r\nI would assume it's something simple to fix, but I'm still dealing with a packaging issue regarding multi-arch on the Debian side that I need to fix first (to get the package uploaded).","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15506/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
