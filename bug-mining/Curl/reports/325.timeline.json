This matches the logs nicely, although I can't match up the timing because hi-res timing isn't available in the Windows sockfilt.\r\n1. client1 connects, sockfilt sends CNCT to server\r\n2. client1 disconnects, sockfilt sends DISC to server †\r\n3. new client2 connects, sockfilt sends CNCT to server\r\n4. server wakes up, sees the first CNCT, sends 220 response *to the wrong client2*\r\n5. sockfilt passes on 220 to client2\r\n6. client2 sees 220, then responds with its next command, EHLO\r\n7. server then gets the DISC, resets itself\r\n8. server then sees the second CNCT, sends 220 response to the right client2 this time *but they're now out of sync*\r\n9. client sees the 220 response, thinks that's for its EHLO command. *Client is out of sync with the server*. Client responds based on its 220 instead of the 250 it should have received and the test protocol section is broken.\r\n\r\n† The only open question is why in step 2 the client disconnects. Could it be this same race condition with the test server's verifyftp() call? In any case, it doesn't really matter because an unexpected disconnect could happen for any reason and the sockfilt+server would get out of sync and potentially stay out of sync.\r\n\r\nI can think of two easy(ish) ways to fix this:\r\n1. Require an acknowledgement step after one side sends a DISC. Have both sides throw everything away until an ACKD is received.\r\n2. Send a connection number along with every command, e.g. `DISC 123` or `DATA 123\\nfe84\\n` to tie the command to a particular socket. The number would be monotonically increasing to avoid duplicates. If one side receives a command for a closed socket, it's thrown out.\r\n\r\nThe first one is probably the

I did this\n\nWe install the test suite so that we can run it on target as part of integration testing.  Occasionally, one of the tests will timeout.  For an example of this, see https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/20240409-14/testresults/qemux86-64-ptest/curl.log.\r\n\r\nThis shows test 340 fails after waiting two minutes for a response from the server. I initially blamed a heavily loaded host machine (as the tests are running inside a qemu-system) but the test execution started at 12:51, test 340 started at 12:52, and times out two minutes later at 12:54.  This suggests that the other tests are all running quickly and the problem is not system load.\r\n\r\nhttps://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15268 is our tracker bug for this issue, it can be seen that there's no hugely obvious pattern (to me, at least) to what tests fail.  We also pass `!flaky !timing-dependent` to `runtests.pl` to filter out tests marked as such.\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that there's a subtle race in the test harness, which is only visible when running the tests frequently.\n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.7.1\n\n### operating system\n\nOpenEmbedded","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13350/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
