API documentation for curl_url_get() mentions normalizing when extracting a URL (only), so this code does not affect retrieving the individual components.\r\n\r\n## normalizing\r\n\r\nIt implies URL decoding + URL encoding every URL part, independently and then put the cleansed versions together into a full URL. This process can however not be an *unconditional*  decode + encode for each part since generally URL encoding would encode characters that users might actually prefer even need to have as-is in the URL. An example being `=` in the query part, that is typically treated differently than `%3D`. This makes *normalizing* opinionated and not strictly a spec thing.\r\n\r\n## todo:\r\n\r\n- [X] normalize (lowercase) hostnames\r\n- [X] normalize path\r\n- [X] normalize query\r\n- [X] normalize fragment\r\n- [X] normalize user\r\n- [X] normalize password\r\n- [X] normalize option\r\n- [X] add option to select normalizing: `CURLU_NORMALIZE`\r\n- [X] document new option\r\n- [X] document exactly how the normalization is done and works\r\n\r\nExtend test 1560 to verify\r\n\r\nFixes #16829\r\nReported-by: Alberto Leiva
