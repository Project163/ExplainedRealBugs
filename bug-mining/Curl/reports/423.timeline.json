#, if available:*\r\n* N/A\r\n\r\n*What was changed?*\r\n* Added dual-stack endpoint support (endpoint URL construction)\r\n* Added IP version filter\r\n* Speed up the ControlPlaneUrl test\r\n* Add new CMake flag combinations test\r\n\r\n*Why was it changed?*\r\n* SDK support for [dual-stack endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#dual-stack-endpoints)\r\n\r\n*How was it changed?*\r\n- To construct the correct URL, the SDK needs to know two things:\r\n  1. Region (currently a parameter exists)\r\n  2. Dual-stack or the legacy one (no parameter previously existed)\r\n- Therefore, the `useLegacyEndpoint` parameter was added.\r\n- Since these changes double the number of endpoint combinations, I refactored `constructControlPlaneUrl` to add more clarity on the different URL components and use a single string template instead of one string template for each branch.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> For backwards compatibility, the legacy endpoint (IPV4 only) will still be the default.\r\n\r\n- For the IP filters, the SDK will pass the selected setting to curl.\r\n- Documented the Endpoint provider and IP version provider chain in the Readme.\r\n  - The chain was designed to allow builders maximum flexibility to enable and disable environment variable control (without needing to fork or patch the SDK).\r\n\r\n*What testing was done for the changes?*\r\n- Added CMake combination tests to verify that the CMake fails if multiple of the mutually-exclusive flags were specified.\r\n  - This test has been added to the CI and outputs a markdown summary\r\n- Manually verified the `#error` directives by commenting out the CMake checks.\r\n- Rewrote existing unit test to verify the URL construction.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This specific original test took about 10s to run on my setup. This pull request speeds up that test to run in under 1ms on my setup, in addition to doubling the number of combinations checked.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-c/issues/476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-c/issues/476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
