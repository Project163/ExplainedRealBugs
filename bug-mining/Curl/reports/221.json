I believe I introduced this defect in my prior suggestion.  When ws_decode returns EAGAIN (https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/ws.c#L451), the next read happens at the beginning of buffer, even if the previous fragment is not located there.  I suggest updating these lines to:\r\n\r\n>  if(result == CURLE_AGAIN) {\r\n>    /* a packet fragment only, loop and try reading more */\r\n>    memmove(data->state.buffer, wsp->stillb, wsp->stillblen);\r\n>    continue;\r\n>  }\r\n\r\ncurl/libcurl version\r\ncurl 7.88.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.88.1 OpenSSL/3.0.2 zlib/1.2.11\r\nRelease-Date: 2023-02-20\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS HSTS HTTPS-proxy IPv6 Largefile libz NTLM NTLM_WB SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets\r\n\r\noperating system\r\nLinux virt-linux 5.19.0-35-generic https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/36~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Feb 17 15:17:25 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10962/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
