Re-enable `HAVE_GETADDRINFO` detection on Windows\r\n\r\n   Commit d08ee3c83d6bd416aef62ff844c98e47c4682429 (in 2013) added logic\r\n   that automatically assumed `getaddrinfo()` to be present for builds with\r\n   IPv6 enabled. As it turns out, certain toolchains (e.g. original MinGW)\r\n   by default target older Windows versions, and thus do not support\r\n   `getaddrinfo()` out of the box. The issue was masked for a while by CMake\r\n   builds forcing a newer Windows version, but that logic got deleted in\r\n   commit 8ba22ffb2030ed91312fc8634e29516cdf0a9761. Since then, some CI\r\n   builds started failing due to IPv6 enabled, `HAVE_GETADDRINFO` set, but\r\n   `getaddrinfo()` in fact missing.\r\n\r\n   It also turns out that IPv6 works without `getaddrinfo()` since commit\r\n   67a08dca27a6a07b36c7f97252e284ca957ff1a5 (from 2019, via #4662). So, to\r\n   resolve all this, we can now revert the initial commit, thus restoring\r\n   `getaddrinfo()` detection and support IPv6 regardless of its outcome.\r\n\r\n   Reported-by: Daniel Stenberg\r\n\r\n2. Omit `bcrypt` with original MinGW\r\n\r\n   Original (aka legacy/old) MinGW versions do not support `bcrypt`\r\n   (introduced with Vista). We already have logic to handle that in\r\n   `lib/rand.c` and autotools builds, where we do not call the unsupported\r\n   API and do not link `bcrypt`, respectively, when using original MinGW.\r\n\r\n   This patch ports that logic to CMake, fixing the link error:\r\n   `c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/9.2.0/../../../../mingw32/bin/ld.exe: cannot find -lbcrypt`\r\n\r\n   Ref: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl/builds/44624888/job/40vle84cn4vle7s0#L508\r\n   Regression since 76172511e7adcf720f4c77bd91f49278300ec97e\r\n\r\nFixes #9214\r\nFixes #9393\r\nFixes
