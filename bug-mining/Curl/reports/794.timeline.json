But here it is:\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3bb5e58c105d7be450b667858d1b8e7ae3ded555#diff-b682bf52b3bec04d8a4e398c3b5c41b3a4cdac40790ca7ab21a61423294a8dce\n\nSo before in `curl_memory.h` we had something like this:\n```\n#ifdef CURLDEBUG\n\n#undef strdup\n#undef malloc\n....\n#endif /* CURLDEBUG */\n```\n\nNow it is all moved into a new file `curl_mem_undef.h`, where all those thing are similarly undefined. But now unconditionally, without `#ifdef CURLDEBUG`.\n\nAnd this new file is included at the end of `curl_setup.h` now.\n\nThe problem is that in AIX header `/usr/include/sys/socket.h` `accept` is defined like this:\n```\n#define accept          naccept\n```\n\nAnd what we have now is that at the end of `curl_setup.h` we unconditionally undefine `accept`, which does upset the compiler.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3269300651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andrewkirillov-ibm","id":152863221,"node_id":"U_kgDOCRyB9Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/152863221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewkirillov-ibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"andrewkirillov-ibm","id":152863221,"node_id":"U_kgDOCRyB9Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/152863221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewkirillov-ibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewkirillov-ibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-09T07:29:41Z","updated_at":"2025-09-09T07:29:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18501","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18501/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18501/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18501/events","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/18501","id":3397046475,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAiu0c6niQby","number":18501,"title":"Added

I did this\n\nI was building 8.16.0 release on AIX in 32 bit mode and the build failed (64 bit build is good):\n```\n  CC       libcurl_la-altsvc.lo\naltsvc.c:230:8: error: call to undeclared library function 'fopen' with type 'FILE *(const char *, const char *)'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]\n  fp = fopen(file, FOPEN_READTEXT);\n       ^\naltsvc.c:230:8: note: include the header <stdio.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for 'fopen'\n```\n\nThe problem is very similar to the issue raised yesterday: #18500 \n\nSo it looks like for 32 bit builds, the `_LARGE_FILES` is defined in system headers. And then checking `/usr/include/stdio.h` we find this:\n```\n#ifdef _LARGE_FILES\n#define fseeko fseeko64\n#define ftello ftello64\n#define fgetpos fgetpos64\n#define fsetpos fsetpos64\n#define fopen fopen64\n#define freopen freopen64\n#endif /* _LARGE_FILES */\n```\n\nSo when doing 32 bit build, `fopen` becomes a `#define`.\n\nAnd now we get back to same problem as yesterday. `stdio.h` is included from `curl_setup.h`. At the end of `curl_setup.h` we include `curl_mem_undef.h`. And here we do `#undef fopen`.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI expect a clean build.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.16.0 tag\n\n### operating system\n\nAIX 7.2.5\nOnly when building in 32 bit mode","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18510/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
