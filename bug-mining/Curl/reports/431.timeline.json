Sorry, I meant locale. Why does it need to build the same output when you change locale?\r\n\r\nI think it's a goal set by the [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) efforts. By their description:\r\n\r\n> First, the build system needs to be made entirely deterministic: transforming a given source must always create the same result. For example, the current date and time must not be recorded and output always has to be written in the same order.\r\n> \r\n> Second, the set of tools used to perform the build and more generally the build environment should either be recorded or pre-defined.\r\n> \r\n> Third, users should be given a way to recreate a close enough build environment, perform the build process, and validate that the output matches the original build.\r\n\r\nThe rationale would be to allow anyone to check if the provided binary matches a \"build from my machine\".","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2028516459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"charles2910","id":34252251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjUyMjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34252251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910","html_url":"https://github.com/charles2910","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2028522600","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/13242#issuecomment-2028522600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13242","id":2028522600,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c546Mxo","user":{"login":"charles2910","id":34252251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjUyMjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34252251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910","html_url":"https://github.com/charles2910","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charles2910/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-31T01:42:46Z","updated_at":"2024-03-31T01:42:46Z","body":"I
