You want curl to behave as if it's receiving a HEAD response and close? What do you mean it causes an unwanted download? For example this download of 200MB should terminate immediately (after receiving the headers) if you tell curl it's a HEAD request but then change it custom to GET:\r\n~~~\r\ncurld -v -I -X GET http://cachefly.cachefly.net/200mb.test -o NUL\r\n~~~\r\nThe server sees GET and replies with the content but curl will terminate the connection after the headers.\r\n\r\nIt sounds to me like you want to simulate a HEAD reply for a server that does not support those requests but if you send a GET request to the server then it may send data before curl can close the connection. That's what you are asking the server to do with GET you want to get the resource.

I took a look at your latter example in Wireshark and google takes approximately 3 seconds to reply with HTTP/2 HEADERS, I don't know why so long but it has nothing to do with curl. Then the server follows with DATA frames and during that entire time which is less than 1 second like 100 200 ms curl replies with RST_STREAM on the stream and then GOAWAY on the connection. You cannot expect no data will be sent because you are requesting the data is sent and curl needs to hang up after receiving the headers.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2344301651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2346007192","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/14440#issuecomment-2346007192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14440","id":2346007192,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6L1TqY","user":{"login":"MasterInQuestion","id":81106051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTA2MDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81106051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterInQuestion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterInQuestion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-12T11:13:53Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T22:03:59Z","body":"[[\r\n    As I have explained, the server may send data before &#x60;curl&#x60; can close the connection.\r\n    I took a look at your latter example in Wireshark: and Google takes approximately 3 seconds to reply with HTTP/2 HEADERS.\r\n    I don't know why so long but it has nothing to do with &#x60;curl&#x60;.\r\n\r\n    Then the server follows with DATA frames, and during that entire time which is less than 1 second like 100, 200 ms:\r\n    &#x60;curl&#x60; replies with RST_STREAM on the stream and then GOAWAY on the connection.\r\n\r\n    You cannot expect no data will be sent: because you are requesting the data be sent.\r\n    And &#x60;curl&#x60; needs to hang up after receiving the headers.\r\n]]\r\n    So for this case, the validity of [\"--max-filesize 0\"](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/14440#issue-2453542464) seems to hold.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile I noted using \"--max-filesize 1\" with [\"-L\"](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-L), had caused those carp a redirection message of length:\r\n    To croak amid the redirection for \"(63) Maximum file size exceeded\".\r\n\r\n    Workaround would be rising the limit to somewhat higher more tolerable value, e.g. \"2K\" (2,048 B).\r\n    [ I find \"1500\" works more pleasantly.

https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/14440#issuecomment-2346734573 user @MasterInQuestion reports that --max-filesize is applied to the ignored content of a redirect response. For example `curl -v -L --max-filesize 1 http://localhost:8080` and the server's redirect reply has 5 content bytes:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nwhile true; \\\r\ndo perl -e 'print (\"HTTP/1.1 301\\r\\nContent-Length: 5\\r\\nLocation: http://localhost:8080/abc\\r\\n\\r\\napple\")' | nc -4l localhost 8080; \\\r\ndone\r\n~~~\r\n\r\ncurl will fail because 5 bytes of content (even though it's ignored) is more than 1:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n* STATE: DO => DID handle 0x76bd88; line 2164\r\n* STATE: DID => PERFORMING handle 0x76bd88; line 2282\r\n< HTTP/1.1 301\r\n< Content-Length: 5\r\n< Location: http://localhost:8080/abc\r\n* Maximum file size exceeded\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe failure is caused by a check in `Curl_http_size` which AFAICT compares even for body bytes that are not \"real\" so to speak:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/a3bd1dda12ec79cd63e0d81df4ec4b1fbbbcfa1b/lib/http.c#L3273-L3294\r\n\r\nThere is a separate check that is done in `cw_download_write` which deals with real body bytes, however by that point the download is already taking place.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/a3bd1dda12ec79cd63e0d81df4ec4b1fbbbcfa1b/lib/sendf.c#L326-L344\r\n\r\nIn other words, the former check causes curl to error immediately after the headers are received and the content length is known. The user may want this behavior because if they, say, limit to 1MB then maybe they don't want to download the first 1MB of a 100MB file. OTOH it seems that cw_download_write works in exactly that way, it will allow downloading to the maximum file size.\r\n\r\nSo if the former check is removed, which is my initial inclination, there will be a change in behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14899/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
