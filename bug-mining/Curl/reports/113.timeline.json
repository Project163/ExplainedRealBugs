I won't name names, but someone said that `data` always has a `conn` and we should remove that extra parameter. I am about to submit a PR that re-instates that.\r\n\r\nThe problem with `quic_set_client_cert` is that the method for handing out the effective ssl config is returning `NULL` if no SSL filter is detected. I'll change that in the PR as well. In the future, the QUIC connect filter should be of type `IP_CONNECT | SSL` to reflect what it does.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I will also  change is that, reflecting on the fact that during the \"setup\" calls things are not really fully initialized, filters should really do no action *other* than setting things up. Actions against the network should only start at the first \"connect\" call. I'll change that in the socket filter.\r\n\r\nI think this gives us a cleaner init phase and a better idea what happens
