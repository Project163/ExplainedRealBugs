Since we have all the data, we can determine the\n       effective length by skipping element until an end element is found. */\n    if(!elem->constructed)\n      return NULL;\n    elem->beg = beg;\n    while(beg < end && *beg) {\n      beg = getASN1Element(&lelem, beg, end);\n      if(!beg)\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n    // --- snip ---\n}\n```\n\nA specifically crafted x509 certificate can cause a lot of recursions by repeatedly triggering `beg = getASN1Element(&lelem, beg, end);` that eventually overflow the stack area and cause an abnormal crash of curl or a client using libcurl. This works because `getASN1Element()` calls itself again in line 219 after consuming two specific bytes from the certificate. Since only two bytes of ASN1 data are needed for a new invocation of `getASN1Element()`, a relatively small, malicious certificate can already cause a DOS.\n\nAccording to your vuln-disclosure-policy you don't consider this to be a security vulnerability, so I report it here as an issue. I did not make a PR because I am unsure how to best fix this.\n\nHere you can find a concrete certificate that triggers the stack-overflow when directly fed into `Curl_parseX509()`:\n[crash-3571ec1518df2d194685a4345a601d10d86c2ed0.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18608814/crash-3571ec1518df2d194685a4345a601d10d86c2ed0.txt)\n\n### I expected the following\n\nGraceful handling of the invalid certificate without crashing.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncommit 4f95f327093bef29a4f8fe188edc6c95f49980a5\n\n### operating system\n\nLinux \\<redacted\\> 6.12.6-arch1-1 \\#1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu, 19 Dec 2024 21:29:01 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linu","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16135/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
