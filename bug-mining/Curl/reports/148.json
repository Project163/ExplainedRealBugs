The 1st one is a POST request with no content (Content-Length: 0).\r\n2. The 2nd is a \"chunked\" Transfer-Encoding POST request, which supplies the content with the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback.\r\n\r\nThe 1st request goes through and receives a response, as expected.\r\nFor some reason, the 2nd request only sends out the header. It seems libcurl **never calls the callback function** to consume the content.\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\nThe problem can be reproduced like this:\r\n```\r\n#include <curl/curl.h>\r\n#include <assert.h>\r\n\r\nstatic size_t read_callback(char* buffer, size_t size, size_t nitems, void* userdata);\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\r\n{\r\n  CURL* curl = curl_easy_init();\r\n  assert(curl != NULL);\r\n  const char* url = argc > 1 ? argv[1] : \"http://localhost:8080/\";\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url);\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1L);\r\n\r\n  /* 1st request is a POST with no content */\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POST, 1L);\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, 0L);\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, \"\");\r\n  CURLcode result = curl_easy_perform(curl);\r\n  assert(result == CURLE_OK);\r\n\r\n  /* 2nd request is a POST with \"chunked\" transfer encoding */\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_READFUNCTION, read_callback);\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, NULL);\r\n  struct curl_slist* slist = curl_slist_append(NULL, \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\");\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, slist);\r\n  result = curl_easy_perform(curl);\r\n  assert(result == CURLE_OK);\r\n\r\n  curl_slist_free_all(slist);\r\n  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);\r\n\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic size_t read_callback(char* buffer, size_t size, size_t nitems, void* userdata)\r\n{\r\n  static int done = 0;\r\n  if (done) {\r\n    return 0;\r\n  }\r\n  done = 1;\r\n  assert(size * nitems >= 2);\r\n  buffer[0] = 'H';\r\n  buffer[1] = 'i';\r\n  return 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n./curltest http://httpbin.org/post\r\n* About to connect() to httpbin.org port 80 (#0)\r\n*   Trying 34.205.150.168...\r\n* Connected to httpbin.org (34.205.150.168) port 80 (#0)\r\n> POST /post HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: httpbin.org\r\nAccept: */*\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< (...response truncated for conciseness...)\r\n* Connection #0 to host httpbin.org left intact\r\n* Found bundle for host httpbin.org: 0x1e56ab0\r\n* Re-using existing connection!

Even 1 byte does the trick, like this for example:\r\n```\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, 1L);\r\n  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, \"X\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fact that the problem (in the 2nd request) is fixed just by setting some content in the body of the 1st request makes this look like a bug.\r\n\r\nThis is the output with the workaround in place:\r\n[workaround.txt](https://github.com/curl/curl/files/10437496/workaround.txt)\r\n\r\n### Version\r\nlibcurl version: 7.87.0\r\n\r\n[curl -V output]\r\n```\r\n# curl -V\r\ncurl 7.29.0 (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.87.0 OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips zlib/1.2.7 nghttp2/1.31.1\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\r\nFeatures: AsynchDNS Debug TrackMemory IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz unix-sockets\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n```\r\n# uname -a\r\nLinux blade-162-115 3.10.0-1160.15.2.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Feb 3 15:06:38 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny insight will be appreciated. I will be happy to provide more information as needed.\r\nThank you!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"RanBarLavie","id":109575426,"node_id":"U_kgDOBof9Ag","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109575426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie","html_url":"https://github.com/RanBarLavie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanBarLavie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10313/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
