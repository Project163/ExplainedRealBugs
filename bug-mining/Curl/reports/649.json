I did this\n\nWith the deprecation of winbuild I'm trying to build on Windows using cmake. \nI'm using a back level VS 2017 :\n \n```\n** Visual Studio 2017 Developer Command Prompt v15.6.4\n** Copyright (c) 2017 Microsoft Corporation\n```\n\nwhich includes cmake 3.10, and I'm hitting an error : \n```\nCMake Error at lib/CMakeLists.txt:110 (target_link_libraries):\n  Object library target
