I did this\n\nWhen connecting to a raw TCP using `curl` via `telnet` protocol, `8.15.0` errors with a `SIGSEGV` on amd64 GNU/Linux. \n\n```\n❯ curl --verbose telnet://localhost:7900\n* Host

Then I tried MPD (Music Player Daemon)'s raw TCP and same result occurred.\nThen tried `curl 8.14.1` and the issue doesn't exist.\n\nThen, as `localhost` was resolved to be the IPv6 local IP, I thought that this maybe related to that.
