Till this happens, the workaround is to force building against an older SDK that is compatible with gcc, e.g. SDK 12.

PR began as an attempt to drop GCC support, after repeated reports\r\non fallouts when trying to use it on macOS.\r\n\r\nThen it transformed into a 3-week project turning up the issues causing\r\nthe fallouts, ending up including llvm and all available Xcode / macOS\r\nSDK, macOS runner image, build tools and compiler vendors and versions.\r\nAccumulating 400 sub-commits.\r\n\r\nI developed and tested all fixes under this PR, then merged them as\r\nseparate patches.\r\n\r\nThis PR retained CI jobs updates, extensively reworking and extending\r\nthem: [1]\r\n\r\nAt first it seemed GCC and the Apple SDK is \"naturally\" growing more\r\nincompatible, as Apple added further non-standard features to their\r\nheaders. This is partly true, but reality is more complicated.\r\n\r\nBesides some issues local to curl, there were bugs in Apple SDK\r\nheaders, Homebrew GCC builds, feature missing in the old llvm version\r\npre-installed on GitHub CI runner images, and subtle incompatibilities\r\nbetween GCC and llvm/clang when handling language extensions.\r\n\r\nResulting compiler errors seldom pointed to a useful direction, and\r\ninternet search was silent about these issues too. Thus, I had to peel\r\nthem off layer by layer, using trial and error, and by recognizing\r\npatterns of failures accross 150-200 builds combinations. Exposing\r\nconfigure logs, and curl_config.h in the CI logs helped too.\r\n\r\n1. GCC header compatibility layer (\"hack\" as GCC calls it)\r\n\r\nThe toughest issue is GCC's built-in compatibility layer:\r\n  https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/fixincludes\r\n\r\nThis patch layer is further patched by a \"Darwin compatibility\" project\r\napplied on top by Homebrew GCC via:\r\n  https://github.com/iains/gcc-12-branch\r\n  https://github.com/iains/gcc-13-branch\r\n  https://github.com/iains/gcc-14-branch\r\n\r\nThe hack layer is designed in a way that breaks more builds than it\r\nfixes, esp. in context of GHA runners. The idea is to build GCC\r\nspecifically for the SDK for the target macOS version. The problem with\r\nthis approach is that the Xcode + SDK installed on the local/CI machine\r\noften does not match with the SDK used on while building GCC on\r\nHomebrew's build machines. In these cases the GCC compatibility layer\r\nturns into an \"uncompatibility\" layer and consistently breaks builds.\r\ncurl cannot offer a fix for this, because the solution (I found) is to\r\npatch the toolchain on the local machine. I implemented this for our CI\r\nbuilds and curl-for-win. In other case the user must do this patching\r\nmanually, or choose a compatible GCC + Xcode/SDK combination.\r\n\r\nAn upstream fix doesn't seem trivial either, because the issue is\r\ningrained in the compatibility layer's design. Offering an `-fapplesdk`\r\n(or recognizing `-target`) option and/or fixing them within the compiler\r\nwould seem like a more robust option, and also how mainline llvm solves\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nHere's a table summarizing the GCC + SDK combinations and curl build\r\nfailures: [2]\r\n\r\nMore info: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/10356#issuecomment-2222734103\r\n\r\ndb135f8d7207b20d531e7e2100a49f3e16bdcfab #14119 macos: add workaround for gcc, non-c-ares, IPv6, compile error\r\nRef: https://github.com/curl/curl-for-win/commit/e2db3c475f5981352e6e6a79854a255805b28deb\r\nRef: https://github.com/curl/curl-for-win/commit/f5c58d7fef78e972be33ca2355dcb42ba56622a6\r\n\r\n2. Homebrew GCC's `availability` extension\r\n\r\nA recent minor Homebrew GCC upgrade caused major breakage. The \"Darwin\r\ncompatibility\" patch applied to GCC implemented the `availability`\r\ncompiler attribute in GCC. Apple SDK detected this and enabled using\r\nthem, but as it turns out GCC accepts compiler attributes with slightly\r\ndifferent rules than llvm/clang, and how the Apple SDK uses them,\r\nbreaking builds.\r\n\r\nAffected Homebrew GCC versions are: 12.4.0, 13.3.0 and 14.1.0.\r\n\r\nPossibly tracked here: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=108796\r\nMore info: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/81767\r\n\r\nCommit implementing the `availability` macro:\r\ngcc-12: https://github.com/iains/gcc-12-branch/commit/fd5530b7cb0012bf4faeddd45e13054a1dfa6783\r\ngcc-13: https://github.com/iains/gcc-13-branch/commit/cb7e4eca68cfc4763474e2eb0935a844458842a8\r\ngcc-14: https://github.com/iains/gcc-14-branch/commit/ff62a108865a6403f5017380d7018250c1d3306f\r\n\r\nThat applied to Homebrew GCC (12.4.0):\r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/b904223d9893f62bec2a8f7483bf5992747fc6c7#diff-89dd0b4176eca7fcc24b591943509bf8a8d6ea904d71e5dfcd6b78fed62fc574R44-R48\r\n\r\nRef: #13700\r\nMore info: https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/14091#issuecomment-2222703468\r\n\r\ne91fcbac7d86292858718a0bfebad57978761af4 #14155 macos: undo `availability` macro enabled by Homebrew gcc\r\n\r\n3. Proprietary Apple SDK macros\r\n\r\nApple SDK expects certain macros predefined by the compiler. Missing\r\nthem may causes odd issues.

Apple SDK header bug\r\n\r\nWithout certain predefined macros, SDK headers can take a codepath where\r\nit mis-defines its own `TARGET_OS_OSX` macro, which makes it break its\r\nown headers later.

GCC missing `__builtin_available()` support\r\n\r\ncurl source code assumes this is available to enable certain codepaths.\r\nIt's also intermixed with monotonic timer support.\r\n\r\n14. Monotonic timer support with GCC\r\n\r\nDetected by GCC, while it probably shouldn't be. llvm/clang detects it\r\ndepending on target OS version. I've been playing with this, but so far\r\nwithout a conclusion or fix.\r\n\r\n15. Runtime/test failures with GCC\r\n\r\nI couldn't find the reason for most of this. A bunch of RTSP tests fail\r\nwith GCC. SecureTransport + HTTP/2 is failing a bunch of tests. With\r\nOpenSSL it fails two of those. SecureTransport builds also fail one DoH\r\ntest.\r\n\r\n16. Runtime/test failure in llvm/clang\r\n\r\nAppleIDN support received a fix with two more remaining.\r\n\r\nfd0250869f7837e4a48d7e6f54cc0801ad3820e8 #14179 #14176 IDN: fix ß with AppleIDN\r\n\r\n17.

These \"lucky\" combinations (GitHub Actions runner) will build out\r\nof the box now: macos-14 + Xcode 15.0.1 + gcc-11, gcc-12, gcc-14. The\r\nrest builds with the ugly workaround in place, but all this still leaves\r\nsome runtime issues.\r\n\r\nMore info and links in the commit messages and source code.\r\n\r\n[1]: This PR:\r\n- add info about target OS version requirements per feature, with OS\r\n  names and release years.\r\n- stop using `-Wno-deprecated-declarations` to suppress warnings.\r\n- use `LDFLAGS=-w` to suppress 'object file was built for newer macOS\r\n  version than being linked' warnings.\r\n  (there were tens of thousands of them in some jobs)\r\n- allow overriding Xcode version in all jobs.\r\n- improve job names.\r\n- abbreviate CMake as CM, autotools as AM for more compact job names.\r\n- shorten job names by using `!` instead of `no-` and `non-`.\r\n- bump parellel tests to 10 (from 5).\r\n- drop using `--enable-maintainer-mode` `./configure` option.\r\n- add gcc-12 no-ssl, autotools job with tests, ignore failing test\r\n  results. (It's not yet clear why gcc-12 builds have different runtime\r\n  results than clang/llvm ones.)\r\n- add comments with OS names and release years next to version numbers,\r\n  e.g. 10.15  # Catalina (2019)\r\n- fix broken gcc-12 SecureTransport build.\r\n- show compiler, Xcode, SDK, gcc hack SDK versions, Homebrew\r\n  preinstalled packages and C compiler predefined macros for each job.\r\n  Useful for debugging all the strange problems these builds might have.\r\n- merge brew bundle and install steps.\r\n- move step names to the top.\r\n- dump configure log for both cmake and autotools also for successful\r\n  builds. Useful for debugging.\r\n- dump curl_config.h in short (sorted #defines) and full form.\r\n- add support for the mainline llvm compiler.\r\n- set sysroot for gcc and llvm.\r\n- add timeout for cmake jobs.\r\n- add new job matrix: combinations\r\n  It supports building all possible compiler, runner image, Xcode/SDK\r\n  combinations, with cmake and autotools, target OS versions and with or\r\n  without SecureTransport. It's quick. GHA limits the maximum number of\r\n  matrix jobs at 256.\r\n  I used this as a test-rig to fix the macOS build fallouts with gcc and\r\n  llvm.\r\n  I settled with 16 jobs, trying to maximize fallout coverage.\r\n- implement hack to make Homebrew gcc work with all available SDKs.\r\n- add handy mini-table about Xcode / SDK versions, OS names, years for\r\n  each GHA images, with the defaults.\r\n- add tests for cmake jobs.\r\n- make cmake config hack to link GnuTLS less intrusive.\r\n- stop ignoring test 1452, seems fine now.\r\n- fix to enable libpsl in autotools builds.\r\n- enable libpsl in cmake builds.\r\n- add an llvm job with tests (both autotools and cmake).\r\n- delete similar macOS jobs from Circle CI. GHA is now arm64 too.\r\n\r\n[2]: Homebrew GCC vs GHA runner images vs curl builds:\r\n```\r\nmacOS      Xcode   gcc         gcc SDK hacks      Xcode SDK   SDK major Build Compile\r\n
