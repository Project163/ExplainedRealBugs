RFC 3501's formal syntax section states: \"Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-insensitive... Implementations MUST accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.\" [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501)\n\n    -   The CAPABILITY response is a space-separated list of capability names. It must include `IMAP4rev1`, and it uses atoms for items like `STARTTLS`, `LOGINDISABLED`, and `AUTH=<mechanism>`. Clients MUST NOT issue `LOGIN` if `LOGINDISABLED` is advertised. Since these are atoms, the case-insensitive rule applies when matching them. [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501)\n\n    -   The grammar explicitly defines `auth-type = atom`, which again inherits the case-insensitive rule. That means `AUTH=plain` and `AUTH=PLAIN` must be treated the same by a client. [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501)\n\n    -   The STARTTLS extension for IMAP is advertised as the `STARTTLS` capability and invoked with the `STARTTLS` command. Whether a server prints `STARTTLS` or `starttls`, a conforming client has to recognize it. [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2595)\n\n    -   The `SASL-IR` capability (initial client response) is defined by RFC 4959. Like all capability atoms, it is matched case-insensitively.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nused a server which uses lowercase keywords in imap\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\nall\n\n### operating system\n\nall","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
