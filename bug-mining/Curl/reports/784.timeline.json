the curl tool.\r\n\r\nTo enable:\r\n- autotools: `--enable-ca-native-by-default`\r\n- cmake: `-DCURL_CA_NATIVE_BY_DEFAULT=ON`\r\n- CPPFLAGS: `-DCURL_CA_NATIVE_BY_DEFAULT`\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, consider disabling implicit on-disk CA bundles, to avoid\r\nauto-loading potentially outdated, redundant bundles from unsafe, \r\nworld-writable, paths:\r\n- autotools: `--disable-ca-search`\r\n- cmake: `-DCURL_DISABLE_CA_SEARCH=ON`\r\n- CPPFLAGS: `-DCURL_DISABLE_CA_SEARCH`\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, native CA can be disabled at run-time with\r\nthe `--no-ca-native` and/or `--no-proxy-ca-native` command-line options.\r\n\r\nRationale: This build option:\r\n- has a repeat and active interest from packagers and users.\r\n- helps integrating curl with Windows for those who need this.\r\n- may also apply to macOS: #17525\r\n- makes it trivial to use custom certs configured on the OS.\r\n- frees applications/packagers/users from the task of securely\r\n  distributing, and keeping up-to-date, a CA bundle.\r\n- frees potentially many curl tool users from configuring a CA bundle\r\n  manually to access HTTPS (and other TLS) URLs. This is traditionally\r\n  difficult on Windows because there is no concept of a universal,\r\n  protected, non-world-writable, location on the file system to securely\r\n  store a CA bundle.\r\n- allows using modern features regardless of Windows version. Some of\r\n  these features are not supported with Schannel (e.g. HTTP/3, ECH) on\r\n  any Windows version.\r\n- is necessary for HTTP/3 builds, where bootstrapping a CA bundle is not\r\n  possible with Schannel, because MultiSSL is not an option, and HTTP/3\r\n  is not supported with Schannel.\r\n\r\nRef: #16181 (previous attempt)\r\nRef: https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/9348\r\nRef:

don't disagree, but I'd even abstract from that. The actual on-disk format doesn't really matter as long as the crypto lib is able to access it. Consider it opaque to you. This suffices my understanding of \"native\". Both wolfSSL and GnuTLS do the same magic in the source code as OpenSSL does with the fallback. I see no reason why the `openssl.c` should not have \"native\" for non-Windows and \"fallback\" removed at some point.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3214874504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"michael-o","id":573017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/573017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-o/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-22T16:05:47Z","updated_at":"2025-08-22T16:05:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18365","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18365/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18365/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18365/events","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/18365","id":3345955468,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAiu0c6k6S1c","number":18365,"title":"cmake:
