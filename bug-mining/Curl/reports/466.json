A perfectly sensible choice nowadays then is to set CURLOPT_SSLVERSION to CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_2, which has, thus far, meant allowing either TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3, with HTTP3/QUIC naturally using TLSv1.3 as defined.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately 8.8.0 shipped with a new mistaken check in [/lib/vtls/openssl.c](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/837378309860839496d2c7429d5befa7faac538c/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3581) that confuses the minimum TLS version for the maximum.\r\nFor anything other than HTTP3, [lib]curl 8.8.0 continues to work fine and automatically uses TLSv1.3 or v1.2 when set to `CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_2`, as expected.\r\n\r\nExample (assuming quictls/nghttp3/ngtcp2 build):\r\n```\r\n$ curl --tlsv1.2 --http3-only https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace\r\n\r\ncurl: (35) QUIC needs at least TLS version 1.3\r\n```\n\n### I expected the following\n\nProper functioning with no error message, since we only requested a _minimum_ of TLSv1.2, and did not specify `--tls-max 1.2` or lower.\r\nIt now fails even if you spell out the maximum as v1.3: `curl --tls-max 1.3 --tlsv1.2 --http3-only https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace`\r\n\r\nHTTP3 now only works if you outright set either a minimum of 1.3, or leave `CURLOPT_SSLVERSION` set as `CURL_SSLVERSION_DEFAULT`.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.8.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin) libcurl/8.8.0 quictls/3.0.13 zlib/1.2.12 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.6 libidn2/2.3.7 libssh/0.10.6/openssl/zlib nghttp2/1.62.1 ngtcp2/1.5.0 nghttp3/1.3.0\r\nRelease-Date: 2024-05-22\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n\n### operating system\n\nNot OS dependent (but tested on Darwin 23.5.0 ie. macOS Sonoma 14.5 23F79)","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
