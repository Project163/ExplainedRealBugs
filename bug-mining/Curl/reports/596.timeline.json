you please have a way for curl to work with both `-C -` and `-r` ?\r\n\r\n1. Say I'm downloading a file `curl -s -r 11-20 https://curl.se/robots.txt -o test.file`\r\n\r\n2. But the download is interrupted due to whatever reason(or maybe I manually stopped it) after 5 bytes.\r\n\r\n3. There is also no way for me use curl to just download and append byte range 16-20 to the same file.\r\nRunning with continue – `curl -r 10-20 -C - -s https://curl.se/robots.txt -o test.file` used to(before you solved this issue) just overwrite the file.\r\n\r\n4. What I expect to happen here is that curl recognizes the size of the downloaded file(`test.file`), knows that 5 bytes have already been downloaded to `test.file` , and correctly resumes a range specified transfer where it left off(automatically transferring `-r 16-20`), instead of re-downloading the full range(`-r 11-20`) .\r\n\r\nBasically I'm requesting an override option, so that `-C -` is able to work with `-r` , when `-o test.file` is specified
