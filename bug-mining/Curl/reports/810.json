In multiplexed HTTP/3, this mislabels the state: the truly blocked stream is left unmarked while an unrelated stream is flagged as flow-blocked. This can cause the wrong request to be paused/woken and the actually blocked stream to stall until unrelated activity nudges scheduling again. \n\nWhy this is wrong\nNGTCP2_ERR_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED is a per-stream condition (flow control on that specific stream_id). Handling it must update the state for that exact stream, not whatever x->data happens to point to at the moment. \n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurrent version\n\n### operating system\n\nall of them","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18905/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
