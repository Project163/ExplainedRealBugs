Nixpkgs version\n\n- Stable (24.11)\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n`.passthru.fetch-deps` of buildDotnetModule output suddenly started failing silently.\nI debugged it with `set -x`  and found the cause of the problem is curl invocation with `--netrc` failed because no `~/.netrc`.\n\nsee below lines of code in fetch-deps:\n```\n  17   │ HOME=$TMPDIR/home\n  18   │ mkdir \"$HOME\"\n```\nand below lines of code in nuget-to-json:\n```\n  40   │     base_address=$(\n  41   │         curl --compressed --netrc -fsL \"$index\" |\n  42   │             jq -r '.resources[] | select(.\"@type\" == \"PackageBaseAddress/3.0.0\").\"@id\"'\n  43   │     )\n```\n\nwhen I add `-v` to curl invocation I got this error:\n```\n++ curl -v --compressed --netrc -fsL https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\n++ jq -r '.resources[] | select(.\"@type\" == \"PackageBaseAddress/3.0.0\").\"@id\"'\n* .netrc error: no such file\n* closing connection #-1\n```\n\nremoving `--netrc` fixed the problem. why is `--netrc` there?\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\"$(nix build --no-link --print-out-paths &lt;PACKAGE&gt;.passthru.fetch-deps)\" &lt;DEPS&gt;.json\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nfetch-deps works\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```console\n\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### System metadata\n\n - system: `\"x86_64-linux\"`\n - host os: `Linux
