took a look at this, it seems all IMAP custom commands (ones set via `-X` rather than letting curl build them up itself) get sent via `imap_perform_list`, so their responses are handled by `imap_state_listsearch_resp`.\n\nThere is logic to parse out the download size from the IMAP response and call `Curl_xfer_setup_recv` to get the content in `imap_state_fetch_resp`, but `imap_state_listsearch_resp` just writes the IMAP response line itself, and doesn't call `Curl_xfer_setup_recv` to get the body.\n\nOne (potentially hacky) solution could be to add the download logic in the fetch response handler to the list/search response handler, possibly by breaking that logic out into a separate method and calling it from both response handlers.\n\nThe other approach I can think of would be to update `imap_perform_fetch` to also be able to handle custom commands, rather than shoehorning them all through the list logic.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3417778197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tiymat","id":138939221,"node_id":"U_kgDOCEgLVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138939221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat","html_url":"https://github.com/tiymat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiymat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20506266654,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c7PqG1bzwAAAATGRMwe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20506266654","actor":{"login":"thebitbrine","id":10282676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgyNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10282676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine","html_url":"https://github.com/thebitbrine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"be3882cc12bb2c5e5ad97c146276e69df6947733","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thebitbrine/curl/commits/be3882cc12bb2c5e5ad97c146276e69df6947733","created_at":"2025-10-26T04:39:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20506272538,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c7PqG1bzwAAAATGROMa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20506272538","actor":{"login":"thebitbrine","id":10282676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgyNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10282676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine","html_url":"https://github.com/thebitbrine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c86c45757cb8cf3a6be4a016c209dd25e0dffd0b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thebitbrine/curl/commits/c86c45757cb8cf3a6be4a016c209dd25e0dffd0b","created_at":"2025-10-26T04:41:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"thebitbrine","id":10282676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgyNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10282676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine","html_url":"https://github.com/thebitbrine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thebitbrine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-26T04:42:10Z","updated_at":"2025-10-26T04:42:10Z","source":

Summary\r\n\r\nFixes #18847\r\n\r\nCustom IMAP commands using `-X` (e.g. `curl -X 'FETCH 123 BODY[1]'`) were only returning the first line of responses containing literals, instead of the full multi-line body data.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nCustom commands route through `imap_perform_list()` and `imap_state_listsearch_resp()`, which didn't detect or handle IMAP literal syntax `{size}\\r\\n` followed by literal data.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n**lib/imap.c - imap_state_listsearch_resp():**\r\n- Added literal detection using same parsing logic as regular FETCH\r\n- Writes response header line containing the literal marker\r\n- Handles literal body data already in the pingpong buffer\r\n- Sets up transfer layer to read remaining literal data from socket\r\n- Configures maxdownload and transfer size to include header + body\r\n\r\n**lib/imap.c - imap_done():**\r\n- Added check for custom commands with downloads: `(imap->custom && data->req.maxdownload > 0)`\r\n- Allows custom FETCH-like commands to transition to FETCH_FINAL state\r\n\r\n**tests/data/test841:**\r\n- Updated expected output to include full literal body\r\n- Test now verifies the fix works correctly\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nVerified with extensive test suite:\r\n- 39/39 IMAP tests pass (800-849) - 100%\r\n- All custom request tests pass\r\n- No regressions in existing functionality\r\n\r\n## Before/After\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n```\r\n* 123 FETCH (BODY[1] {70}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n```\r\n* 123 FETCH (BODY[1] {70}\r\nbody\r\n\r\n+ Curl did not used to like this

and fixed the issue. The problem was that custom commands route through `imap_state_listsearch_resp()` which didn't detect IMAP literal syntax `{size}`.\n\nAdded literal detection to that handler. It now parses the `{size}` marker, writes the header line, handles any buffered data, and sets up the transfer layer to read the literal body. Also updated `imap_done()` to transition custom FETCH commands to FETCH_FINAL state.\n\nTested with the full IMAP test suite: no regressions. Your use case should work now:\n```\ncurl imaps://imap.example.org:993/INBOX -X 'UID FETCH 1 (BODY.PEEK[TEXT])' -u user:password\n```\n\nNow it will return the full response including the literal body
