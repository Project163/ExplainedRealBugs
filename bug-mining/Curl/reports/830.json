   ssh: move easy handle/connection protocol structs to meta\n\n     \n    Closes #17273\n\n```\nI've attached test code that reproduces the issue, when I run this through valgrind against the host version of curl (ubuntu 8.5.0) I get no leaks but when running against curl master it leaks as above but the problem doesn't seem to be present in version 8.13.0 but is in 8.14.0\n\n```\ngcc

./curl_test\n```\nThis test app uploads 100 test files using gstreamer via sftp, the destination URL is hard-coded in the main function and username/password is also hard-coded so change to appropriate values.\n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\nWARNING: this libcurl is Debug-enabled, do not use in production\n\ncurl 8.17.0-DEV
