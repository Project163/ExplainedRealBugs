this year we changed our own stderr variable to use the standard\r\nname `stderr` (to avoid bugs where someone is using `stderr` instead of\r\nthe curl-tool specific variable). This solution needed to override the\r\nstandard `stderr` symbol via the preprocessor. This in turn didn't play\r\nwell with unity builds and caused curl tool to crash or stay silent due\r\nto an uninitialized stderr. This was a hard to find issue, fixed by\r\nmanually breaking out one file from the unity sources.\r\n\r\nTo avoid two these two tricks, this patch implements a different\r\nsolution: Restore using our own local variable for our stderr output and\r\nleave `stderr` as-is. To avoid using `stderr` by mistake, add a\r\n`checksrc` rule (based on logic we already used in lib for `strerror`)\r\nthat detects any `stderr` use in `src` and points to using our own\r\nvariable instead: `tool_stderr`.\r\n\r\nFollow-up to 06133d3e9b8aeb9e9ca0b3370c246bdfbfc8619e\r\nFollow-up to 2f17a9b654121dd1ecf4fc043c6d08a9da3522db\r\n\r\nCloses #11958\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTOTEST: See how this work when running tests.
