Now waiting for the next release...\n\nBTW, I really doubt anyone will explicitly use `--ciphers` while using HTTP/3, but I configured both `ciphers` and `tls13-ciphers` in `~/.curlrc` and then I encountered this issue.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to undo the `ciphers` and `tls13-ciphers` in the config file. Maybe `--no-ciphers` and `--no-tls13-ciphers` or something like that?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2644204486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zzq1015","id":7034960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzQ5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7034960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015","html_url":"https://github.com/zzq1015","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzq1015/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"travislee89","id":3657484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTc0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3657484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89","html_url":"https://github.com/travislee89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travislee89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-14T05:08:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-14T05:08:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stunnel/static-curl/issues/114","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stunnel/static-curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stunnel/static-curl/issues/114/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stunnel/static-curl/issues/114/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stunnel/static-curl/issues/114/events","html_url":"https://github.com/stunnel/static-curl/issues/114","id":2836263691,"node_id":"I_kwDOH-OeYM6pDfML","number":114,"title":"HTTP/3
