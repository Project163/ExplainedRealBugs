Recently one of the content providers provides the content under random subdomains. The subdomain names are \"numeric\", so it's just a chain of numbers. I learned it from the error log and by reproducing the behavior with curl directly from the command line. When pinpointing it down to the subdomain I looked up the rfc for domain names and learned that domain name parts must start with a letter. But I do not have control over the content provider (so that he changes the subdomain names he uses) nor the tool (i.e. that it uses another library to retrieve the content). \r\nI checked the
