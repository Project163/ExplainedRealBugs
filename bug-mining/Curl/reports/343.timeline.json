@lidel \r\nTo summarize, there's actually a couple bugs here (will add testcases for each):\r\n\r\n- `curl ipfs://<cid>/a/b/c` would be handled as `curl ipfs://<cid>`\r\n- `curl ipfs://<cid>?arg=val` would be handled as `curl ipfs://<cid>`\r\n- `curl ipfs://<cid>/a/b/c?arg=val` would be handled as `curl ipfs://<cid>`\r\n\r\nThis is because we only use the `HOST` and `SCHEME` part from the user input, anything else is ignored.\r\nI'm now rewriting this to take the input url as base and \"add in\" the gateway, which is the complete opposite approach of what was done before.\r\n\r\nTricky part, what to do with gateways containing a `PATH` and/or `QUERY`. I'm going to maintain the path but throw a malformed URL if the gateway contains a query. As mixing the query from 2 url's is just asking for needless complexity. This also means that magic gateway query arguments won't be possible anymore. Imho, that's fine because it should - and can! - be done through headers instead.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the same for IPNS, same code path. A fix for one fixes it for the other.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1767254728/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"markg85","id":49061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85","html_url":"https://github.com/markg85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10684353788,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c50HF3BzwAAAAJ81kz8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/10684353788","actor":{"login":"lidel","id":157609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzYwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel","html_url":"https://github.com/lidel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-17T21:57:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10684353796,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c50HF3BzwAAAAJ81k0E","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/10684353796","actor":{"login":"lidel","id":157609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzYwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel","html_url":"https://github.com/lidel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-17T21:57:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1767323799","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12148#issuecomment-1767323799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12148","id":1767323799,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5pVziX","user":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-17T23:01:05Z","updated_at":"2023-10-17T23:01:05Z","body":"The

An example of how that would look:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCURLU *dest = ...\r\nCURLU *otherUrl = ...\r\n\r\n/* init, etc... */\r\n\r\nif(curl_url_set(dest, CURLUPART_HOST, otherUrl, CURLU_URLENCODE) != CURLUE_OK) {\r\n  /* error handling */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe intent in the above example is to get the `CURLUPART_HOST` from the `otherUrl` and put it in the `dest` url object.\r\n\r\nBut this is just replacing.\r\nThings get hairy if you want to append/prepend with for example combining paths. That - as it is now - requires you to get the path part from both url's, do checks on it (like to prevent double slashes). That quickly gets quite a bit. It would be super if the curl API would instead allow the above with a prepend/append flag too. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCURLU *dest = ... /* say http://localhost/a/b */\r\nCURLU *otherUrl = ... /* say https://curl.se/foo/bar */\r\n\r\n/* init, etc... */\r\n\r\nif(curl_url_set(dest, CURLUPART_PATH | CURLUPART_PREPEND, otherUrl, CURLU_URLENCODE) != CURLUE_OK) {\r\n  /* error handling */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the `CURLUPART_PREPEND`. What this should do is `prepend` the `path` part from `otherUrl` to `dest`.\r\nSo dest would become: `http://localhost/foo/bar/a/b`\r\nIn an hypothetical `CURLUPART_APPEND` the result would become `http://localhost/a/b/foo/bar`\r\n\r\nThen again, what i'm doing with an url here is probably as much of an edge case as it can be.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1768249413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"markg85","id":49061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85","html_url":"https://github.com/markg85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markg85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10691554023,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c50HF3BzwAAAAJ9RCrn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/10691554023","actor":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-18T11:27:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10691554034,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c50HF3BzwAAAAJ9RCry","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/10691554034","actor":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-18T11:27:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1768897646","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12148#issuecomment-1768897646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12148","id":1768897646,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5pbzxu","user":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-18T16:22:18Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T16:22:18Z","body":"I

msg:\r\n```\r\nPreviously just ipfs://<cid> and ipns://<cid> was supported. Which is too strict for some usecases.\r\n\r\nThis patch allows paths and query arguments to be used too. Making this work according to normal http semantics: ipfs://<cid>/foo/bar?key=val\r\nipns://<cid>/foo/bar?key=val\r\n\r\nThe gateway url support is changed.\r\nIt now only supports gateways in the form of:\r\nhttp://<gateway>/foo/bar\r\nhttp://<gateway>\r\n\r\nQuery arguments here are explicitly not allowed and trigger an intended malformed url error.\r\n\r\nThere also was a crash when IPFS_PATH was set with a non trailing forward slash. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\nLastly, a load of test cases have been added to verify the above.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12148 and a couple more issues that had been found.\r\n\r\nI've added a lot of testcases to verify the fixes.\r\nStill, the testing isn't super elaborate (say everything for ipfs, then another time for ipns and then everything 3x for the 3 different ways to set a gateway). The reasoning is that much code is following the same path so an issue popping up for ipns will be there for ipfs too. As long as that stays as-is then those current tests cover a lot :)\r\n\r\ncc @lidel

not sold on the arguments here for extending the URL API, but I am certainly open for discussing extending and improving it.\r\n\r\nI think the examples in this thread are a little too specific for this exact use case and shows the problem: sure, if the API provided these functions with exact these properties that would help this particular use case, but when adding combined actions, decisions have to be made and it is not certain those decisions will be fine for everyone and then people will end up having to write it themselves anyway, just leaving us with code that can rarely actually be
