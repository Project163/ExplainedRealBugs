is being changed (the perl script runs in the `/curl/src/curl-8.6.0/docs/cmdline-opts` directory) and there is a race between the 32 and 64-bit builds to create/move the temp file in the common source tree, rather than working in their output trees of `/curl/32` and `/curl/64` respectively. For some reason with 8.6.0 that race seems to be more competitive!\r\n\r\nI will change my build process so that the two parallel builds have their own modifiable source trees to confirm that resolves the issue.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1920877126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jonrumsey","id":25487366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDg3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25487366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey","html_url":"https://github.com/jonrumsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrumsey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1920890901","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12829#issuecomment-1920890901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12829","id":1920890901,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5yfngV","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-01T09:31:50Z","updated_at":"2024-02-01T09:31:50Z","body":"We
