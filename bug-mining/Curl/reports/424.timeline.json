Is it a good idea? I don’t know 🤷. But this StackOverflow answer has 600+ upvotes: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14614203/2010616\r\n- That “elm-tooling” thing I linked to uses curl to download stuff. The checksums fail with that extra newline appended.\r\n- I added `-w \"\"` as a workaround for people with `-w \"\\n\"` in their .curlrc. Are there more things that people can set in .curlrc that will mess with my download script? Probably. Has anyone complained? None so far.\r\n- I don’t want to use `-q` because if people configure proxy stuff in .curlrc I want that to be used.\r\n\r\nIs it a bug? I’ll leave that to the maintainers to judge. Either way, here’s my workaround:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-w \"%{stderr}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n`%{stderr}` doesn’t print anything of itself, it just makes the rest of the`-w` string get written to stderr. “The rest of the string” is nothing in this case. So in practice this has the same effect as the empty string, without being empty

I did this\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl \"\" --silent www.example.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I saw an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl: option : blank argument where content is expected\r\ncurl: try 'curl --help' for more information\r\n```\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\nCurl to run as if I had passed it `curl --silent www.example.com` based on https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/13144 (I think it was also introduced with 07bcae89d5d0090f1d11866d5f9c98c3720a2838), though similar to there I'm not sure if this is a bug or intentional behaviour but thought I'd post all the same for visibility, given there is a behaviour change.\r\n\r\nbuilding at `07bcae89d5d0090f1d11866d5f9c98c3720a2838~` (i.e. f59223f500ebeee8ef6d882242fd4418f9e96c52) and I see the following behaviour:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ ./src/curl \"\" www.example.com >/dev/null\r\ncurl: (3) URL rejected: Malformed input to a URL function\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n

>/dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\nI.e. the request to `www.example.com` is made in both cases and the `--silent` option is used in the second.\r\n\r\n\r\nI noticed this behaviour as a result of https://github.com/karancode/kustomize-github-action/issues/46. The root cause of that is the `curl` invocation https://github.com/karancode/kustomize-github-action/blob/883a86ec3535e4e7d0fe6450a85f8325c97d2a7b/src/entrypoint.sh#L54 where `${with_token[@]}\"` being empty it will result in a `\"\"` in the args.\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl --version\r\ncurl 8.8.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.8.0 OpenSSL/3.3.1 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.6 libidn2/2.3.7 libpsl/0.21.5 libssh2/1.11.0 nghttp2/1.62.1 nghttp3/1.3.0\r\nRelease-Date: 2024-05-22\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested with the same result at current `master` (04739054cdac5a0614fb94e3655e313c03399f35)\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nArch Linux  6.6.32-1-lts","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13966/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
