this would make setting `CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB` to an empty string equivalent to \"un-setting\" it with a null pointer value. Which is kind-of the opposite of what we want. We want to use `CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB` to give a final set of certificates (which may be empty) to curl in a way so that it won't add any default/fallback certificates. If `verifypeer` is off then the request should still succeed, and if `verifypeer` is on then we _want_ it to fail. And from what I could tell, this is exactly what curl 7.86 did.\r\n\r\nAlso IMO the behavior should be the same regardless of whether `CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB` designates an empty string or a non-empty

This change would restore curl's behavior to the behavior that existed in curl 7.86.0. This means that certificates provided to the `CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB` setting will be added to OpenSSL's `X509_STORE` structures even if certificate validation is disabled. This behavior can be useful for applications that make use of `CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION`, but don't want to manually populate OpenSSL's root certificate database themselves. The dependency between certificate verification and root certificate importing appears to have been introduced when [curl issue #10351](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/10351) merged.\r\n\r\n## Why _this_ change?\r\n\r\nIf an application is using `CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION` to perform some custom validation, this application may want curl to not perform automatic certificate validation but would still want curl to load the supplied certificates into the `SSL_CTX` structure. This change will also ensure that the `CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB` and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` options remain independent.\r\n\r\nFor example the `ossl_custom_verify.c` has a rudimentary example of an application directly making use of OpenSSL's verify callback to log the certificate chain for every request. However applications could implement additional custom validation if they want to perform additional non-standard certificate validation. An application upgrading to curl 7.88.0 or newer would experience failures if configured with `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER==0` and a certificate provided through `CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB`. However this application would work if `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER==1` despite there being no changes made to the actual certificate verification functionality.\r\n\r\nI wrote a 2 examples and used Docker to test these examples with curl versions 7.86.0, 7.87.0, 7.88.0, and the behavior after merging my proposed fix.\r\n\r\n## 7.86.0 Behavior\r\n\r\nIn 7.86.0, observe that the request from both `test_verify.c` and `ossl_custom_verify.c` code get `200 OK` responses as expected.\r\n\r\nUsing GDB, the behavior around the [ossl_connect_step1](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/cd95ee9f771361acf241629d2fe5507e308082a2/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L2894) and [load_cacert_from_memory](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/cd95ee9f771361acf241629d2fe5507e308082a2/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L2833) functions can be examined more closely. With `ca_info_blob->len == 0`, no certificates are imported and `load_cacert_from_memory` returns `CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE`. In `ossl_connect_step1`, the `result` is checked on [line 3347](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/cd95ee9f771361acf241629d2fe5507e308082a2/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3347) and again on line 3348. Since this is not one of the conditions that would execute the body of the [if statement on line 3348](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/cd95ee9f771361acf241629d2fe5507e308082a2/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3348), curl continues processing the remainder of the request.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) b load_cacert_from_memory\r\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x7ffff7f6d1af: file vtls/openssl.c, line 2837.\r\n(gdb) p *ca_info_blob\r\n$2 = {data = 0x55555556f540, len = 0, flags = 1}\r\n(gdb) finish\r\nRun till exit from #0  load_cacert_from_memory (ctx=0x5555555f63b0, ca_info_blob=0x55555556f528) at vtls/openssl.c:2891\r\n0x00007ffff7f6e716 in ossl_connect_step1 (data=0x5555555733e8, conn=0x55555556cb48, sockindex=0) at vtls/openssl.c:3346\r\n3346        result = load_cacert_from_memory(backend->ctx, ca_info_blob);\r\nValue returned is $5 = CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE\r\n(gdb) n\r\n3347        if(result) {\r\n(gdb) n\r\n3348          if(result == CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY ||\r\n(gdb) n\r\n3354          infof(data, \"error importing CA certificate blob, continuing anyway\");\r\n(gdb) finish\r\nRun till exit from #0  ossl_connect_step1 (data=0x5555555733e8, conn=0x55555556cb48, sockindex=0) at vtls/openssl.c:3358\r\n0x00007ffff7f7115e in ossl_connect_common (data=0x5555555733e8, conn=0x55555556cb48, sockindex=0, nonblocking=true, done=0x7fffffffe31d) at vtls/openssl.c:4059\r\n4059        result = ossl_connect_step1(data, conn, sockindex);\r\nValue returned is $6 = CURLE_OK\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `result` local variable is not checked again, and the `ossl_connect_step1` function [returns `CURLE_OK`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/cd95ee9f771361acf241629d2fe5507e308082a2/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3564). The request continues from here.\r\n\r\n## 7.87.0 Behavior\r\n\r\nRunning `ossl_custom_verify.c` against 7.87.0 succeeds. However `test_verify.c` returns a `CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE` error before the request is sent. The behavior causing `test_verify.c` to fail was fixed when curl 7.88.0 released by [curl issue #10351](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/10351).\r\n\r\nCurl version 7.87.0 released a [major refactor](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3c16697ebd796f799227be293e8689aec5f8190d) of the code that loads certificates. This results in [ossl_connect_step1](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3473) calling [set_up_x509_store](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3776) to call [populate_x509_store](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3454) to call [load_cacert_from_memory](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3246). With a breakpoint set on [line 3247](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3247) we can observe the behavior of these functions that leads to `ossl_connect_step1` returning `CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE`.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nThread 1 \"a.out\" hit Breakpoint 1, populate_x509_store (cf=0x55555556fc18, data=0x5555555733e8, store=0x5555555f6e50) at vtls/openssl.c:3247\r\n3247        if(result) {\r\n(gdb) n\r\n3248          if(result == CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY ||\r\n(gdb) n\r\n3254          infof(data, \"error importing CA certificate blob, continuing anyway\");\r\n(gdb) until 3340\r\npopulate_x509_store (cf=0x55555556fc18, data=0x5555555733e8, store=0x5555555f6e50) at vtls/openssl.c:3340\r\n3340      return result;\r\n(gdb) p result\r\n$1 = CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `populate_x509_store` function returns the `CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE` error to `set_up_x509_store`. The `set_up_x509_store` function [also returns](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3454-L3460) `CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE` to its caller `ossl_connect_step1`. Since `ossl_connect_step1` has received an error it will [return this error to its caller](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3776-L3778) and the request will fail. However this appears to conflict with the info message that would be logged on [line 3254 of lib/vtls/openssl.c](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/c12fb3ddaf48e709a7a4deaa55ec485e4df163ee/lib/vtls/openssl.c#L3254) stating that the request is continuing anyway in spite of the error importing the CA blob.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 7.88.0 and newer Behavior\r\n\r\nTo address the behavior emerging in 7.87.0, [a change was made to populate_x509_store](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/10359/commits/a3bcfab4b577dde2ddac0f25bbe872037dd81d23) that will only attempt to load certificates if `verifypeer` is true. However this appears to introduce a new dependency between these settings rather than returning to the behavior that 7.86.0 exhibited. GDB confirms that the `load_cacert_from_memory` function is not called at all. This means that the behavior of the `CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB` option is now dependent on the `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` option. This change in behavior leads to the `ossl_custom_verify.c` code failing when run against libcurl 7.88.0 or newer. I believe it would be sufficient to ignore errors configuring certificates on OpenSSL if certificate verification is disabled.\r\n\r\nAn application that makes use of the `CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION` option to directly modify OpenSSL's SSL context now would have to directly import its own certificates into OpenSSL. If not modified, the change in curl behavior results in certificate failures in the application since the certificate chain cannot be verified.\r\n\r\n## Behavior after merging this PR\r\n\r\nAfter merging this PR the code behaves as it originally did in 7.86.0. If non-memory related errors are returned from `load_cacert_from_memory` and `verifypeer` is false, the errors are ignored by setting `result = CURLE_OK`.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/lib/vtls/openssl.c b/lib/vtls/openssl.c\r\nindex c6a1dd218..efd0c1cab 100644\r\n--- a/lib/vtls/openssl.c\r\n+++ b/lib/vtls/openssl.c\r\n@@ -3171,6 +3171,7 @@ static CURLcode populate_x509_store(struct Curl_cfilter *cf,\r\n         return result;\r\n       }\r\n       /* Only warn if no certificate verification is required. */\r\n+      result = CURLE_OK;\r\n       infof(data, \"error importing CA certificate blob, continuing anyway\");\r\n     }\r\n     else {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change resets the `result` local variable to `CURLE_OK` if the if and return statement starting from line 3168 were not executed. This ignores the `CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE` error that was returned from `load_cacert_from_memory` if no certificates were imported. It is my understanding that this is the same behavior that curl 7.86.0 had in this situation.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes are required to make the certificate handling code independent of the value of `verifypeer`.\r\n\r\nRunning curl 7.88.0 with this patch applied results in identical behavior to curl 7.86.0, including adding the root certificate to OpenSSL.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$

detailed issue description in #11456. This PR preserves independence of the `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and `CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB` when using OpenSSL.
