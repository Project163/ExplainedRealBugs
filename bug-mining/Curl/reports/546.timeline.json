[\"--max-filesize\"](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--max-filesize) is applied to the ignored content, of redirect response.\r\n\r\n    E.g.\r\n    `curl -v --max-filesize 1 -L \"http://localhost:8080/\"`\r\n    ; and the server's redirect reply has 5 content bytes:\r\n[[\r\n```shell\r\n\twhile true;\r\n\tdo {\r\n\tperl -e '\r\n\t$, = \"\\r\\n\";\r\n\tprint (\r\n\t\"HTTP/1.1

&#x60;curl&#x60; will fail because 5 bytes of content (though ignored) is more than 1:\r\n[[\r\n&#x2A; STATE: DO => DID handle 0x76bd88; line 2164\r\n&#x2A; STATE: DID => PERFORMING handle 0x76bd88;

\"Curl_http_size\", which AFAICT:\r\n    Compares even for body bytes that are not \"real\" so to speak:\r\n    [ https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4ff04615a095ed1e7c489e3bbd4600b52e68d9a7/lib/http.c#L3273-L3294](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4ff04615a095ed1e7c489e3bbd4600b52e68d9a7/lib/http.c#L3273-L3294)\r\n    .\r\n    There is a separate check that is done in \"cw_download_write\": which deals with real body bytes.\r\n    However by that point the download is already taking place:\r\n    [ https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4ff04615a095ed1e7c489e3bbd4600b52e68d9a7/lib/sendf.c#L326-L344](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4ff04615a095ed1e7c489e3bbd4600b52e68d9a7/lib/sendf.c#L326-L344)\r\n    .\r\n    In other words, the former check causes &#x60;curl&#x60; to error immediately:\r\n    After the headers are received and the content length is known.\r\n\r\n    The user may want this behavior because, if they say:\r\n    Limit to 1 MiB, then maybe they don't want to download the first 1 MiB of a 100 MiB file.\r\n\r\n    On the other hand, it seems that \"cw_download_write\" works in exactly that way:\r\n    It will allow downloading to the maximum file size.\r\n\r\n    So if the former check is removed, which is my initial inclination:\r\n    There will be a change in behavior. ]\r\n.\r\n    See also: [
