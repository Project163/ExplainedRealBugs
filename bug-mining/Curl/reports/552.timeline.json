I did this\r\n\r\n### Intro\r\nWe (c++ software) are using libcurl for communicating with FTP servers\r\nOur tests started to fail with libcurl 8.9.0  and later (8.9.1 and 8.10.1)\r\nThe failing test is downloading a file from the FTP server and does a \"*DELE filename\" in a POSTQUOTE.  But the post quote is never executed (file is downloaded correctly)\r\nWe are using FileZilla Server 0.9.60 beta  (latest version also has the same issue)\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\nTo reproduce I adapted lib505.c  test case to activate the explicit SSL connection\r\nAdded (line120...):\r\ntest_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_USE_SSL, CURLUSESSL_ALL);\r\ntest_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLVERSION, CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_TLSv1_2);\r\ntest_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0L);\r\ntest_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0L);\r\n\r\nAlthough this is uploading (and not downloading) it seems to fail for the same reason (not performing the postquote)\r\n\r\nUsing a sample file 505 (containing some random data)\r\n\r\n### Working case\r\nI ran the lib505.exe with version 8.8.0\r\n**.\\lib505.exe ftp://FTPPlain:PlainPwd@localhost:21/505 .\\505**\r\n\r\n```\r\nURL: ftp://FTPPlain:PlainPwd@localhost:21/505\r\n* !!!

The call to `perform()` finally returns `CURL_PARTIAL_FILE` as the error after a while.\nThe file is actually written to the FTP server - but if I add a `POSTQUOTE` sequence, then it is not executed. \n\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to see the output from the curl trace</summary>\n\n```\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.888 [FTP] [STOP] setup connection -> 0\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.891   Trying 11.22.33.44:1080...\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.892 [TCP] cf_socket_open() -> 0, fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.894 [TCP] local address 0.0.0.0 port 54854...\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.895 [TCP] adjust_pollset, !connected, POLLOUT fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.916 [TCP] connected\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.918 [TCP] send(len=5) -> 5, err=0\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.919 [TCP] recv(len=2) -> -1, err=81\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.920 [TCP] adjust_pollset, !active, POLLIN fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.939 [TCP] recv(len=2) -> 2, err=0\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.941 [TCP] send(len=43) -> 43, err=0\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.943 [TCP] recv(len=2) -> -1, err=81\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.944 [TCP] adjust_pollset, !active, POLLIN fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.964 [TCP] recv(len=2) -> 2, err=0\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.968 [TCP] adjust_pollset, !active, POLLIN fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.970 [TCP] adjust_pollset, !active, POLLIN fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.973 [TCP] adjust_pollset, !active, POLLIN fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.979 [TCP] adjust_pollset, !active, POLLIN fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.46.994 [TCP] adjust_pollset, !active, POLLIN fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.025 Host some.ftpserver.com:21 was resolved.\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.027 IPv6: (none)\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.028 IPv4: 55.66.77.88\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.029 SOCKS5 connect to 55.66.77.88:21 (locally resolved)\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.031 [TCP] send(len=10) -> 10, err=0\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.033 [TCP] recv(len=10) -> -1, err=81\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.034 [TCP] adjust_pollset, !active, POLLIN fd=1660\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.060 [TCP] recv(len=10) -> 10, err=0\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.061 SOCKS5 request granted.\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.063 Connected to 11.22.33.44 () port 1080\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.065 Connected to 11.22.33.44 (11.22.33.44) port 1080\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.066 [FTP] [STOP] -> [WAIT220]\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.068 [TCP] recv(len=900) -> 27, err=0\nCURLINFO_HEADER_IN: 12.35.47.070 220 Microsoft FTP Service\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.072 [TCP] send(len=10) -> 10, err=0\nCURLINFO_HEADER_OUT: 12.35.47.074 AUTH SSL\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.075 [FTP] [WAIT220] -> [AUTH]\nCURLINFO_TEXT: 12.35.47.103 [TCP] recv(len=900) -> 49, err=0\nCURLINFO_HEADER_IN: 12.35.47.105 234 AUTH command ok.

The reason we investigated this is because we had a report from a vendor that was using a version of libcurl prior to b2331f3eeabf6d3d48476040ad8a058c282ddba0, and suggested to us that our server was at fault.
