for opening this as an \"issue\" but it seemed like it might be the easiest place for a conversation. \r\n\r\nI love the conservative use of dependencies in this library but wondered if taking a different tact with [parseDataToObject.js](https://github.com/gr3p1p3/transparent-proxy/blob/91823b290fd3705ce2e49c4fc41013a0f5a5aedf/lib/parseDataToObject.js) might be worthwhile. Specifically, there are nuances around different versions of the http spec (and poor implementations of those specs) that can be challenging to account for and likely out of scope for this project. A few examples that, on a quick read of the current code, might not work as a user expects:\r\n\r\n- Cases where a server uses only a single `LF` as a line terminator (discussion [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5757349))\r\n- Multi-line headers (discussion [here](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/8844))\r\n- Multiple-message header fields (discussion [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3097052))\r\n\r\nAll that to say, I wondered if you'd consider using [http-parser-js](https://github.com/creationix/http-parser-js) (or similar) for message parsing instead of the current method. If not, no worries. If so, I might have a go at it if I can find the time.\r\n\r\nThanks again for a useful library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gr3p1p3/transparent-proxy/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gr3p1p3/transparent-proxy/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
