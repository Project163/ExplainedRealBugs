The open/close callbacks are totally separate and independent from the socket callback.\r\n\r\nYes, but they both involve some bookkeeping about the sockets, and since there are no examples about how to use the socket callback and the open/close callbacks together I somehow got that bookkeeping mixed up, thinking I could get rid of the socket after CURL_POLL_REMOVE (since the socket was \"no longer used by libcurl\"). Which, incidentally, usually works, because curl will try to use the socket descriptor, see that it it's not working, call the close function and then open a new one - but this prevents connection reuse and also will break, I guess, if the same socket descriptor is reused by the operating system.\r\n\r\nThe documentation change makes it a bit easier to get this right.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1291591919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lultimouomo","id":109914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTkxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo","html_url":"https://github.com/lultimouomo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lultimouomo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7670949502,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAiu0c5U0UedzwAAAAHJOWZ-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/7670949502","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"716ad5ea4976f095751a5522118e186b8b6ec31f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/716ad5ea4976f095751a5522118e186b8b6ec31f","created_at":"2022-10-26T09:24:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
