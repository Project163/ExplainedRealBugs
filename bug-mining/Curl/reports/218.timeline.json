However, it could easily be something I have done incorrectly because I am not an expert on C style memory management. My code is here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid read_bam(path bam_path){\r\n    samFile* bam_file = nullptr;\r\n    bam_hdr_t* bam_header = nullptr;\r\n    hts_idx_t* bam_index = nullptr;\r\n    bam1_t* alignment = bam_init1();\r\n\r\n    if ((bam_file = hts_open(bam_path.string().c_str(), \"r\")) == nullptr) {\r\n        throw runtime_error(\"ERROR: Cannot open bam file: \" + bam_path.string());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // bam index\r\n    if ((bam_index = sam_index_load(bam_file, bam_path.string().c_str())) == nullptr) {\r\n        throw runtime_error(\"ERROR: Cannot open index for bam file: \" + bam_path.string() + \"\\n\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // bam header\r\n    if ((bam_header = sam_hdr_read(bam_file)) == nullptr){\r\n        throw runtime_error(\"ERROR: Cannot open header for bam file: \" + bam_path.string() + \"\\n\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    int i = 0;\r\n    while (sam_read1(bam_file, bam_header, alignment) >= 0){\r\n\r\n        // Copy contents of C object into strings\r\n        string read_name = bam_get_qname(alignment);\r\n        string ref_name = bam_header->target_name[alignment->core.tid];\r\n\r\n        cerr << read_name << ' ' << ref_name << '\\n';\r\n\r\n        if (++i == 10){\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    hts_close(bam_file);\r\n    bam_hdr_destroy(bam_header);\r\n    bam_destroy1(alignment);\r\n    hts_idx_destroy(bam_index);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould you let me know if this is a simple mistake on my end or something more serious? I need to run a function like this on many windows repeatedly so this leak would get out of hand pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samtools/htslib/issues/1678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samtools/htslib/issues/1678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jmarshall","id":70921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall","html_url":"https://github.com/jmarshall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-28T07:51:39Z","updated_at":"2023-09-28T07:51:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/8841","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/8841/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/8841/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/8841/events","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/8841","id":1234835349,"node_id":"I_kwDOAAiu0c5JmheV","number":8841,"title":"Memory
