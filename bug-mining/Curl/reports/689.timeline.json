adapts #375030 now that #391402 is merged, as are the `editline` (#391425, #391426) and `capnproto` (#391424) packaging updates.\r\n\r\nSee: https://lix.systems/blog/2025-01-18-lix-2.92-release/\r\n\r\nNote that `lixPackageSets.stable` has not been updated to 2.92 due to a `curl` bug upstream: https://git.lix.systems/lix-project/lix/issues/662\r\n\r\nThis new release introduces a bunch of changes at the packaging level, reliant on new features of Meson and new features of some of our dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here is that it's OK to add more dependencies than required for older versions but not OK to break them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Lix is now load-bearing dependent on the Clang stdenv, it cannot be compiled with GCC anymore.\r\n\r\nAn escape hatch is included (`enableStrictLLVMChecks`) but if this escape hatch is used, the user is on its own and should probably work with GCC upstream to fix miscompilations.\r\n\r\n## Things done\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check what applies.
