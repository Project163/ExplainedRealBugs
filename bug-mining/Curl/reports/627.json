Notably `curl_multi_waitfds` can return more than `curl_multi_fdset`.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI expected these functions to behave in the same way except one is fd_set based, and the other is poll like.\n\nThe difference is both functions return the sockets on the list `multi->process`. However, only `curl_multi_waitfds` returns the sockets associated with `multi->cpool`.\n\nI would expect these functions to operate the same way.
