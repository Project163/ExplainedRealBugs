I am no OpenSSL expert. Just placed a tracepoint after the call of SSL_shutdown() and discovered that it failed frequently in my particular setup (wobbly data link using WiFi or cellular phone network). Then I monitored the number of retries (still with a tracepoint) and found that a *single* retry always fixed the issue, and dispatched the TLS alert close_notify. It just happens to work for me. Limiting the number of iterations would probably make sense, though.About the close_notify alert mandated by TLSv1.3, I discovered that there is much controversy. But I talk to a FileZilla server using GnuTLS, which is adamant that it receive the close_notify before detecting socket closure.\r\nIf my humble suggestion does not make its way into the codebase, this not a big deal for me, I'll just check openssl.c in future versions of curl, and apply my patch for my own needs. I always build curl from sources, so this is not an issue.\r\nWith best regards,Alain\r\n\r\n\r\n   Le lundi 26 juin 2023 à 09:31:29 UTC+2, Stefan Eissing ***@***.***> a écrit :  \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThis looks as if it would block until the SSL stack is actually able to send the close notify.\r\n\r\nIf the outgoing socket is \"full\", EGAIN is returned.

actually do see this issue a lot, especially with FileZilla servers, but also with VSFTP (there, the server response is `426 Failure reading network stream`). Interestingly, this does not happen just at random and at instable wireless connections, but seems to depend solely on the file size and connection speed to the server - and repeated attempts at uploading a file of that particular size all fail in the same way.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I've seen one server where it is impossible to upload a file of size 9977696 bytes. The client always runs on windows 10 and I have no way to run a debug version of curl, just using the \"official\" windows binaries directly from the curl project. However I was able to debug this on the level of Winsock's `send` function - and in cases where the upload fails that way, it's always that the last `send` on the data connection fails with `WSAEWOULDBLOCK`. This of course also happens a lot already  during the actual upload of the file, but those `send`s are properly repeated after waiting for it to unblock, but the last one is not. It seems that this particular server is rather slow, and with just the right file size, the last `send` of the real file data just fills the socket's send buffer enough that the following `send` for the close notify is almost guaranteed to fail... \r\n\r\nSo it would really be nice if a more robust attempt at sending the close_notify could be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1717591672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"2i-mh","id":89904568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTA0NTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89904568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh","html_url":"https://github.com/2i-mh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2i-mh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1718267878","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/11383#issuecomment-1718267878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11383","id":1718267878,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5maq_m","user":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-13T20:23:15Z","updated_at":"2023-09-13T20:23:15Z","body":"> In particular, I've seen one server where it is impossible to upload a file of size 9977696 bytes.
