Since ultimately this is just doing a memcpy from some kernel buffer, in principle this should be able to be reduced to almost zero.  The remainder of the time is split on decryption performed by OpenSSL and other memory copies.  Therefore we expect that the throughput from a single thread could be nearly 2x the current throughput if the excessive small recv calls were eliminated.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if the excessive recv calls could be avoided without additional memory copies -- it is not clear how easily that can be accomplished.  But even if additional memory copies are needed, it is likely to improve performance, because memcpy is much cheaper than a recv call.  Indeed, failing to use buffered I/O when performing small reads from a file descriptor is a classic performance pitfall.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2070658328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jbms","id":4211946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTE5NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4211946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms","html_url":"https://github.com/jbms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbms/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2071710279","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/13416#issuecomment-2071710279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13416","id":2071710279,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c57e8pH","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-23T08:22:46Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T08:23:11Z","body":"I agree that curl can be improved here for better performance in high traffic applications.
