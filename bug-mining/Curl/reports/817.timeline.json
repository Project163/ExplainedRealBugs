> reject HTTP responses with multiple location headers\n> \n> Is this also true if a second header is _identical_ to the first?\n\nYeah good question. Here's a Python program I used to test this:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n#\nimport socket\nimport sys\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    locations = sys.argv[1:]\n    assert len(locations) >= 2, locations\n\n    location_headers = '\\n'.join(f'Location: {location}' for location in locations)\n\n    response_to_serve = f\"\"\"HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nContent-Length: 0\n{location_headers}\n\n\"\"\".replace('\\n', '\\r\\n').encode()\n    print(response_to_serve)\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)\n    sock.bind(('localhost', 8000))\n    sock.listen(10)\n\n    while True:\n        conn, _addr = sock.accept()\n        conn.sendall(response_to_serve)\n        conn.close()\n```\n\n* Same location: `python3 multilocation.py http://asdqwe/foo http://asdqwe/foo`\n* Different locations: `python3 multilocation.py http://asdqwe/foo http://asdqwe/bar`\n\n\n| Browser      | Same location | Different locations |\n| - | - | - |\n| Firefox 144.0 | Redirect to http://asdqwe/foo | Error |\n| Brave 1.83.118 | Redirect to http://asdqwe/foo | Error |\n| Safari 18.3 (not the latest!) | Weird redirect to http://asdqwe/foo,%20http://asdqwe/foo (?) | Error |\n| Chrome 141.0.7390.108 | Redirect to http://asdqwe/foo | Error |\n\nI did some digging and this is what \"RFC 9110 HTTP Semantics\" says (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-location):\n\n> The field value consists of a single URI-reference. \n\nand then\n\n> If an invalid message is sent with multiple Location field lines, a recipient along the path might combine those field lines into one value. Recovery of a valid Location field value from that situation is difficult and not interoperable across implementations.\n\nSo there's that.\n\n> Is [#19134](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/19134) what you have in mind?\n\nYup, it looks good to
