But we have Hitch configured to require MTLS, so if it succeeds, it should be using MTLS.\n\n# Enable Proxy Protocol\n\nThe PROXY protocol was designed to help carry connection information from the source requesting side through a proxy server to the destination, especially when network address translation (NAT) is involved. It provides a way to preserve the original end-user IP addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers when traffic is routed through proxies and load balancers. The information is typically added to the header of the request forwarded to the destination server.\n\nThere are two versions of the PROXY protocol: V1 and V2.\n- V1 is human-readable ASCII, V2 is binary.\n- V1 headers are simpler but more verbose, V2 headers are more flexible and can carry additional information using TLV (Type-Length-Value) vectors..\n- V2 can support protocols other than TCP, e.g., UDP.\nIt needs to be enabled at both Squid and Hitch.\nAdd the following in \"/etc/hitch/hitch.conf\":\n\n```\nproxy-proxy = on\n```\n\nChange \"http_port 3128\" in \"/etc/squid/squid.conf\":\n\n```\nhttp_port 3128 require-proxy-header\nproxy_protocol_access allow localnet\n\n# following one is needed when testing on the same machine\nacl localnet src 127.0.0.1\n```\n\nVerify MTLS setup with curl\n\n```\ncurl --cacert ca.crt --proxy-cert client.crt --proxy-key client.key -x https://www.yourdomain.com:8443 --haproxy-protocol https://myip.ipip.net\n```\n\n# Cert and Key\n\nHere's the step-by-step process for creating a set of certificates to be used for MTLS, including the CA certificate and key, server certificate and key, and client certificate and key. Please replace \"Your CA Name\", \"yourdomain.com\", and \"Your Server Name\" with your actual CA, domain, and server names.\n\n## Step 1: Generate the CA's Private Key\n\n```\nopenssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096\n```\n\nThis creates a new 4096-bit RSA private key for your CA. The key will be stored in ca.key.\n\n## Step 2: Generate the Self-Signed Root CA Certificate\n\n```\nopenssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -subj \"/CN=Your CA Name\"\n```\n\nThis command generates a new self-signed CA certificate based on the private key (ca.key) you created. The -days 3650 makes the certificate valid for 10 years. The certificate will be stored in ca.crt.\n\n## Step 3: Generate the Server's Private Key\n\n```\nopenssl genrsa -out server.key 2048\n```\n\nGenerate a new 2048-bit RSA private key for your server. The key will be stored in server.key.\n\n## Step 4: Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the Server\n\n```\nopenssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj \"/CN=www.yourdomain.com\"\n```\n\nThis creates a new CSR (server.csr) for your server certificate using the server's private key (server.key).\n\n## Step 5: Generate the Server Certificate Signed by Your CA\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt\n```\n\nThis signs the server CSR with your CA key, resulting in a signed server certificate (server.crt) valid for 1 year.\n\n## Step 6: Generate the Client's Private Key\n\n```\nopenssl genrsa -out client.key 2048\n```\n\nGenerate a new 2048-bit RSA private key for the client. This key will be stored in client.key.\n\n## Step 7: Create a CSR for the Client\n\n```\nopenssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr -subj \"/CN=Your Client Name\"\n```\n\nCreate a CSR (client.csr) for the client using the newly created client key (client.key).\n\n## Step 8: Generate the Client Certificate Signed by Your CA\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt\n```\n\nThis signs the client CSR with your CA key, creating a signed client certificate (client.crt) valid for 1 year. This certificate is to be used for mutual TLS authentication by the client.\n\n## Step 9 (optional): Verify the Certificates\n\nTo verify the server and client certificates were signed by your CA:\n\n```\nopenssl verify -CAfile ca.crt server.crt\nopenssl verify -CAfile ca.crt client.crt\n```\n\nBoth commands should return OK if everything went well.\n\nNow you have:\n- CA certificate (ca.crt) installed and trusted on the server and clients.\n- Server certificate (server.crt) and private key (server.key) are installed on the server.\n- Client certificate (client.crt) and private key (client.key) are installed on the client.\n\nMake sure you protect your private keys (ca.key, server.key, client.key) by setting appropriate file permissions. Using these instructions, your server and client can mutually authenticate themselves over a TLS connection, with your own CA acting as the trust anchor.\nThis content is only supported in a Feishu Docs\n\nReference\nhttps://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt\nhttps://seriousben.com/posts/2020-02-exploring-the-proxy-protocol/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiantaoFu/jiantaofu.github.io/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiantaoFu/jiantaofu.github.io/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
