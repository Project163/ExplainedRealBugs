Description\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nI have tried to install below packages on unbuntu 20.04 and mac.\r\nUnbuntu is find. But installing on Mac occurs errors because of libiconv/1.17 on conan v2.\r\nSo, these options was added to avoid boost build error.\r\n```\r\n \"boost/*:i18n_backend_iconv\": \"libc\",\r\n \"boost/*:with_stacktrace_backtrace\": False\r\n```\r\nThen after, all packages were install well on Release - include boost.
