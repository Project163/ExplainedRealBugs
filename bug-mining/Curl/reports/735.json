The command `curl -u user: --anyauth http://localhost` does not, because it first expects to get a 401 code to begin negotiation of the auth method. I would expect the command `curl -u user: --anyauth --no-anyauth http://localhost`, which adds the `--no-anyauth` parameter, to undo the `--anyauth` and cause this command to operate like the first one (and send an `Authorization:` header), but it does not. It operates exactly the same as the previous command. Setting `--basic`, which the documentation says is the default behaviour, instead of `--no-anyauth`, also does nothing to restore the default behaviour.\n\n\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI would expect `--anyauth --no-anyauth` and `--anyauth --basic` to each operate as a no-op, but it appears that once `--anyauth` is given auth negotiation cannot be disabled. Either curl should undo `--anyauth` and restore the default behaviour with one of these options, or, failing that, it should return an `option is unknown` error for `--no-anyauth` if it actually does nothing. The latter would be unfortunate, because it means if `--anyauth` is included in a .curlrc file it cannot be disabled.\n\nThe documentation for the various auth options is inconsistent. `--basic` says\n\n> This method is the default and this option is usually pointless,  unless\n            you use  it  to  override  a  previously set  option  that  sets  a\n            different authentication  method  (such  as  --ntlm,  --digest,  or\n            --negotiate).\n\nwhich implies it should do what I want and override `--anyauth` (although, admittedly, it doesn't mention `--anyauth` by name). The documentation for `--digest` is different\n\n> This  option  is  mutually  exclusive  with  --basic,  --ntlm   and\n            --negotiate.\n\nwhich implies that it's illegal to try to set more than one (curl doesn't stop you from doing it, though).\n\nThe `--no-X` options do appear to do *something*, though. Using `--anyauth --no-digest` against a site that is configured to allow Digest auth only, for example, causes curl to not negotiate it and give up after the first request.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.14.1-DEV\n\n### operating system\n\nLinux x86_64","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
