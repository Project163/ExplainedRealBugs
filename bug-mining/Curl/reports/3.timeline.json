However, it could easily be something I have done incorrectly because I am not an expert on C style memory management.

I need to run a function like this on many windows repeatedly so this leak would get out of hand pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samtools/htslib/issues/1678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samtools/htslib/issues/1678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1738653915","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/8841#issuecomment-1738653915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/8841","id":1738653915,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5nocDb","user":{"login":"jmarshall","id":70921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall","html_url":"https://github.com/jmarshall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmarshall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-28T07:51:38Z","updated_at":"2023-09-28T07:51:38Z","body":"FYI
