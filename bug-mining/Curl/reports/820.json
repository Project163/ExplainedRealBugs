I guess it only happens when a connection is reused.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nThere should be no error.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.16.0 (aarch64-apple-darwin24.4.0) libcurl/8.16.0 OpenSSL/3.6.0 zlib/1.2.12 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.7 AppleIDN libssh2/1.11.1 nghttp2/1.67.1 ngtcp2/1.17.0 nghttp3/1.12.0 librtmp/2.3\nRelease-Date: 2025-09-10\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n\n### operating system\n\nDarwin Mac-Studio-von-Alexander.local 24.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 24.6.0: Mon Aug 11 21:16:34 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.140.69.701.11~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020 arm64\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
