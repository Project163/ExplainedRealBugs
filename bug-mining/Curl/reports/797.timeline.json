I do not think `libcurl` should be leaking memory.\n\nTo prove it, I added some `printf` calls to the `addr_ctx_unlink` function to show when it's being called and which codepaths are being taken. Here are the typical logs when everything goes well:\n\n```\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=0\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=0\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=0\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=1\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=1\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=1\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: Curl_freeaddrinfo called\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: addr_ctx is NULL\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: addr_ctx is NULL\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: addr_ctx is NULL\n```\n\nAnd here are the logs when `libcurl` leaks. It's never calling `Curl_freeaddrinfo`. Note that there is some interleaved `printf` output at the beginning of this example, suggesting concurrent calls to this function (the prints are not always interleaved in the leaking case):\n\n```\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=0\n***** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=0\n* addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=0\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=1\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=1\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=1\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: addr_ctx is NULL\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: addr_ctx is NULL\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: addr_ctx is NULL\n\n=================================================================\n==127245==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks\n\nDirect leak of 64 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:\n    #0 0x5cafcc2d171b in malloc asan_malloc_linux.cpp:67:3\n    #1 0x79a9b5b5b639 in generate_addrinfo nss/getaddrinfo.c:1081:16\n    #2 0x79a9b5b5b639 in gaih_inet nss/getaddrinfo.c:1199:12\n    #3 0x79a9b5b5b639 in getaddrinfo nss/getaddrinfo.c:2391:12\n    #4 0x5cafcc27166c in getaddrinfo sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc:2893:13\n    #5 0x5cafce6d3212 in Curl_getaddrinfo_ex lib/curl_addrinfo.c:122:11\n    #6 0x5cafce794bcf in getaddrinfo_thread lib/asyn-thrdd.c:253:10\n    #7 0x5cafce6d4d63 in curl_thread_create_thunk lib/curl_threads.c:57:3\n    #8 0x5cafcc2cf3cd in asan_thread_start(void*) asan_interceptors.cpp:239:28\n    #9 0x79a9b5a9caa3 in start_thread nptl/pthread_create.c:447:8\n\nIndirect leak of 64 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:\n    #0 0x5cafcc2d171b in malloc asan_malloc_linux.cpp:67:3\n    #1 0x79a9b5b5b639 in generate_addrinfo nss/getaddrinfo.c:1081:16\n    #2 0x79a9b5b5b639 in gaih_inet nss/getaddrinfo.c:1199:12\n    #3 0x79a9b5b5b639 in getaddrinfo nss/getaddrinfo.c:2391:12\n    #4 0x5cafcc27166c in getaddrinfo sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc:2893:13\n    #5 0x5cafce6d3212 in Curl_getaddrinfo_ex lib/curl_addrinfo.c:122:11\n    #6 0x5cafce794bcf in getaddrinfo_thread lib/asyn-thrdd.c:253:10\n    #7 0x5cafce6d4d63 in curl_thread_create_thunk lib/curl_threads.c:57:3\n    #8 0x5cafcc2cf3cd in asan_thread_start(void*) asan_interceptors.cpp:239:28\n    #9 0x79a9b5a9caa3 in start_thread nptl/pthread_create.c:447:8\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 128 byte(s) leaked in 2 allocation(s).\n```\n \n> 2. The thread being cancelled while holding the mutex lock, I do not understand. pthread cancellation is \"deferred\" by default and there is no call that could be cancelled while curl is holding the mutex. So...I fail to understand how that could happen.\n\nHere is the `printf` output that I see when it deadlocks:\n\n```\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=0\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=0\n***** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=1\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: Curl_freeaddrinfo called\n*** addr_ctx_unlink: destroy=1\n```\n\nThere seems to be some unwritten output there (`**` is the start of one of the log lines that was never finished), suggesting that maybe the resolver thread was canceled in the middle of a print while holding the mutex? Maybe the hang is caused by my addition of `printf` calls inside the mutex to track down the leak, and not an existing bug in curl? If that's the case, then you can disregard my report about the hang, but I feel this is a very subtle issue and the code right now gives you no indication that you must avoid [function calls that represent cancellation points](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html) while holding that mutex. There is a potential issue in debug builds where [this call to `assert`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-8_16_0/lib/asyn-thrdd.c#L134) might print and thus become a cancellation point, causing the hang, and in general I'd be concerned that calls might be added to curl in the future inside these critical sections unless someone really remembers that you must avoid that.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3286842089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jblazquez","id":5482684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODI2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5482684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/jblazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jblazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3288314734","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/18532#issuecomment-3288314734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18532","id":3288314734,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c7D_7Nu","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-13T12:51:02Z","updated_at":"2025-09-13T12:51:02Z","body":"@jblazquez thanks for all the analysis.
