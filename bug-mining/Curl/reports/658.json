We've mentioned it to Daniel at FOSDEM and I'm forwarding to you guys because I lack the hardware (HSM) and the knowledge to dig deeper here - and we're also near the Debian freeze for the next stable release, but we should be able to upload new version up until may.\n\nThe original report is:\n\n```\nWe have been heavily using curl to make API requests using smartcard\nauthentication. We have a private key and certificate on a Yubikey, and\nwe use curl to perform a pkcs11-authenticated login to get an API token.\n\nUnfortunately, according to the curl man page, pkcs11 support is only\navailable if curl is built against openssl.\n```\n\nAfter some back and forth with the reporter and you on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/14925), some new info come by:\n\n```\n>>>>> \"Samuel\" == Samuel Henrique <samueloph@debian.org> writes:\n    Samuel> This seems to be the biggest threat to the GnuTLS switch so\n    Samuel> far.\n\n    Samuel> In the meantime, if any of you could provide an easy\n    Samuel> reproducer, it would save us a bit of time.\n\nSo, for example with a yubikey with the PIV application configured, I\ncan log into vault using the following code on bookworm:\n    curl_args = []\n    if args.insecure: curl_args.append('-k')\n    curl_args.extend(['-E', args.pkcs11_url, '--key-type', 'eng'])\n    curl_args.extend(['--request', 'POST'])\n    if args.renew:\n        url ='v1/auth/token/renew-self'\n        curl_args.extend(['--header', f'x-vault-token: {args.renew}'])\n    else:\n        url = 'v1/auth/cert/login'\n\n    # sh has a bug where fd 0 is never considered a tty because 0 is falsy so we dup fd 0\n    result = sh.curl(*curl_args, f'{args.vault}{url}', _err=2, _in=os.dup(0))\n\n\nWhere args .pkcs11_url is initialized to\n    parser.add_argument('--pkcs11-url', '--pkcs11-uri',\n                        default = \"pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II\",\n```\n\nAnd the easy reproducer:\n\n```\nI try something like\ncurl --cert 'pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II'\nAnd I get an error:\ncurl: (3) URL rejected: Port number was not a decimal number between 0\nand 65535\n\nYet I think that's a valid pkcs11 URL.\n```\n\nI've checked the pkcs11 RFC and indeed it seems to be a valid pkcs11 URL.\n\nIt would be really nice if we could sort this one out. I'll tag also the other cURL maintainers (@samueloph and @sergiodj)\n\n\n### I expected the following\n\nUsing the HSM for pkcs11\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.8.0, 8.9.1\n\n### operating system\n\nDebian","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
