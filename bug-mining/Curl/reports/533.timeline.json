some fixes to existing PR #14579\r\n\r\n1. I was just wondering about the naming of Find* modules. It's a bit all over the place. Also CMake built-in ones are.\r\n`cmakelint` suggests full uppercase component names after `Find`. I'm fine with this, but as this `cmakelint` Issue [notes](https://github.com/cmake-lint/cmake-lint/issues/24), CMake itself [doesn't suggest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-developer.7.html#standard-variable-names) such convention and I also cannot see it confirmed \"in the wild\".\r\n\r\nI'd probably just do capital and then use whatever the component is named, and leave most existing uppercased ones as-is, changing only these:\r\n```\r\nFindLibPSL  -> FindLibpsl\r\nFindLibSSH2 -> FindLibssh2\r\nFindQUICHE  -> FindQuiche\r\nFindrustls  -> FindRustls\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither way it will need a separate PR just for that. But first what scheme should we follow here, if any?\r\n\r\n2. As for the \"weird indentation\" issues: It caught two that I was aware of (fixed now!), but the rest I'm conflicted with. `cmakelint` wants to indent multiline `if(` expression to the 2-char levels and calls it weird when aligned with the preceding `if(`. This recommendation IMO reduce readability for these expressions.\r\n\r\nFound these two solutions:\r\n- avoid multiline expressions. By unfolding or splitting to nested `if()`s. This is also weird, and may not be applicable to all expressions without reducing readability.\r\n- suppress the warning with `--filter=-whitespace/indent`. This looks harsh, but this option doesn't seem to catch real indentation issues anyway.
