Since that has been removed, there is no longer any way to tell what code is in the daily snapshot. The date itself lets you make an approximate guess, but it can't get you closer than about 7 commits (on average).\n\n### I expected the following\n\nThere should be a way to tell exactly which commit the snapshot represents to replace `CHANGES`. Some possibilities:\r\n\r\n* A file \"commit.txt\" containing the git hash. This probably isn't realistic for the official release tarballs because of the same reason log2changes was removed (the code might come from the tar ball itself, not git). But, it's reasonable to have in the daily snapshots.\r\n* A git tag for each snapshot build. While this would work, it doesn't help users who just download the tarball or don't have git and want to track the code. It will also bloat the number of tags by more than 50×.\r\n* An external mapping of snapshot date and commit number. A JSON file or API hosted on the curl.se site would make this data available to those interested, although it's not nearly as convenient as having it in the snapshot itself.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue for Test Clutch, since there is now no way to associate test results from a snapshot build to the code that generated those results.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\n8.10.0-DEV (commit 8a9c2279)\n\n### operating system\n\nOS independent","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14363/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
