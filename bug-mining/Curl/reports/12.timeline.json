Our test files hold the binary contents, so if not said otherwise the comparisons are done exactly byte by byte. For several comparisons we can mark them as `mode=\"text`\" and then the script unifies the newlines to CRLF before comparing, with the idea that they should work fine for text files on any system, including windows. Like for `<file>` comparisons.\r\n\r\nAnd again, this test works on *some* Windows builds which puzzles me. And the output @jay showed above is also weird since it seems to show two identical outputs (both using CRLF newlines) but still diff thinks they differ.
