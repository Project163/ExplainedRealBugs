that causes it to fail to parse .netrc files correctly, particularly the fallback mechanism for ~/_netrc .

This update upgrades the Ruby version to meet the minimum requirement of mixlib-log, resolving the error.\r\nHence running on ruby>= 3.1.\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n<!--- If you are suggesting a new feature or change, please create an issue first -->\r\n<!--- Please link to the issue, discourse, or stackoverflow here: -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
