In curl 7.83 they were sent as `user@host`.\r\n\r\nIf I remove the line that sets `CURLOPT_NETRC` then it works fine as well, so there seems to be an interaction between netrc and quoted credentials that has changed in either 7.84 or 7.85. Maybe one of https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9243 or https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/8908?\r\n\r\nI didn't test 7.84, only 7.83 and 7.85, because 7.84 is not available on conda-forge.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'm unable to reproduce this outside of Mamba. I tried a C API example and pycurl but in both cases quoting is correct.\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nCan reproduce on Linux and macOS.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9709/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
