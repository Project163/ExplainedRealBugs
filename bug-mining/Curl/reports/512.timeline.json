Problem description\n\nThere's a change in libcurl 8.9.1 that causes transmission-daemon to exit within 30 seconds. The cause is unhandled `SIGPIPE` and the details are already covered here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/pull/14296#issuecomment-2263711275\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/issues/14344\r\nhttps://github.com/transmission/transmission/issues/7035\r\n\r\nIt seems that currently the only way to fix it is to either downgrade libcurl or to revert this commit:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/17e6f06ea37136c36d2712b3433ef0d3b118ec0d\r\n\r\nThere is no mention yet about when to expect a proper fix upstream, so my hope is that you could roll back the Termux libcurl package to 8.9.0 until then. Transmission is literally unusable right now.\n\n### What steps will reproduce the bug?\n\nWith libcurl 8.9.1 and transmission 4.0.6, run transmission-daemon in the foreground and wait for approximately 15-30 seconds for it to exit by itself, then echo the return value.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ transmission-daemon -f; echo $?\r\n141\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see exit code 141, which is 128 + `SIGPIPE`.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nBeing able to download Linux distro images via torrent.\n\n### System information\n\n```shell\nTermux

sure if I read the code correctly... but I think that if an application has set `CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL` to 1, curl 8.9.1 (without this bugfix) will replace the application's signal handler for `SIGPIPE`, and not restore it later.\r\n\r\n`sigpipe_apply()` will call `sigpipe_restore()`, and there this is called:\r\n```\r\nsigaction(SIGPIPE, &ig->old_pipe_act, NULL);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ig` has been initialized to zeroes, so it does not contain a valid signal handler, but this test program shows that the previous signal handler gets replaced:\r\n```\r\n#include <signal.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <string.h>\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n  struct sigaction x;\r\n  memset(&x, '\\0', sizeof(x));\r\n\r\n  signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN);\r\n  sigaction(SIGPIPE, &x, NULL);\r\n\r\n  usleep(100000000);\r\n\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you send this program a `SIGPIPE`, it will quit (at least on Linux).\r\n\r\n@bagder I think that this is quite a serious regression, and it has been introduced in a curl bugfix release (8.9.1), so another bugfix release (8.9.2) is probably a good idea...","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2269306991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mkauf","id":12849992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODQ5OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12849992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf","html_url":"https://github.com/mkauf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13765841135,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c6RoN92zwAAAAM0ghDv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/13765841135","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-05T15:09:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13765841149,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c6RoN92zwAAAAM0ghD9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/13765841149","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-05T15:09:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2269363210","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/14344#issuecomment-2269363210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14344","id":2269363210,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6HQ7wK","user":{"login":"rsbeckerca","id":28956764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTU2NzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28956764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca","html_url":"https://github.com/rsbeckerca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsbeckerca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-05T15:36:15Z","updated_at":"2024-08-05T15:36:15Z","body":"@bagder
