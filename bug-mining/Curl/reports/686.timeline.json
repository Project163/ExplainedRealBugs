\n\nHi,\n\nI apologize on my behalf as I seemingly was very tired testing it.\nEnabling both ZSH and  FISH works, enabling only one causes issues.\n\nHaving another look at the scripts/CMakeLists.txt it seems like it doesn't evaluate whether either option is enabled when defining the install section? This seems to work on my end.\n\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/scripts/CMakeLists.txt#L55\n```if(CURL_COMPLETION_FISH AND NOT CURL_COMPLETION_FISH_DIR)```\n\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/scripts/CMakeLists.txt#L65\n```if(CURL_COMPLETION_ZSH AND NOT CURL_COMPLETION_ZSH_DIR)```\n\n..and another unrelated note,\n\n```include(GNUInstallDirs)``` in already accessed before scripts dir so there's no need to load it again?\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L2059\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L2080\n\nBest
