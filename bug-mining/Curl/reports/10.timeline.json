Hyper problems. I'll just add this here.\r\nA command `curl --http3 https://www.cloudflare.com`, gives:\r\n```\r\ncurl: (56) Hyper: [1] operation was canceled: connection closed before message completed\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding w/o `-DUSE_HYPER` the same command works fine. But the `.html` output says:\r\n```\r\nPlease enable cookies.\r\nSorry, you have been blocked\r\nYou are unable to access www.cloudflare.com\r\n```\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1137027355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gvanem","id":945271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NTI3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/945271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem","html_url":"https://github.com/gvanem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvanem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1137032052","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/8894#issuecomment-1137032052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/8894","id":1137032052,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5Dxbt0","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T09:49:04Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T09:49:04Z","body":"Sure, Hyper support is still experimental and \"not there yet\".
