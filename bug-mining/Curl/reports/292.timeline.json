Good find with the Windows API! The page says `LDAP_OPT_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` needs to be set as an option, and that is not being set by curl. So this feature might be possible, but needs to be implemented.\r\n\r\n[ Yesterday I did `git grep clientcert`, which has no hits in `lib/ldap.c` (the curl WinLDAP interface).

The previous version I had installed was 7.78 and it works.  7.78 calls  ldap_result in oldap_recv with LDAP_MSG_RECEIVED and subsequently loops through all messages, while later versions (not sure when it was changed) call ldap_result with LDAP_MSG_ONE, and set the result from oldap_recv to CURLE_AGAIN, indicating more stuff (the result msg) is still expected.  But nothing interprets that result so curl just sits forever unless max-time is set on the call.  There may be more than one way to fix it, but if CURLE_AGAIN is checked at the end of the do loop in readwrite_data, or if conn->cselect_bits is set to CURL_CSELECT_IN in oldap_recv after processing the ldap entry message, oldap_recv will get called again and pull in the result message.  I couldn't see how to get it working otherwise.\r\n\r\nFor 7.85 and 86, it's the same, but you now have to define export USE_OPENLDAP=1 in either CFLAGS or CPPFLAGS before running configure in order for the oldap modules in openldap.c to be executed.  It used to be the default but I think it was changed for 7.85.  The default now is for the path to go through ldap.c, and, for me, at the moment, that same curl call results in the \"bind via ldap_simple_bind_s Can't contact LDAP server\" message.  I haven't done much to trace it out, but I think it may have to do with the CA's - not sure yet.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to deploy 7.86 with USE_OPENLDAP=1 until I can get the ldap.c path working.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1363232924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wjeral","id":121254151,"node_id":"U_kgDOBzoxBw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121254151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral","html_url":"https://github.com/wjeral","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjeral/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10017924209,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAiu0c5TM7SQzwAAAAJVHWRx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/10017924209","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"26b437393e5aa383f65e375b29314482d14282f8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/26b437393e5aa383f65e375b29314482d14282f8","created_at":"2023-08-06T20:59:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10459073517,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c5TM7SQzwAAAAJvaMvt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/10459073517","actor":{"login":"ptitSeb","id":3250792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTA3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3250792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb","html_url":"https://github.com/ptitSeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptitSeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"747e5d35260d332c6a3d3adb0c32494f62a4309c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wasix-org/curl/commits/747e5d35260d332c6a3d3adb0c32494f62a4309c","created_at":"2023-09-25T08:04:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
