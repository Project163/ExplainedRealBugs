It allows\r\nrunning under Cygwin/MSYS without Windows system folders in the `PATH`.\r\n\r\nAlso: fix indentation and tidy up syntax of the `icacls` branch.\r\n\r\nNote: As of this commit, these `setfacl` and `icacls` calls are not\r\nnecessary for a successful CI run. This includes OpenSSH for Windows\r\ntests, that aren't run by default. Keep them anyway, because locally\r\nthey may be necessary depending on environment.\r\n\r\nReported-by: Brian Inglis\r\nFixes #16437\r\nRef: #16803\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nw/o ws https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/16465/files?w=1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16465/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16600359035,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c6rIw10zwAAAAPddWB7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/16600359035","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-05T14:06:10Z","label":{"name":"KNOWN_BUGS material","color":"d93f0b"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2746191620","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16437#issuecomment-2746191620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16437","id":2746191620,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6jr48E","user":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-23T12:45:16Z","updated_at":"2025-03-23T12:48:16Z","body":"I tried `setfacl` again on Windows.

Right away, its `getfacl` output was much more detailed than the forks tested earlier. `setfacls -b` also worked locally, so rebooted my previous CI attempt by just dropping `chgrp` (and any additional `setfacl`) and it seems to work as expected:\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/actions/runs/14023736699/job/39259043743?pr=16803\r\n\r\nThis, while using a _pure_ `PATH` as you mentioned, and recommended in the action's README.\r\n(edit: went a step further and excluded `System32`)\r\n\r\nWhile there, I also moved Cygwin from C: to D:, saving noticeable time in the install step (sample size: 1 at 1m30s; but the longer install times (~2-3 minutes) were consistent before this patch.)\r\n\r\nI wanted to move `C:\\cygwin-packages` to `D:` too, but that isn't supported, with an open feature request since early 2023:\r\nhttps://github.com/cygwin/cygwin-install-action/issues/7\r\nIs there a chance to add support for it as a configurable action input?
