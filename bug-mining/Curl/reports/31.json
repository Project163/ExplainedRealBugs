the file `lib/sendf.c`, the function `Curl_infof` has the following [code](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/e0c68f02552511df57f2afec2e62bc3ee684e12f/lib/sendf.c#L243):\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid Curl_infof(struct Curl_easy *data, const char *fmt, ...) {\r\n    ...\r\n    size_t len;\r\n    char buffer[MAXINFO + 2];\r\n    len = mvsnprintf(buffer, MAXINFO, fmt, ap);\r\n    buffer[len++] = '\\n';\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSince the function `mvsnprintf` may return `-1` (see the code [here](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/e0c68f02552511df57f2afec2e62bc3ee684e12f/lib/mprintf.c#L597)), the following buffer access `buffer[len++]` can trigger a buffer overrun.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the code for `Curl_failf` may trigger buffer overrun too:\r\n```\r\nvoid Curl_failf(struct Curl_easy *data, const char *fmt, ...) {\r\n    size_t len;\r\n    char error[CURL_ERROR_SIZE + 2];\r\n    len = mvsnprintf(error, CURL_ERROR_SIZE, fmt, ap);\r\n    error[len++] =
