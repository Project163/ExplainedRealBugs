You can't build the Secure Transport code with GCC, because GCC (so far as I understand) does not support Grand Central Dispatch, and both `SecTrustEvaluateAsync()` and its replacement function `SecTrustEvaluateAsyncWithError()` require Grand Central Dispatch support to be present in the compiler.\r\n\r\n@nickzman \r\nYou probably refer to blocks, which indeed are not yet supported in GCC, but those are distinct thing. There is nothing like GCD support in the compiler, AFAIK.\r\nPre-release headers of 10.6 did require blocks in `dispatch.h`, but that requirement was dropped in released versions. `libdispatch` itself builds with gcc from source.\r\n\r\nCompare, for example:\r\n10a190 header: https://github.com/barracuda156/10.6-PowerPC-SDKs/blob/1aee512fbbb7949fc33d4668eec429c73cc2b2ff/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/include/dispatch/dispatch.h#L12-L14\r\nvs 10.6.x (release) header: https://github.com/alexey-lysiuk/macos-sdk/blob/2e3a0a902a4d8e641d44224ef2860a4f1ebfd9d7/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/include/dispatch/dispatch.h (error-out macro is gone).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2029247136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"barracuda156","id":92015510,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXwLlg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92015510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156","html_url":"https://github.com/barracuda156","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barracuda156/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12307211273,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c5JpTyizwAAAALdkSQJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/12307211273","actor":{"login":"nickzman","id":52866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman","html_url":"https://github.com/nickzman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-01T06:37:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12307211282,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c5JpTyizwAAAALdkSQS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/12307211282","actor":{"login":"nickzman","id":52866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman","html_url":"https://github.com/nickzman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickzman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-01T06:37:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
