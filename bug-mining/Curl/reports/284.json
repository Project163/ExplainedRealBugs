Entering the URLs either from a config-file or set on the command-line doesn't matter.\r\nA simple `get-urls.bat` file to reproduce:\r\n```bat\r\n@echo off\r\nsetlocal\r\nset CURL_SSL_BACKEND=schannel\r\necho url=https://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/SAS4133  > %TEMP%\\curl_urls.txt\r\necho url=https://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/BBD6810 >> %TEMP%\\curl_urls.txt\r\necho url=https://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/THY19Y  >> %TEMP%\\curl_urls.txt\r\ncurl -s -K - < %TEMP%\\curl_urls.txt | grep \"_airport_codes_iata\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the above `.bat` file takes at least 1 minute to complete!
