thanks for the detailed report. Without having tried this locally, I think your analysis is correct. The timeout prevents `httpversion_seen` to be updated and the connection is left in \"limbo\". The second transfer is waiting for it to come out of that state, but it never does.\n\nI have to look at how we best fix this. I would prefer to close this connection, but that might not work very well in your setup. A 1ms timeout on the first request on a connection is very tight...\n\nUpdate: after some thinking, maybe `httpversion_seen` should be set by a successful ALPN negotiation...","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3154597166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":18988702392,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c7EPYXFzwAAAARr0Jq4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/18988702392","actor":{"login":"IoannisGS","id":8382457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODI0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8382457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS","html_url":"https://github.com/IoannisGS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-05T10:21:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18988702415,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c7EPYXFzwAAAARr0JrP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/18988702415","actor":{"login":"IoannisGS","id":8382457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODI0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8382457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS","html_url":"https://github.com/IoannisGS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-05T10:21:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3154654233","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/18177#issuecomment-3154654233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18177","id":3154654233,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c68CDQZ","user":{"login":"IoannisGS","id":8382457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODI0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8382457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS","html_url":"https://github.com/IoannisGS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IoannisGS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-05T10:37:28Z","updated_at":"2025-08-05T10:37:36Z","body":">
