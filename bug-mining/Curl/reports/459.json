Specifically, the documented method signature in the Synopsis specifies a `char *` for the first parameter, but the example code specifies a `void *` in its example callback method.  \r\n\r\nI want to use `char *` in my callback method to avoid having to cast the first parameter to `char *`.  But I cannot be sure from the documentation whether this pointer is a `char *` to begin with or not.\r\n\r\nEither the example should be changed to use `char *` for the first parameter in its callback function, or the specified method signature in the Synopsis should be changed to use `void *`, so there is consistency and clarity.\r\n\r\nThank you.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.7.1\n\n### operating system\n\nWindows 10 64-bit","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
