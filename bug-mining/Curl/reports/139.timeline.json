the last 5 years I have been building and testing new Curl releases on OS400 and usually raise and fix issues usually within a day (or two) of a release, unfortunately 7.87 dropped a couple of days after I'd already turned my work laptop off for the duration of the 2022 Christmas holidays. I missed this and I am only just picking up this new release today, I do appreciate that this issue has already been found/closed already so I can apply the patch :-)\r\n\r\nThe IBM GSKit runtime is available on many other non-IBM platforms other than OS400/AIX & z/OS, including various flavours of Linux, Windows, Mac, etc and it does provide support all modern TLS features - even if the lib/vtls/gskit.c code has not yet implemented them. \r\n\r\nI do however acknowledge that the GSKit developer kit and header files that would be necessary for _anyone_ to build with GSKit backend on other platforms are not made publicly available (only on OS400) and so that raises issues with maintaining GSKit on just the OS400 platform in this project.\r\n\r\nI will need to plan to mitigate the impact of this deprecation. Would it be a safe assumption that CURLSSLBACKEND_GSKIT will continue be defined/reserved?
