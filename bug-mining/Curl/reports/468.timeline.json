#13754\r\n\r\nI refactor canon_query, so I could use the encoding part of the function to use it in the path.\r\n\r\nAs the path doesn't encode '/', but encode '=', I had to add some conditions to know If I was doing the query or path encoding.\r\n\r\nAlso, instead of adding a `bool in_path` variable, I use `bool *found_equals` to know if the function was called for the query or path, as found_equals is used only in query_encoding.\r\n\r\nNote: When I try replacing manually `=` with `%3D`, curl without this patch worked, so they might still be a bug out-there.

Overview\r\nAs mentioned in **#419**, I was also very excited about having support for Amazon Bedrock, so I decided to work on adding it.  \r\nI also referenced **[avante_bedrock.nvim](https://github.com/yuchanns/avante_bedrock.nvim)** for parsing the response. Thank you for the great work!\r\n\r\n## Summary of Changes\r\nThis PR introduces **support for Amazon Bedrock** as a new provider and adds the necessary implementation to integrate it into Avante.nvim. The key changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n### 1. Newly Added Files\r\n- `lua/avante/providers/bedrock.lua`\r\n  - Implements the **entry point for the Bedrock provider**.\r\n  - Handles API request construction and model selection.\r\n\r\n- `lua/avante/providers/bedrock/claude.lua`\r\n  - A dedicated handler module for **Claude series** via Bedrock.\r\n  - Formats API parameters and processes responses.\r\n\r\n### 2. Modified Existing Files\r\n- `README.md`\r\n  - Added instructions for **setting up Amazon Bedrock**.\r\n  - Explained the usage of the `BEDROCK_KEYS` environment variable.\r\n\r\n- `lua/avante/config.lua`\r\n  - Added default settings for the `bedrock` provider.\r\n\r\n- `lua/avante/llm.lua`\r\n  - Extended the LLM module to **support Bedrock as a provider**.\r\n\r\n- `lua/avante/providers/init.lua`\r\n  - Registered `bedrock.lua` as a provider.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nAmazon Bedrock is a **single provider** that offers **multiple models, each with different request and response formats**.  \r\nTo accommodate this, a **new `bedrock/` directory has been introduced** within `providers/`, where each model is handled by its own dedicated module.\r\n\r\n### Future Expandability\r\n- **New model handlers can be added inside `bedrock/` to support additional models.**\r\n- For example, to support **Cohere** or **Mistral** via Bedrock, simply adding `bedrock/cohere.lua` or `bedrock/mistral.lua` will make them available.\r\n\r\n### Unified Authentication\r\n- To **maintain consistency with other providers** (such as ChatGPT and Gemini), authentication is managed via a **single environment variable (`BEDROCK_KEYS`)**.\r\n- The variable follows a simple format:  \r\n  ```sh\r\n  export BEDROCK_KEYS=aws_access_key_id,aws_secret_access_key,aws_region\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Potential Impact\r\n- A new bedrock configuration block is added to config.lua.\r\n- The providers module now includes bedrock.lua, enabling Bedrock as a supported provider.\r\n- llm.lua and init.lua have been updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\nThere is a known issue where requests to Amazon Bedrock may fail if curl is outdated.\r\nThis issue is discussed in detail in [curl/curl#13754](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/13754).\r\nIf you encounter errors when using Bedrock, please update curl to the latest version and try again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI deeply appreciate the work that has been done on this project, and I hope this contribution aligns with the project's vision.\r\nIf there are any issues or suggestions for improvement, I would greatly appreciate your feedback.\r\nThank you for your time and consideration!

For AWS S3 that requires credentials, if an object key name contains `=`, libcurl will fail with an HTTP 403 response. This problem does not occur to public S3 objects. This can be reproduced using the `curl` program:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n\r\n# version: curl 8.15.0-DEV\r\ncurl_bin=<my_curl_program_loc>\r\n\r\n# ..........S3 private..........\r\nregion=$(aws configure get region)\r\nuser_password=$(aws configure get aws_access_key_id):$(aws configure get aws_secret_access_key)\r\n# curl can handle this. The object key name does not contain =\r\nurl=\"https://<private-bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/witcher/2MiB.bin\"\r\n# curl cannot handle this. The object key name contains =\r\nurl=\"https://<private-bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/witcher/key=value_2MiB.bin\"\r\n\r\n$curl_bin -s $url \\\r\n--aws-sigv4 \"aws:amz:$region:s3\" \\\r\n--user \"$user_password\" \\\r\n-o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" -v\r\n\r\n# ..........S3 public..........\r\n# curl can handle both\r\nurl=\"https://<public-bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/witcher/2MiB.bin\"\r\nurl=\"https://<public-bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/witcher/key=value_2MiB.bin\"\r\n$curl_bin -s $url \\\r\n-o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" -v\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional problem\r\nIt has been found that beyond `=` alone, other special characters such as `!*'()` in a private S3 object will also cause libcurl error. In addition, some characters such as `+` in a public S3 object will cause the same error.\r\n\r\n## This PR\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this problem by handling special characters listed in the [AWS object key naming guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-guidelines), for both private and public S3 object names. The KvikIO-specific object key naming guidelines are added to the remote file documentation.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this PR introduces utility classes `UrlBuilder` (to complement the existing `UrlParser`), which builds a URL according to the user-provided components, and `UrlEncoder` which uses a compile-time, percent-encoding lookup table to encode selected characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/rapidsai/kvikio/issues/823","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rapidsai/kvikio/issues/844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rapidsai/kvikio/issues/844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20068349358,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c6Jz29TzwAAAASsKrWu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20068349358","actor":{"login":"rapids-bot[bot]","id":73299758,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NzMyOTk3NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/85914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/rapids-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rapids-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a5661b9e168fed1a09f28c202b6f4b8122656efd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rapidsai/kvikio/commits/a5661b9e168fed1a09f28c202b6f4b8122656efd","created_at":"2025-10-02T20:46:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
