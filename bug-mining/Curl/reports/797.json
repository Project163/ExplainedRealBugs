Intermittent `getaddrinfo` memory leak on shutdown:\n\nRunning our application with LeakSanitizer enabled, performing a single HTTP request with libcurl, and quickly exiting the application (potentially before the request completes) results in a LeakSanitizer report about 10% of the time due to a memory leak where `freeaddrinfo` is apparently never called:\n\n```\n==275324==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks\n\nDirect leak of 64 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:\n    #0 0x5a3b33c486db in malloc asan_malloc_linux.cpp:67:3\n    #1 0x73e4d375b639 in generate_addrinfo nss/getaddrinfo.c:1081:16\n    #2 0x73e4d375b639 in gaih_inet nss/getaddrinfo.c:1199:12\n    #3 0x73e4d375b639 in getaddrinfo nss/getaddrinfo.c:2391:12\n    #4 0x5a3b33be862c in getaddrinfo sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc:2893:13\n    #5 0x5a3b3604a1d2 in Curl_getaddrinfo_ex lib/curl_addrinfo.c:122:11\n    #6 0x5a3b3610bb9f in getaddrinfo_thread lib/asyn-thrdd.c:252:10\n    #7 0x5a3b3604bd23 in curl_thread_create_thunk ib/curl_threads.c:57:3\n    #8 0x5a3b33c4638d in asan_thread_start(void*) asan_interceptors.cpp:239:28\n    #9 0x73e4d369caa3 in start_thread nptl/pthread_create.c:447:8\n\nIndirect leak of 128 byte(s) in 2 object(s) allocated from:\n    #0 0x5a3b33c486db in malloc lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:67:3\n    #1 0x73e4d375b639 in generate_addrinfo nss/getaddrinfo.c:1081:16\n    #2 0x73e4d375b639 in gaih_inet nss/getaddrinfo.c:1199:12\n    #3 0x73e4d375b639 in getaddrinfo nss/getaddrinfo.c:2391:12\n    #4 0x5a3b33be862c in getaddrinfo sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc:2893:13\n    #5 0x5a3b3604a1d2 in Curl_getaddrinfo_ex lib/curl_addrinfo.c:122:11\n    #6 0x5a3b3610bb9f in getaddrinfo_thread lib/asyn-thrdd.c:252:10\n    #7 0x5a3b3604bd23 in curl_thread_create_thunk lib/curl_threads.c:57:3\n    #8 0x5a3b33c4638d in asan_thread_start(void*) lib/asan/asan_interceptors.cpp:239:28\n    #9 0x73e4d369caa3 in start_thread nptl/pthread_create.c:447:8\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 192 byte(s) leaked in 3 allocation(s).\n```\n\n2. Intermittent hang in `async_thrdd_shutdown`\n\nSimilarly, running our application many times in a loop results in a hang about 5% of the time. The hang occurs in `async_thrdd_shutdown` with the following callstack:\n\n```\n#0  futex_wait (private=0, expected=2, futex_word=0x74a0c3ae7a30) at ../sysdeps/nptl/futex-internal.h:146\n#1  __GI___lll_lock_wait (futex=futex@entry=0x74a0c3ae7a30, private=0) at ./nptl/lowlevellock.c:49\n#2  in lll_mutex_lock_optimized (mutex=0x74a0c3ae7a30) at ./nptl/pthread_mutex_lock.c:48\n#3  ___pthread_mutex_lock (mutex=mutex@entry=0x74a0c3ae7a30) at ./nptl/pthread_mutex_lock.c:93\n#4  async_thrdd_shutdown (data=data@entry=0x75d0c3af2100) at lib/asyn-thrdd.c:533\n#5  Curl_async_thrdd_shutdown (data=0x75d0c3af2100) at lib/asyn-thrdd.c:585\n#6  Curl_async_shutdown (data=0x75d0c3af2100) at lib/asyn-base.c:200\n#7  multi_done (data=0x75d0c3af2100, status=<optimized out>, premature=false) at lib/multi.c:654\n#8  multi_runsingle (multi=<optimized out>, nowp=<optimized out>, data=0x75d0c3af2100) at lib/multi.c:2596\n#9  curl_multi_perform (m=<optimized out>, running_handles=<optimized out>) at lib/multi.c:2771\n```\n\nThe hanging line is trying to acquire the mutex [here](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-8_16_0/lib/asyn-thrdd.c#L526).\n\nLooking at the contents of the `addr_ctx->mutx` variable, they look like this:\n\n```\n$2 = {__data = {__lock = 2, __count = 0, __owner = 263166, __nusers = 1, __kind = 0, __spins = 0, __elision = 0, __list = {__prev = 0x0, __next = 0x0}}, __size = \"\\002\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\000\\376\\003\\004\\000\\001\", '\\000' <repeats 26 times>, __align = 2}\n```\n\nIn particular, `__lock = 2` which I believe means the mutex is currently locked, and `__owner` is TID 263166 which - at the time of the hang - does not refer to any running thread. I assume that TID refers to the no-longer-running async resolver thread.\n\nWhat I think might have happened is that [`pthread_cancel`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-8_16_0/lib/asyn-thrdd.c#L538C11-L538C29) was called on the resolver thread while the thread had the mutex locked and before it had a chance to unlock it, which of course is catastrophic. This might also explain the intermittent `getaddrinfo` memory leak.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nThe async resolver does not leak or hang.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.16.0\n\n### operating system\n\nUbuntu Linux 24.04","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18532/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
