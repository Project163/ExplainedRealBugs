And then checking `/usr/include/stdio.h` we find this:\n```\n#ifdef _LARGE_FILES\n#define fseeko fseeko64\n#define ftello ftello64\n#define fgetpos fgetpos64\n#define fsetpos fsetpos64\n#define fopen fopen64\n#define freopen freopen64\n#endif /* _LARGE_FILES */\n```\n\nSo when doing 32 bit build, `fopen` becomes a `#define`.\n\nAnd now we get back to same problem as yesterday. `stdio.h` is included from `curl_setup.h`. At the end of `curl_setup.h` we include `curl_mem_undef.h`. And here we do `#undef fopen`.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI expect a clean build.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.16.0 tag\n\n### operating system\n\nAIX 7.2.5\nOnly when building in 32 bit mode","closed_by":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18510/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
