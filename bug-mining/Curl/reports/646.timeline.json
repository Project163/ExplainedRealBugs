The problem is: there is no CR or LF or CRLF on the wire (I've checked with Wireshark), but `^M` is present in `curl`'s output. Moreover, `curl` prints CR for empty strings (`> ` in the end of the header block). And CR is present in request headers, which are generated by `curl` (again, it is in the command output, but not on the wire).\n\nSo, I believe [#99903b5](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/99903b57188fe734435da43332ac250e6a7c1015) is very confusing and even misleading. While it is technically true (`curl` does show the exact content), users might believe that their `^M` are always from a server. As I see from Wireshark captures, in my case `^M`s are pure representation things generated by `curl` itself.\n\nMaybe my original description was not clear enough, I'm sorry if so. `CR` is present before `LF` at the end of each and every header line, both for request and response headers. Both client and server are Linux boxes. There is no `CR` in network packets—so `CR` is printing (representation) \"feature\" of `--verbose`, not a real byte from network.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2647803168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andrei-korshikov","id":15959858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU5ODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15959858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov","html_url":"https://github.com/andrei-korshikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2647836023","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16285#issuecomment-2647836023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16285","id":2647836023,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6d0sV3","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-10T12:24:00Z","updated_at":"2025-02-10T12:24:00Z","body":"> Hmm.

When curl speaks HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 it converts and shows the headers to look the same: then the CRLF pair is actually put there by curl itself. But the purpose is then to make them look like they do when HTTP/1.x is used. I'm not sure we need to elaborate on this exact process in the documentation.\n\n> Moreover, curl prints CR for empty strings (> in the end of the header block).\n\nLike for received that's because the protocol includes CRLF.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2647836023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2647852106","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16285#issuecomment-2647852106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16285","id":2647852106,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6d0wRK","user":{"login":"andrei-korshikov","id":15959858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU5ODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15959858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov","html_url":"https://github.com/andrei-korshikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-korshikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-10T12:31:13Z","updated_at":"2025-02-10T12:31:13Z","body":"> But the purpose is then to make them look like they do when HTTP/1.x is used.\n\nAha!
