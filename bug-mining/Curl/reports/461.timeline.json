By googling the error message, I realized that `curl` (and `httr`), `BiocFileCache` dependencies, now use http version 2 instead of 1.1. See https://github.com/jeroen/curl/issues/232 for a related issue. There they link to https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/curl/vignettes/intro.html#Disabling_HTTP2 for disabling HTTP2, but I'm not sure if I can do that as a `BiocFileCache` user. Maybe through the `config` argument https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ABioconductor%2FBiocFileCache%20config&type=code. But that doesn't seem to be the case (maybe I'm not specifying `config` where I should):\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> BiocFileCache::bfcrpath(bfc, \"http://www.dropbox.com/s/srkb2ife75px2yz/modeling_results_BayesSpace_k09.Rdata?dl=1\", config = list(http_version = 2))\r\nadding rname 'http://www.dropbox.com/s/srkb2ife75px2yz/modeling_results_BayesSpace_k09.Rdata?dl=1'\r\n  |==================================================================================| 100%\r\n\r\nError in BiocFileCache::bfcrpath(bfc, \"http://www.dropbox.com/s/srkb2ife75px2yz/modeling_results_BayesSpace_k09.Rdata?dl=1\",  : \r\n  not all 'rnames' found or unique.\r\nIn addition: Warning message:\r\nIn value[[3L]](cond) : \r\ntrying to add rname 'http://www.dropbox.com/s/srkb2ife75px2yz/modeling_results_BayesSpace_k09.Rdata?dl=1' produced error:\r\n  HTTP/2 stream 1 was not closed cleanly: PROTOCOL_ERROR (err 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I find weird is that the download does actually happen, but at the very end it errors out. So I'm not 100% sure that the error is related to the http version 1.1 vs 2 change.\r\n\r\nHm... maybe something else changed in `BiocFileCache::bfcrpath()` that I'm not aware of, but well, in that case, I would expect things to break on GitHub Actions and BBS as well.\r\n\r\n1 to 3 students at https://github.com/lcolladotor/cshl_rstats_genome_scale_2023 ran into this error and I thought it was something related their laptop configurations, and for the purpose of that course, we could get around things by having them download the data from Dropbox manually.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLeo\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Bioconductor/BiocFileCache/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Bioconductor/BiocFileCache/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"lcolladotor","id":2288213,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODgyMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2288213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor","html_url":"https://github.com/lcolladotor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcolladotor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-20T19:39:10Z","updated_at":"2024-05-20T19:39:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeroen/curl/issues/338","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeroen/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeroen/curl/issues/338/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeroen/curl/issues/338/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeroen/curl/issues/338/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jeroen/curl/issues/338","id":2301546456,"node_id":"I_kwDOAZV7yc6JLs_Y","number":338,"title":"curl

I can use it to download some of the datasets. But for most of the dataset, the above error occurred.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  proj_info <- subset(\r\n    projects,\r\n    project == SRA_Accession & project_type == \"data_sources\"\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  rse_gene <- create_rse(proj_info[1,])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wonder if it is an internet connection problem. Can I manage to solve it? Any response would be much
