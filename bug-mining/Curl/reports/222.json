In the old algorithm, when resolving `~`,  symbol `/` was automatically added after the home directory in the resulting path, which allowed the request to work. But, for example, the next request didn't work:\r\n```\r\n$ curl -u builder 'sftp://192.168.236.1/home/builder'\r\nEnter host password for user 'builder':\r\ncurl: (56) Failure when receiving data from the peer\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure yet whether the function _Curl_getworkingpath()_ should resolve the path `/~` to `/home/user` or to `/home/user/ `, as it was before.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11001/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
