Make server return response without waiting for request data, which may trigger STOP_SENDING from server.  ngtcp2 server --early-response does this.\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\ncurl stops with some indication of error.\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\n[curl -V output]\r\ncurl 7.85.0-DEV\r\nmaster branch\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\n<!-- On Unix please post the output of \"uname -a\" -->\r\nlinux\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
