It's been a while since I last did raw sockets, but if my memory serves me right you are supposed to invoke `shutdown()` on the socket to signal to the kernel that you want to close the connection. This will cause the kernel to send a `FIN` packet to the remote host which in turn flushes its buffers and sends a `FIN` as well. `close` immediately closes the socket and if the kernel does this closing dance its more a happy coincidence than guaranteed. You can read more about that [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23483487/7992576).\r\n\r\nHowever in most cases the unclean shutdown isn't really an issue cause if you close the socket you probably dont care about data in the remotes buffers anyway. The bigger issue is that you can't tell libcurl to immediately close the connection without resorting to ugly hacks. In the ideal case multi would behave the same as easy except async.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1221182816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Thalhammer","id":7987999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODc5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7987999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer","html_url":"https://github.com/Thalhammer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thalhammer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1221420406","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9335#issuecomment-1221420406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9335","id":1221420406,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5IzWV2","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-20T22:40:13Z","updated_at":"2022-08-20T22:40:13Z","body":"Thanks

The connection cache is held in the multi handle.\r\n\r\nWhen `curl_easy_cleanup()` is then called, it has no connection to close. It doesn't even know in which multi handle it was once added because it is blanked (and in fact the multi handle could be gone completely). The cleanup function cannot close the connection.\r\n\r\nThe fix is probably to make `curl_multi_remove_handle()` close the connection if `CONNECT_ONLY` was set, as there is no way to reach/use that connection again after the function is called.\r\n\r\nPR
