it means also `*_LIBRARIES` and `*_LIBRARY_DIRS` are populated. These are used by curl's CMake, though never the static ones.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to say on what conditions shall a project pick up the `*_STATIC*` variants of these variables instead of the default ones. Or, ideally, is there a built-in CMake option to control this behavior? to avoid reinventing the wheel in a project-specific, and perhaps wrong way.\r\n\r\nThe general question is: how to select static vs. shared libs for specific targets and their specific dependencies. Since this would be too fiddly for most practical use-case: What options to offer that satisfy most static vs shared use-cases? (that also works smoothly across the supported build-cases)\r\n\r\nTill these questions get answers, I suggest feeding the build with the necessary libs and paths manually: `LIBIDN2_LIBRARY`/`LIBIDN_INCLUDE_DIR`, and/or `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`/`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS`/`CMAKE_C_FLAGS`.\r\n\r\nAs @bagder mentioned, static builds are generally a pain, and especially to automate them across all build

Before going there we will need to gather feedback and experience for the current ones.\r\n\r\nThe next question is how well would such option work across all dependencies when using their `_STATIC` values? Some fallouts may need individual tweaks or per-dependency control, and some people might want to control which specific dependency to stay with dynamic linking just out of preference.\r\n\r\nBeing `pkg-config`-specific still makes this feature a little odd and accidental.
