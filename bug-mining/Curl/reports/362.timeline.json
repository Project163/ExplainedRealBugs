and that did not fix my problem.\n- [X] I searched for recent similar issues at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue and found no duplicates.\n\n### What were you trying to do (and why)?\n\nUpstream bug with reproducer is here https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/25522\r\n\r\nI was trying to use cmake to download some files, and when trying to file(DOWNLOAD) the same file twice from cmake the second try fails with \"SSL connect error\". This appears to have started with macOS 14.2's update to /usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib.\r\n\r\nUse the following reproducer `download.cmake`\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)\r\n\r\nmessage(STATUS \"TRY 1\")\r\nfile(DOWNLOAD \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpp-pm/hunter-cache/master/8fd7dea/GTest/1.14.0/2b28c2a/297e0ef/4830b34/e5fa44f/basic-deps.DONE\" \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/basic-deps.DONE\" TLS_VERIFY ON STATUS status LOG log)\r\nmessage(\"STATUS: ${status}\")\r\nmessage(\"LOG: ${log}\")\r\n\r\n\r\nmessage(STATUS \"TRY 2\")\r\nfile(DOWNLOAD \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpp-pm/hunter-cache/master/8fd7dea/GTest/1.14.0/2b28c2a/297e0ef/4830b34/e5fa44f/basic-deps.DONE\" \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/basic-deps.DONE.2\" TLS_VERIFY ON STATUS status LOG log)\r\nmessage(\"STATUS: ${status}\")\r\nmessage(\"LOG: ${log}\")\r\n```\n\n### What happened (include all command output)?\n\nRun the reproducer with `cmake -P download.cmake`\r\n\r\n```\r\nSTATUS: 35;\"SSL connect error\"\r\nLOG:   Trying 185.199.111.133:443...\r\nConnected to raw.githubusercontent.com (185.199.111.133) port 443\r\nALPN: curl offers h2,http/1.1\r\n(304) (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):\r\n[330 bytes data]\r\n CAfile: /etc/ssl/cert.pem\r\n CApath: none\r\n(304) (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):\r\n[122 bytes data]\r\n(304) (IN), TLS handshake, Unknown (8):\r\n[19 bytes data]\r\n(304) (IN), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):\r\n[3050 bytes data]\r\nLibreSSL/3.3.6: error:0DFFF0A1:lib(13):func(4095):reason(161)\r\nClosing connection\r\n```\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\ncmake to function as it does with it's own copy of cmake (i.e. when build from source outside of brew).

I did this\r\n\r\nIn our project, we designed the curl lib to be loaded using `curl_global_init` where it can be deinit by calling `curl_global_cleanup`. If later we still need to use curl in the same process, we will call `curl_global_init` again. This \"calling `curl_global_init` after `curl_global_cleanup`\" would cause an error when I try to use the easy handle since the second call on macOS. Here is a sample code to reproduce the problem:\r\n```\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <fstream>\r\n#include <curl/curl.h>\r\n#include <chrono>\r\n#include <thread>\r\n\r\nsize_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, std::ofstream* stream) {\r\n    stream->write((char*) ptr, size * nmemb);\r\n    return size * nmemb;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid download(std::string const& filename) {\r\n    curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_ALL);\r\n    std::string url =\r\n        \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/y-scope/clp/main/components/core/\"\r\n        \"tests/test_network_reader_src/random.log\";\r\n    std::ofstream file;\r\n    CURLcode res;\r\n    CURL* curl = curl_easy_init();\r\n    file.open(filename, std::ios::binary);\r\n    if (!file.is_open()) {\r\n        std::cerr << \"Cannot open file for writing\" << std::endl;\r\n        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);\r\n        curl_global_cleanup();\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url.c_str());\r\n    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data);\r\n    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &file);\r\n    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);\r\n\r\n    if (res != CURLE_OK) {\r\n        std::cerr << \"curl_easy_perform() failed: \" << curl_easy_strerror(res) << std::endl;\r\n        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);\r\n        curl_global_cleanup();\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);\r\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(3));\r\n    curl_global_cleanup();\r\n\r\n    file.close();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    download(\"file1.log\");\r\n    download(\"file2.log\");\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`download` is called twice, each call will call `curl_global_init` and `curl_global_deinit`.

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nIt seems even after ref counting of Init/Shutdown has been added in https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/issues/2411, doing a sequence of Init/Shutdown twice, fails.\r\n\r\nIn pseudocode:\r\n```\r\nInit\r\nDo S3Get\r\nShutdown\r\n\r\nInit\r\nDo S3Get  // Fails with curlCode: 35, SSL connect error\r\nShutdown\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt seems the SDK requires us to ensure, once Shutdown is called, we can never Init again? \r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nThe outcome of S3 GET API is: `curlCode: 35, SSL connect error`\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nHere's a GTest:\r\n```\r\nTEST_F(S3Test, awsdk){    \r\n    Aws::SDKOptions options;\r\n    Aws::InitAPI(options);\r\n    Aws::S3::S3ClientConfiguration config;\r\n    auto client = std::make_unique<Aws::S3::S3Client>(config);\r\n\r\n    // GET\r\n    auto get = [&](){\r\n        Aws::S3::Model::GetObjectRequest request;\r\n        request.SetBucket(\"my-bucket\");\r\n        request.SetKey(\"my-key\");\r\n\r\n        auto outcome = client->GetObject(request);\r\n        if(!outcome.IsSuccess()){\r\n            std::cout << \"GET FAILED \" << outcome.GetError().GetMessage() << std::endl;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    get(); // THIS SUCCEEDS\r\n    client.reset();\r\n    Aws::ShutdownAPI(options);\r\n\r\n    Aws::InitAPI(options);\r\n    client = std::make_unique<Aws::S3::S3Client>(config);\r\n    get(); // THIS FAILS\r\n    client.reset();\r\n    Aws::ShutdownAPI(options);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe relevant output is:\r\n GET FAILED curlCode: 35, SSL connect error\r\n\r\nThe entire output is:\r\n```\r\n./fusion_gtest --gtest_filter=\"*S3Test*sdk*\"\r\nNote: Google Test filter =
