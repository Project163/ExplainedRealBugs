Now that some connections are in a magical shutdown phase and they do not count in the limit, we have to do some of the following options:\r\n\r\n1. block libcurl by opening more sockets (in CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION returning CURL_SOCKET_BAD when limit of 8 is reached)\r\n2. reserve more IO event handler, like 12 and hope that the extra 4 will be enough for connections which remain a bit in the new shutdown phase\r\n3. in CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION return with -1 and throw all the curl easy handlers in the wastebin (not a huge deal)\r\n\r\nI don't know if you could follow my thought or not, never mind.\r\nTo me it is strange, that those shutting down connections do not count into the limit.\r\nWould be nice to have yet another option to limit the number of those shutting down connections :D\r\nIf you consider that this behaviour is fine by curl, feel free to close this ticket.\r\nThank you for your support!\r\n\r\nPS: about the logs:\r\nI know that the log is huge, but I suppose it is enough to check the last ~100 lines starting with line 9901 (containing timestamp: 1735457800.736091). At that point, only connection no. 109 was idle, but it was too old, therefore it started to be closed (but socket was not yet closed).
