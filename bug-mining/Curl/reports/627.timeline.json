Users should avoid fdset if they can because of all the issues. However the functions should be consistent aside from the limits that fdset presents.\n\nI have included the relevant code below.\nBoth versions loop through the `multi->process` list and add all of the fds from that list. However if you look at the implementation for `curl_multi_waitfds`, it also adds the fd from `multi->cpool`. So the two implementations return a different list of fds if `multi->cpool` is a valid fd.\n\nRelevant code for `curl_multi_fdset`:\n\n```\n    for(i = 0; i < data->last_poll.num; i++) {\n      if(!FDSET_SOCK(data->last_poll.sockets[i]))\n        /* pretend it does not exist */\n        continue;\n#if defined(__DJGPP__)\n#pragma GCC diagnostic push\n#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Warith-conversion\"\n#endif\n      if(data->last_poll.actions[i] & CURL_POLL_IN)\n        FD_SET(data->last_poll.sockets[i], read_fd_set);\n      if(data->last_poll.actions[i] & CURL_POLL_OUT)\n        FD_SET(data->last_poll.sockets[i], write_fd_set);\n#if defined(__DJGPP__)\n#pragma GCC diagnostic pop\n#endif\n      if((int)data->last_poll.sockets[i] > this_max_fd)\n        this_max_fd = (int)data->last_poll.sockets[i];\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nRelevant code for `curl_multi_waitfds`:\n\n```\n  Curl_waitfds_init(&cwfds, ufds, size);\n  for(e = Curl_llist_head(&multi->process); e; e = Curl_node_next(e)) {\n    struct Curl_easy *data = Curl_node_elem(e);\n    multi_getsock(data, &data->last_poll);\n    need += Curl_waitfds_add_ps(&cwfds, &data->last_poll);\n  }\n\n  need += Curl_cpool_add_waitfds(&multi->cpool,
