The idea of the API to send and receive JSON messages (transferred with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding). Everything functions properly until the connection with `etcd` is unexpectedly lost. The `libcurl` does not perform/finishes a request with an error until I actually send some data.\r\n\r\nThe reproducer:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n#include <curl/curl.h>\r\n\r\nsize_t read_callback(char *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userdata) {\r\n\t/* Just ensure that it works:\r\n\t * static int i = 0;\r\n\t * printf(\"read_callback %d\\n\", i++);\r\n\t*/\r\n\r\n\t/*\r\n\t *  You could uncomment the line to ensure that a data transfer helps to perform\r\n\t *  a request after a connection lost.\r\n\t */\r\n\t/* if (0) */\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE;\r\n\t}\r\n\tptr[0] = '\\n';\r\n\treturn 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint progress_callback(void *clientp,\r\n                      double dltotal,\r\n                      double dlnow,\r\n                      double ultotal,\r\n                      double ulnow) {\r\n\t/*\r\n\t * Ensure that the continue does not actually help without a\r\n\t * data transfer.\r\n\t */\r\n\tCURL *curl = (CURL*) clientp;\r\n\tcurl_easy_pause(curl, CURLPAUSE_CONT);\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n\tCURL *curl = curl_easy_init();\r\n\tif(curl) {\r\n  \t\t/* We want to use our own read function. */\r\n  \t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_READFUNCTION, read_callback);\r\n\r\n\t\t/* It will help us to continue the read function. */\r\n\t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION, progress_callback);\r\n\t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_XFERINFODATA, curl);\r\n\t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS, 0L);\r\n\r\n\t\t/* It will help us to ensure that keepalive does not help. */\r\n\t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE, 1L);\r\n\t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE, 1L);\r\n\t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL, 1L);\r\n\r\n  \t\t/* Enable uploading. */\r\n\t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, \"POST\");\r\n  \t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L);\r\n \r\n  \t\tcurl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, \"http://localhost:2379/v3/watch\");\r\n\t\tcurl_easy_perform(curl);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. [Download](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.9) etcd server.\r\n2. Extract it and run: `./etcd`\r\n3. Save the reproducer as `test.c`\r\n4. Compile and run the reproducer: `gcc test.c -lcurl && ./a.out`\r\n5. Close etcd server: `kill -SIGKILL $(pidof etcd)`\r\n6. See that the reproducer hangs.\r\n\r\nI would happily to use an another server to reproduce the error instead of `etcd` if you help me choose a relevant software..\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\nI expected that the request finishes (with an error) due to a lost connection.
