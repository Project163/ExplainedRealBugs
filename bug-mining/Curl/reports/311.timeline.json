Those three Appveyor jobs have been permafailing on 2600 since #11690 (commit 8627416), and, ironically, it looks to me like the whole reason for special-casing `USE_ALARM_TIMEOUT` was removed in that same commit. That commit increased the minimum `CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS` used in the test well beyond the 1 second threshold that the alarm timeouts can handle. Since that's the only thing that is handled differently in `USE_ALARM_TIMEOUT` mode, it's no longer required. Even Solaris 11 works when removing that special case.\r\n\r\nI'm going to clean it up into a PR and see how that
