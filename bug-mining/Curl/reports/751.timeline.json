I'm not seeing this error on (slightly) older versions of gcc and clang but I can see how it might happen in this case, because `Curl_ssl_scache_create()` turns into a constant when SSL is disabled.\n```C\n  if(Curl_ssl_scache_create(sesssize, 2, &multi->ssl_scache))\n    goto error;\n```\n I'm not sure what the cleanest solution is, though. Disabling the whole call in an `#ifdef` block is ugly and is what the macro is already accomplishing. Disabling the compiler warning might hide legitimate issues in the code elsewhere. Is there a `#pragma` or `attribute` that could be added to the macro to silence this?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3010624804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-27T07:10:05Z","updated_at":"2025-06-27T07:10:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17760","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17760/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17760/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17760/events","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/17760","id":3181646364,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAiu0c6cXWqX","number":17760,"title":"lib:
