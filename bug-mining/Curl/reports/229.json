However, it seems that if _no_ `Accept-Encoding` is passed, then a default of `\"deflate, gzip, br, zstd\"` will be set.\r\n\r\nOn a second read, with this knowledge in mind, it seems more clear that the header will be added if missing, but not modified if present. Maybe there is a rewording of this paragraph that better indicates the behavior? My suggestion:\r\n\r\n> (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms curl supports, and automatically decompress the content. Existing headers are not modified, but required headers (like Accept-Encoding) will be added if missing.\r\n\r\nSomeone who is more familiar with the feature could probably explain it better 😅 ","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11091/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11091/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
