I did this\n\nUploading files to an ftp server fails with version 7.87.0 and above:\r\n```curl -vvv --ftp-pasv --user <redacted> --upload-file /usr/bin/tar  ftps://<redacted>/```\r\n\r\nThe error is intermittent - around 80% of the time.\r\n\r\nWhen it fails, there is no immediate curl error, but no byte arrives on the target ftp server after a successful passive handshake (over TLSv1.2 - handshake verified using a tcpdump and wireshark dissection with TLS decryption, and payload seems to be sent over the wire), the upload seems to starts but stalls, until it finally times out (server connection reset).\r\n\r\nIt works perfectly with curl 7.86.0, and fails with curl 7.87.0 and above.\r\nThe openssl version seems irrelevant here, tested with openssl 1.1.1t and 3.0.11, only the curl version seems to be the turning point.\r\n\r\nIt looks like something changed in version 7.87.0 that makes a couple of ftp servers to choke...\r\n\r\nIt might be somehow related to #12253 which deals with an ftp-related action that started to fail with this exact same version.\r\n\r\nComparing the two failure and success outputs below makes me thing that the server is sensitive to the order in which commands arrive to properly handle the data over the secondary passive connection (race condition between those two streams).\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask for more data, including building with specific flags to troubleshoot (I can't provide the pcap file, though).\r\n\r\nFailure output:\r\n```\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n
