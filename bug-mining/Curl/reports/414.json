(Verify with a hex editor, if needed; note that opening this file in many IDEs will automatically convert it to CRLF or LF format).\r\n\r\nPOST the file to an HTTP echo debugging service, e.g.:\r\n\r\n`curl -X POST https://echo.free.beeceptor.com --header \"Content-Type: application/xml\" --data @xml-with-cr-endings.txt`\r\n\r\nObserve that when using `--data` the `rawBody` returned by the echo service is not the complete file. This is not down to the echo service; you can verify using a different one (e.g. Postman), or using a local API mocker.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, when using:\r\n\r\n`curl -X POST https://echo.free.beeceptor.com --header \"Content-Type: application/xml\" --data-binary @xml-with-cr-endings.txt`\r\n\r\nThe `rawBody` returned by the echo service is the complete file.\r\n\r\n[xml-with-cr-endings.txt](https://github.com/curl/curl/files/14510290/xml-with-cr-endings.txt)\r\n\n\n### I expected the following\n\nSince `CR` is a valid line ending for text files, I would expect the whole file to be uploaded when using the `--data`  flag; I should not have to use the `--data-binary` flag.\r\n\r\n(`CR` is the line ending that used to be used on Mac OS, before the switch to a Unix-based platform. It is still used in many industrial / health / elecontrics applications. Such line endings are valid in the XML standard, although the standard stipulates that the XML parser should normalise line endings: https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-line-ends).\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.5.0 (x86_64-conda-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.5.0 OpenSSL/3.2.1 zlib/1.2.13 zstd/1.5.5 libssh2/1.11.0 nghttp2/1.58.0\r\n\r\nI also experienced the problem using `curl 7.81`, which is the version of `curl` currently available in the `apt` package manager for Ubuntu 22.\n\n### operating system\n\nLinux 6.5.0-21-generic #21~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Feb  9 13:32:52 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
