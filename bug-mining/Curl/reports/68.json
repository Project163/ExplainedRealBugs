if it _was_ supported, then for regular non-`--location --head` invocation I'd expect it should (in the first case) **decode** the base64 payload and then **save** resulting (text) content into **file**.

This kind of redirect (as well as any kind of indirect navigation to DataURI documents) is nowadays blocked in web browsers altogether (or at least in top-level frames) for security reasons — sadly, DataURIs were  reportedly heavily abused for scams — but in the past versions this particular HTML doodle \"stored\" in the TinyURL redirect worked: it loaded HTML \"quine\" document with text editor that could save itself back into DataURI.  As of today it kinda works when loaded into sub-frame and only in Firefox, like:\r\n\r\n    data:text/html,<iframe src=\"http://tinyurl.com/selfcontained-editable-datauri\" style=\"width:80vw;height:99vh\"></iframe>","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
