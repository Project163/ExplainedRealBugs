The problem has started to appear with OpenSSL 3.2.0 and is also present with OpenSSL 3.5.0.\n\n_Generally_ if libcurl can successfully read all the content from a transfer then that transfer should not return an error even if there's a problem with the connection like bad server close. However, _if there's no known termination point_ for the transfer (like no known content length, no chunked ending, no data stream end, etc) then libcurl just keeps reading. It may or may not need a close notify, which effectively becomes the termination point. It depends on the backend. We had (or have) compatibility stuff especially for OpenSSL but then when OpenSSL made plans to increase the strictness in OpenSSL 3 we (or maybe just I) decided to leave it alone. There's a thread on this but I can't find it so my recollection may be a little off.\n\n> there should be a way to ignore the error, e.g. with the OpenSSL flag `SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF`\n\nI think that flag should work and can't think of why it doesn't. Maybe libcurl is now more strict about connection closures, apart from SSL backend.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2917827636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2918799976","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/17471#issuecomment-2918799976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17471","id":2918799976,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6t-Vpo","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-29T09:12:48Z","updated_at":"2025-05-29T09:12:48Z","body":"Agree with @jay here.

The PR https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/17526 works correctly :-) After applying it, the behavior with OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.5 is the same:\n```\ncurl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: OpenSSL/3.0.17: error:0A000126:SSL routines::unexpected eof while reading, errno 0\n```\n\nFor users of OpenSSL 3.0, the PR introduces a behavior change. I think that we have multiple options:\n* decide that curl should not ignore the unexpected EOF. Remove the special \"debug build\" behavior because that does not work anymore. [Update: The special \"debug build\" behavior still does work with OpenSSL 1.1.1]\n* decide that curl should ignore the unexpected EOF and set the flag `SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF`\n* add a flag to `CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS` to control the behavior, maybe also for the command line tool\n\nI would choose the first option because that seems to be best practice.
