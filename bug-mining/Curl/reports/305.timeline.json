@piru ,\r\n\r\nI'm the researcher behind this CVE. I've read attentively your post and have some comments on this.\r\n\r\n> I argue that https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xc3w-ghxg-pw5f really wasn't a vulnerability. User of curl / libcurl must not hold any critical files in a directory that can be tampered by third-parties.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a great advice for users, however I don't believe this to be invalidating CVE-2023-32001. For the same reason a reflected XSS vulnerability should be fixed instead of just telling users \"They shouldn't be clicking on untrusted links\".\r\n\r\n> The argument behind the https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xc3w-ghxg-pw5f fix is that there is a race condition whereas the attacker can just switch the object type to allow overwriting files with the content that is being written with the function. However, for this to be a problem the attacker must be able to modify the directory to begin with.\r\n\r\nIndeed, as marked in the advisory an attacker must have write access to the directory in which curl will store the file. As you point it out, it's not a problem in other cases thankfully otherwise the severity of this would be way higher. \r\n\r\n> First, the \"security fix\" only prevents access to regular files. You can still make the victim write to non-regular files, such as devices or pipes. This can be used to denial of service by writing over the beginning of a disk label (/dev/sdx etc) when curl is executed as appropriately privileged user.\r\n\r\nI have discussed this point explicitly with the curl team and was intended behavior from my understanding. However feel free to report this to the developers if you believe it to be a vulnerability with DoS implication.\r\n\r\n> Second, this \"security fix\" only prevents writing to already existing files. You can write to non-existing files just fine. Let's assume a naive PHP web application running on a server which the attacker also has local low-privileged access to. Let's assume the web application executes as www-data user and has write access to the location where the php files are hosted. Let's also imagine a functionality whereas curl will fetch some content while holding cookies in some insecure location where the attacker can modify the directory (write access to the directory). Say, let the PHP application use /opt/sillyapptmp/cookies.txt to hold the cookies while using curl (/opt/sillyapptmp is writable for the attacker user, as described).\r\nAttacker can now execute arbitrary shell commands as www-data by invoking https:///targetapp/shell.php?cmd=shellcommandhere\r\nThis works perfectly fine regardless of the supposed https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xc3w-ghxg-pw5f fix, if the original premise of the \"writable target directory\" holds.\r\n\r\nI was not able to reproduce this behavior on curl versions patched for this CVE.\r\n```\r\nselmelc@deb:~/tests$ ln -s b a\r\nselmelc@deb:~/tests$ ls -l\r\ntotal 0\r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 selmelc selmelc 1 Aug 21 14:17 a -> b\r\nselmelc@deb:~/tests$ curl --cookie-jar a google.com\r\n<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html;charset=utf-8\">\r\n<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>\r\n<H1>301 Moved</H1>\r\nThe document has moved\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.google.com/\">here</A>.\r\n</BODY></HTML>\r\nselmelc@deb:~/tests$ ls -l \r\ntotal 4\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 selmelc selmelc 131 Aug 21 14:18 a\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 selmelc selmelc   0 Aug 21 14:18 b\r\n```\r\nIf you're indeed able to make curl send the cookies to the file b here instead of overwriting the symbolic link please send a PoC of just that single step. As that would mean the fix implemented needs refining indeed.\r\nBut as it is, I believe you included wrong theoretical behavior to your scenario which is not how curl treats symbolic in this functionality.\r\n\r\n> This attack (and CVE-2023-32001) only works if curl is used in a way that the files written by Curl_fopen are held in an insecure directory. This is a configuration mistake, not a vulnerability in curl. I thereby argue that CVE-2023-32001 really wasn't a vulnerability to begin with.\r\nNow, accidents like this can still happen due to misconfiguration. It is however very hard to prevent exploiting them from a curl library perspective. It can be debated if this should even be attempted.\r\n\r\nI disagree with this, as clearly this is a basic TOCTOU vulnerability in curl's source code. I agree however that following best practices will mitigate it. But why would we not make software more secure if we can, especially when it's at the cost of such a negligible performance lost ? \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you disagree with any technical point here, or can prove exploitablity of this vulnerability as I am willing to retest it instantly. \r\n\r\nHave a nice day
