However, it ignores that and tries to directly connect to the proxy server's IP address.\r\n\r\nIf I remove `--connect-to` and replace my proxy IP address in `--proxy` with \"127.0.0.1:8080\" it complains about the SNI mismatch in my TLS certificate and drops the connection. It will work if I also add `--proxy-insecure`\r\n\r\nI want to get it to work without `--proxy-insecure`. I guess adding a new option like `--proxy-sni` to explicitly set the SNI for the proxy server would work for my use case too.\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\ncurl 7.81.0 (also tested with the current master branch build)\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nPop!_OS 22.04 LTS","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
