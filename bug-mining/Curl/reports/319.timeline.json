Changing this option to also enforce a hard limit would be an acceptable solution.\r\n\r\nFor Unix systems, `head -c` mostly works. Although because it was [only recently added to POSIX](https://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=407), not all Unix systems have this yet, for example, [OpenBSD](https://man.openbsd.org/head.1). `dd` would definitely work on all Unix systems in practice, however, due to how `dd` works it may come with a performance hit (not to mention it's not pretty).\r\n\r\nI've tried piping into `head -c`, however, in POSIX sh it can't easily be done when you also want to check curl's error code. This is because `head` (the last command run in the pipeline) will conceal curl's error code. `set -o pipefail` can be used to propagate curl's error code but again, [only recently added to POSIX](https://www.austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=789) and popular shells like Dash have yet to support it.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I think this security feature should be doable in curl without requiring a shell. The above doesn't cover Windows of course.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1709520053/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ElliotKillick","id":58203150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjAzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58203150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick","html_url":"https://github.com/ElliotKillick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliotKillick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10303499467,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c5wXL6izwAAAAJmIuzL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/10303499467","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-07T06:58:41Z","label":{"name":"cmdline

you curl team for the fast response and turnaround on this issue!\r\n\r\nI find the description of this issue coincides with [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html). Do you think it's worth advising users with a minor CVE? Due to curl's popularity, there are probably cases (e.g. on an embedded device with few resources and no GNU coreutils/Bash) where an automated script could run into this weakness with no easily portable way to fix it on their side until now. Thanks so much
