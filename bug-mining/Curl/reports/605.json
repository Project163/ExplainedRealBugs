Edit at your own risk.\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n# Your HSTS cache. https://curl.se/docs/hsts.html\r\n# This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.\r\n```\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI expected the URLs to lead to documentation describing the format of those files (if contractual) and providing user guidance about the impact of deleting those files.  Instead they 404.  The documentation seems to have been deliberately removed in https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/14553 and https://github.com/curl/curl-www/commit/17eca8748b4cc3d772d857cd6a7a8387730e4d81 because it is documented elsewhere.  Consider redirecting to the other documentation.  If there is no appropriate redirect, new versions of curl should stop emitting those URLs when writing the files.\r\n\r\n(Whether this is a code bug or a docs bug depends on how you resolve it.  I figured a clear report was more important than which issue template I used.)\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.11.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.11.0 OpenSSL/3.4.0 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.6 libidn2/2.3.7 libpsl/0.21.5 libssh2/1.11.0 nghttp2/1.64.0 nghttp3/1.6.0\r\nRelease-Date: 2024-11-06\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n\n### operating system\n\nLinux promenade 6.12.3-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri, 06 Dec 2024 11:15:43 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15705/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
