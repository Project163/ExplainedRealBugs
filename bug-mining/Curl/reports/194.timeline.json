find in #10690 my latest fix for putting a lid not this issue.\r\n\r\nBackground: the refactoring from 7.87 to 7.88 failed to properly preserve the handling of pending input on connection reuse. For `http` connections, having input arriving from a server is considered bad, since the server should not send anything unless there is some issue.\r\n\r\nFor https: connections the most common case of pending input is a TLS notify close message, e.g. the server was done with it.\r\n\r\nThe PR restores the previous way of checking for
