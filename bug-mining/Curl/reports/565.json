(and of course auth fails even for valid user). On the other hand, manually setting the header works, and also using:\r\n```\r\n$ curl --location-trusted \"https://edt.grenoble-inp.fr/directCal/2024-2025/enseignant?resources=0\" -v -u \"${USER}:${PASSWD}\"\r\n```\r\nworks (of course with dummy passwords you will not login successfully, but the log show that the user appear also in the second message).
