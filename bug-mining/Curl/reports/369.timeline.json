Hopefully there's enough that might give you all some hints on what's happening.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/b16d1fa8ee567b52c09a0f89940b07d8491b881d/lib/http2.c#L1049C22-L1060\r\n\r\nAn engineer looking at the crash dumps see that the address indicated for `Curl_easy *data_s` had been discarded and the address retrieved from `data_s->p.http` is invalid. Writing `TRUE` to `stream->closed` triggered the crash.\r\n\r\nThey went further into the crash dumps and saw that when it happened the value of `error_code` passed to `on_stream_close` corresponded to `NGHTTP2_STREAM_CLOSED` for 317 out of 318 reports. The single outlier had the register holding that value set to `NGHTTP2_REFUSED_STREAM`.\r\n\r\nWe've yet to create a reduced case that triggers the issue. If we get that we'll follow up back here.
