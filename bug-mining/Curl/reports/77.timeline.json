This does not appear to automatically detect the proxy on my corporate network.\r\n\r\nI have tried solutions suggested in #224 \r\n\r\n```\r\nSys.setenv(ALL_PROXY = \"http://corporate_proxy:8080/\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nas well as \r\n\r\n```\r\nSys.setenv(ALL_PROXY = \":@http://corporate_proxy:8080/\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\nSys.setenv(\r\n  proxy = \"http://corporate_proxy:8080\", \r\n  proxyuserpwd = \":\"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut these give me a 407 error after connecting to the proxy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following works, which tells me I have the right corporate proxy settings:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nh <- curl::new_handle(proxy = \"http://corporate_proxy:8080\", \r\n                      proxyuserpwd = \":\")\r\n\r\ncurl::curl_download(\"https://www.abs.gov.au/robots.txt\", destfile = \"robots.txt\", handle = h)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn RCurl, I can pass these with the following code which allows all RCurl requests to run:\r\n\r\n```\r\noptions(RCurlOptions = list(\r\n  proxy = \"http://vip_webproxy:8080\",\r\n  proxyuserpwd = \":\",\r\n  proxyauth = 8\r\n))\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust wondering how to get curl to automatically use the proxy settings for all subsequent requests? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n(Pinging @MattCowgill & @HughParsonage for visibility)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n> sessionInfo()\r\nR version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22)\r\nPlatform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)\r\nRunning under: Windows 10 x64 (build 18363)\r\n\r\nMatrix products: default\r\n\r\nlocale:\r\n[1] LC_COLLATE=English_Australia.1252  LC_CTYPE=English_Australia.1252   \r\n[3] LC_MONETARY=English_Australia.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C                      \r\n[5] LC_TIME=English_Australia.1252    \r\n\r\nattached base packages:\r\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \r\n\r\nother attached packages:\r\n[1] readabs_0.4.6.900\r\n\r\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\r\n [1] Rcpp_1.0.5        pillar_1.4.6      compiler_4.0.2    cellranger_1.1.0  plyr_1.8.6       \r\n [6] bitops_1.0-6      tools_4.0.2       digest_0.6.25     packrat_0.5.0     evaluate_0.14    \r\n[11] lifecycle_0.2.0   tibble_3.0.3      pkgconfig_2.0.3   rlang_0.4.7       fastmatch_1.1-0  \r\n[16] rstudioapi_0.11   curl_4.3          yaml_2.2.1        parallel_4.0.2    xfun_0.16        \r\n[21] dplyr_1.0.0       httr_1.4.2        knitr_1.29        xml2_1.3.2        generics_0.0.2   \r\n[26] vctrs_0.3.2       tidyselect_1.1.0  data.table_1.13.0 glue_1.4.1        R6_2.4.1         \r\n[31] rsdmx_0.5-14      XML_3.99-0.5      readxl_1.3.1      rmarkdown_2.3     purrr_0.3.4      \r\n[36] tidyr_1.1.0       magrittr_1.5      hutils_1.5.1      ellipsis_0.3.1    htmltools_0.5.0  \r\n[41] fst_0.9.2         rvest_0.3.6       stringi_1.4.6     RCurl_1.98-1.2    crayon_1.3.4     \r\n\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeroen/curl/issues/237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeroen/curl/issues/237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1173047184","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9088#issuecomment-1173047184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9088","id":1173047184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5F60eQ","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-03T09:35:57Z","updated_at":"2022-07-03T09:35:57Z","body":"> Is this expected?\r\n\r\nI don't think anyone has thought about it.
