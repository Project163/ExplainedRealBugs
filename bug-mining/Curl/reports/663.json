It crashes while connecting to a name that it found in its DNS cache.\n\nI believe this is due to the easy handle's `conn->dns_entry` field being `NULL`. `Curl_once_resolved` sets it from `state.async.dns`, but only if `CURL_USE_ASYNC` is defined ([lib/hostip.c:1439](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/hostip.c#L1442)):\n\n```c\n#ifdef USE_CURL_ASYNC\n  if(data->state.async.dns) {\n    conn->dns_entry = data->state.async.dns;\n    data->state.async.dns = NULL;\n  }\n#endif\n```\n\nHowever, `state_resolving` only sets `state.async.dns` when `CURLRES_ASYNCH` is defined ([lib/multi.c:2090](https://github.com/curl/curl/blame/master/lib/multi.c#L2090)):\n\n```c\n#ifdef CURLRES_ASYNCH\n    data->state.async.dns = dns;\n    data->state.async.done = TRUE;\n#endif\n```\n\nIn my configuration, `CURLRES_ASYNCH` is _not_ set, but `USE_CURL_ASYNC` is set. Thus, `conn->dns_entry` stays `NULL` and curl crashes accessing this field while connecting (in [cf_he_connect:973](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/f8e7a4df94393bc23bf10e1dd1e9e8bd7655be9f/lib/connect.c#L973)).\n\n[lib/urldata.h:566](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/urldata.h#L566) defines `USE_CURL_ASYNC` when `CURLRES_ASYNCH` is defined or when `CURL_DISABLE_DOH` is not defined.\n\nI don't know curl well enough to suggest a fix, but changing the `#ifdef CURLRES_ASYNCH` in `multi.c` to `#ifdef USE_CURL_ASYNC` works and seems correct from my understanding.\n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\nI have seen this with curl 8.12.1 and with latest main as of now (`f8e7a4d`).\n\n### operating system\n\nLinux fedora 6.13.5-200.fc41.aarch64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Feb 27 15:30:52 UTC 2025 aarch64 GNU/Linux","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
