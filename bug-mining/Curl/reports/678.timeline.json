I have somewhat limited availability today (power outages from an ice storm) but I took a quick initial peek.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have any immediate theories. The test itself doesn't appear related to any of my recent changes (e.g. isn't using ECH, mTLS, etc) 🤔. It's possible it's shaking out a bug from the rustls-ffi update itself and not the vTLS changes. That might be an interesting avenue to try and hone in on.\n\nI had to run the test locally ~149 times before I finally caught a failure.

both failing in `Curl_failf()`. In the ASAN trace there is only call to `Curl_failf()` in `cf_h2_on_invalid_frame_recv()`, which has two string pointers. One points to a stack-allocated array which can't be the problem, whereas the other gets the pointer from `nghttp2_strerror()`. I'm guessing something fishy is going on in that function. Does the problem go away with a different version of nghttp2?\n\nIn the first backtrace, the `Curl_failf()` call on line 1591 is `failf(data_s, \"Internal NULL stream\");` which has a static string argument so that can't be it. The `data_s` parameter comes from `nghttp2_session_get_stream_user_data()` so it looks like that's where the bad pointer comes from.  Adding a `DEBUGASSERT(data->magic == CURLEASY_MAGIC_NUMBER);` in `Curl_failf()` would help pinpoint a bad pointer being passed in.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2767274593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17072600447,"node_id":"AE_lADOAAiu0c6wYkx8zwAAAAP5mzV_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/17072600447","actor":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-01T10:11:13Z","assignee":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2768879660","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16881#issuecomment-2768879660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16881","id":2768879660,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6lCcAs","user":{"login":"icing","id":15102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing","html_url":"https://github.com/icing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-01T10:16:37Z","updated_at":"2025-04-01T10:16:37Z","body":"Running this normally, did not reproduce in several 100 iterations, but I get it pretty fast via\n\n```sh\n> make -j20 && (cd tests && make -j20 && CURL_DBG_SOCK_RBLOCK=50 pytest -v -k \"test_09_02\" --count=100 --maxfail=1)\n```\n\nwhich makes the socket receive return EAGAIN 50% of the times.
