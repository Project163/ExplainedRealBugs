test-ci target now uses 2 processes by default, but the amount of\r\nparallelism is tuned for each CI service and build environment based on\r\nresults of a number of test runs.  Some CI services use super-\r\noversubscribed build machines that can barely run the curl tests\r\nalready with no parallelism without frequently failing with\r\ntiming-induced failures. These continue to be run without parallelism.\r\nOther services provide two fast, unloaded cores and these run with 14\r\nprocesses, which is a good default for this kind of environment.\r\n\r\nHere's a summary of the number of test processes by CI service:\r\n\r\n  Appveyor - 2 (Windows MSVC), 1 (others)\r\n  Azure - 2\r\n  Circle CI - 14\r\n  Cirrus - 28 (macOS), 14 (Linux), 7 (FreeBSD), 5 (macOS torture), 2 (Windows)\r\n  GitHub Actions - 3 (macOS), 2 (Linux)\r\n\r\nSome of these are a bit conservative to keep timing-induced flakiness down.\r\n\r\nThe net result is that the first test results should arrive only\r\n3 minutes after a commit submission.\r\n\r\nChanges merged via separate commits:\r\n- 2a7c8b27fdd266894fe24d6d0f5d853ea843dff4 #14171\r\n-

What's also interesting is the varied value for `current`; 912868768 the first time then 65023 for all subsequent calls. The actual value should have been 1697053066 in all cases.\r\n\r\nI don't see any relationship between the various time values above on the bit level (although it's interesting that 65023 has 15 of 16 binary 1 bits). Both numbers are set with time(2) and they're both using `time_t` as the receiving type, which is the correct one. But, it's hard to believe  the time(2) call would be returning such wildly incorrect values.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1758469739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1760635606","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12040#issuecomment-1760635606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12040","id":1760635606,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5o8SrW","user":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-13T01:39:50Z","updated_at":"2023-10-13T01:39:50Z","body":"One more data point: this test has been failing only on the *CMake, mingw-w64, gcc 9, Debug x64, Schannel, Static, Unity* build, and it started failing the day after the job was created.
