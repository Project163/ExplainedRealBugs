decoding + URL encoding every URL part, independently and then put the cleansed versions together into a full URL. This process can however not be an *unconditional*  decode + encode for each part since generally URL encoding would encode characters that users might actually prefer even need to have as-is in the URL. An example being `=` in the query part, that is typically treated differently than `%3D`.
