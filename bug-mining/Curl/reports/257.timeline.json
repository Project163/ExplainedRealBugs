Even if we remove all our own buffers, nghttp2\r\nstill buffers the DATA frame if sending it would block.\r\n\r\nThe problem with buffered upload data arises on the very last chunk. If that write reports success, the transfer loop stops monitoring the connection for output and waits for a server reply. This will not come until the server times out the upload and RSTs the stream.\r\n\r\n## Update\r\n\r\nThis PR is not it. I will make a new attempt next week.
