I did this\n\n\r\nThere was an issue in Tarantool [^1] due to regression in libcurl (#11769), it was reported on 23 Aug, 2023. Issue was fixed in upstream on 4 Sept, 2023 and fix was confirmed by our tests for Tarantool. Unfortunately, this fix was ruined by refactoring made in commit d7b6ce64ce0ad (\"lib: replace readwrite with write_resp\") [3] on 1 Dec 2023, and now it is reproduced again. Then it was fixed in #13260 and regression test was added within fix. However, commit 270a25c011367f6300d5c01497fb1f23527458f4 that fixes #13337 broke fix again.\r\n\r\n- Reproducer for Tarantool is described in [^1]\r\n- Reproducer for libcurl is described in #11769,
