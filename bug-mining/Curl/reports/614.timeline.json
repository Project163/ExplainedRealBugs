I don't know how to better debug this in Amiga except with printfs to find a good point before the corruption occurs. Apparently stack traces are possible, see https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Using_Crash-Logs_for_Debugging\r\n\r\nThanks for the assistance Jay this is much appreciated!\r\n\r\nSo tonight's testing, I can confirm there is no network tcp stack working in the curl compiled exe.\r\nIf I turn off the amiga TCP stack (Roadshow) the same error occurs. curl (3): URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL\r\n\r\nI've been trying to work our how the curl code works with Amiga TCP stacks\r\nLooking at libs/amigaos.c this has code to open the bsdsocket.library for AmigaOS3 and fail if it doesn't work.\r\nit also is referencing amitcp/socketbasetags.h if we are using AmiSSL\r\nThe Amiga GCC has this included in the amitcp folder so should be OK\r\n\r\nMy Amiga uses Roadshow as it's TCP stack (it's newer - and my other Amiga use this) I assume it shouldn't matter on the Amiga side, as bsdsocket.library is included with Roadshow as well.\r\n\r\nI've tried changing this to roadshows newer TCP SDK by changing the include to <bsdsocket/socketbasetags.h> as well but so far all builds have no TCP stack support.\r\n\r\nMore testing this weekend\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2477604498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"boingball","id":33876110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODc2MTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33876110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball","html_url":"https://github.com/boingball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2480038144","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/15537#issuecomment-2480038144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15537","id":2480038144,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6T0mEA","user":{"login":"boingball","id":33876110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODc2MTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33876110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball","html_url":"https://github.com/boingball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boingball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-15T22:20:44Z","updated_at":"2024-11-15T22:20:44Z","body":"So tonight I'm concentrating on the Amigaos.c and Amigaos.H\r\n\r\nAmigaos.h seems to have a couple of functions in it that setup curl for Amiga and how to attach the socket library\r\n\r\nGetting them to add there functions in at build time gives an error - \r\n\r\n  CCLD     curl\r\n/opt/amiga13/lib/gcc/m68k-amigaos/13.2.0/../../../../m68k-amigaos/bin/ld: /opt/amiga13/lib/libamisslauto.a(autoinit_assl.o):autoinit_assl.o:(.data+0x4): multiple definition of `SocketBase';
