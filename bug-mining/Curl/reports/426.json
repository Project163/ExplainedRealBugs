Turns out we have a regression with an AUR helper application [auracle](https://github.com/inglor/auracle), that links against `libcurl`. Sadly output is little to no useful only:\r\n```\r\n% auracle clone st\r\nerror: UNKNOWN: \r\n```\r\nRunning `git bisect` I was pointed at 463472a2d6e3301c1468b5323b856cb67a91f579 being the first bad commit.\r\n\r\nInvestigating the code I landed in [src/aur/aur.cc line 468](https://github.com/inglor/auracle/blob/6fdcc4de11cd95ba66f5fe68a45bed6ca21a239c/src/aur/aur.cc#L468) where `msg` is assigned, and `msg->data.result` some lines below is `23`, which is `CURLE_WRITE_ERROR`. With `curl 8.6.0` the result was `0` or `CURLE_OK`.\r\n\r\nFrom the commit message it is not obvious to me if the public api is supposed to change - I guess no. (Everything else should require a `soname` bump anyway.) So not sure what to blame here... Also possible that the api was misused and worked by chance only.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nThe application should continue to work as expected, downloading its content with `libcurl`.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\n```\r\n% pacman -Q curl\r\ncurl 8.7.1-1\r\n```\r\n```\r\n% curl --version\r\ncurl 8.7.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.7.1 OpenSSL/3.2.1 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.5 libidn2/2.3.7 libpsl/0.21.2 libssh2/1.11.0 nghttp2/1.60.0 nghttp3/1.2.0\r\nRelease-Date: 2024-03-27\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\r\n```\n\n### operating system\n\n*Arch Linux* with testing repositories enabled","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
