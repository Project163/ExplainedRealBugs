recently upgraded to curl 7.86.0 from 7.84.0 and noticed that the proxy information is not being reported correctly in the log messages.\r\n\r\n```\r\nswgroup@fwdev2-astamp:~/ES2$ http_proxy=http://192.168.2.1:8080 ./curl-7.86.0/src/curl -sv google.com -o /dev/null\r\n* Uses proxy env variable http_proxy == 'http://192.168.2.1:8080'\r\n*   Trying 192.168.2.1:8080...\r\n* Connected to (nil) (192.168.2.1) port 8080 (#0)\r\n> GET http://google.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\n```\r\nwhere 7.84.0 shows the proxy info correctly.\r\n\r\n```\r\nswgroup@fwdev2-astamp:~/ES2$ http_proxy=http://192.168.2.1:8080 ./curl-7.84.0/src/curl -sv google.com -o /dev/null\r\n* Uses proxy env variable http_proxy == 'http://192.168.2.1:8080'\r\n*   Trying 192.168.2.1:8080...\r\n*

http://google.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice `Connected to (nil) (192.168.2.1) port 8080 (#0)` in 7.86 vs. `Connected to 192.168.2.1 (192.168.2.1) port 8080 (#0)` in 7.84.\r\n\r\nBoth versions of curl were configured with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --prefix=/home/swgroup --with-openssl --enable-verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears to be related to this commit: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/53bcf55b4538067e6dc36242168866becb987bb7\r\n\r\nIn `lib/url.c` the calls to `Curl_idnconvert_hostname` were moved to `parseurlandfillconn()` which is called before `create_conn_helper_init_proxy` in `create_conn`.\r\nWhile we are not using libidn2, `Curl_idnconvert_hostname` is where the `dispname` member of `struct hostname` is populated.\r\nSince the calls are gated by `conn->bits.httpproxy`/`conn->bits.socksproxy`, the names are not converted since the bits are only set in `create_conn_helper_init_proxy`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to resolve this and still maintain the changes for HSTS needed for that commit, otherwise I'd propose a patch.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n--Andy\r\n\r\n### I did this\r\n\r\nWith a proxy running at the specified info:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$

8080 (#0)` as is observed in curl 7.84.0.\r\nbut instead received: `Connected to (nil) (192.168.2.1) port 8080 (#0)`\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./curl-7.86.0/src/curl -V\r\ncurl
