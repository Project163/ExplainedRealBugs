The failure occurs in a `HAVE_PIPE` build which means that instead of a socketpair, a pipe is opened at [asyn-thread.c:254](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-8_6_0/lib/asyn-thread.c#L254); however, it's closed in this error path using sclose at [asyn-thread.c:584](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-8_6_0/lib/asyn-thread.c#L584). sclose is replaced by the memdebug subsystem and seen by it but pipe is not, so it appears to the leak checker like a close without an open.\r\n\r\nBuilding with `HAVE_PIPE` means it creates a socketpair instead of a pipe, except that socketpair is also not tracked by the memory tracker so once again it sees a close without an open.\r\n\r\nI don't know how this ever passed the leak checker. Every test using the resolver ought to error out here.\r\n\r\nOn a related not, I don't think the sclose() at [asyn-thread.c:584](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-8_6_0/lib/asyn-thread.c#L584) is right; I think it should be wakeup_close. Although, that won't fix the torture test because it seems to be a limitation fo the leak checker.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1920506159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11665589833,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c592p67zwAAAAK3UsZJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/11665589833","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-01T07:23:35Z","label":{"name":"tests","color":"a7a8e8"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1920672051","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12834#issuecomment-1920672051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12834","id":1920672051,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5yeyEz","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-01T07:31:03Z","updated_at":"2024-02-01T07:31:03Z","body":"> I don't know how this ever passed the leak checker\r\n\r\nBecause we used to disable the memory tracking with the threaded resolver due to problems with the logging from multiple threads.
