specifically the OID `1.2.840.113549.1.9.2` - `unstructuredName`\r\n\r\nThe segfault (nullptr dereference) happens on this line:\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/fd0d2ed74afed3e3b169ef6b780818e984707548/lib/vtls/x509asn1.c#L694\r\n\r\nThe issue comes from `OID2str` when `searchOID` is invoked. `OIDtable` is searched, entry `1.2.840.113549.1.9.2` is not found and the function returns `NULL`. However, the `result` stays `CURLE_OK` so the calling code assumes the dynbuf is perfectly valid when it is in fact still in unallocated state.\r\n\r\nFor the record, the issue started occurring with commit https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/623c3a8fa0bdb2751f14b3741760d81910b7ec64 since version 8.6.0.\r\n\r\nI'm also attaching a patch that may be helpful.\r\n[x509asn1.patch](https://github.com/curl/curl/files/15346620/x509asn1.patch)\r\n\n\n### I expected the following\n\nNot a crash\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.6.0\n\n### operating system\n\nWindows 10 (x64, 22631)","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13684/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
