That left 4\r\nuses of `check_library_exists_concat()`. Only one of these actually\r\nneeded the 'concat' feature (ldap/lber).\r\n\r\nDelete this function and replace it with standard\r\n`check_library_exists()` and manual management of our `CURL_LIBS`\r\nlist we use when linking build targets. And special logic to handle the\r\nldap/lber case.\r\n\r\n(We have a similar function for headers: `check_include_file_concat()`.\r\nIt works, but problematic for performance reasons and because it hides\r\nthe actual headers required in `check_symbol_exists()` calls.)\r\n\r\nRef: #11537 #11558\r\nFixes #11285\r\nFixes #11648\r\nCloses #12070","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12070/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10658463524,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAiu0c5oRWW_zwAAAAJ7Sz8k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/10658463524","actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"84a65791320e5e2f08bd05954f2b12d5ee8778a8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/84a65791320e5e2f08bd05954f2b12d5ee8778a8","created_at":"2023-10-15T20:49:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11664617504,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c5oRWW_zwAAAAK3Q_Ag","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/11664617504","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"84a65791320e5e2f08bd05954f2b12d5ee8778a8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webfutureiorepo/curl/commits/84a65791320e5e2f08bd05954f2b12d5ee8778a8","created_at":"2024-02-01T05:10:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
