I did this\n\nSetting the rate to huge number triggers an integer overflow in set_rate function. \n````\ncurl --url \"http:/127.0.0.1\" --rate 5/12345678999999999s \n\ncurl: too large --rate unit \nillegal hardware instruction  curl --url \"http:/127.0.0.1\" --rate 5/12345678999999999s \n\n````\nI posted this here, cuz it it has no security impact (I believe) , just a normal bug .. \n\n\n### I expected the following\n\n\nthis will bypass the check (In set_rate() function)\n \n```\n    if((LONG_MAX / numerator) < numunits) {\n      /* overflow, too large number */\n      errorf(\"too large
