I discovered during work on #12897, libcurl does not support use of `inline` keyword because libcurl can be built with unusual combination of old compiler and cmake.\r\nWhen built by old compiler and autotools (configure), `inline` macro is defined to a suitable replacement (or empty string) if need.\r\nThe missing part is cmake checks for `inline` support.\r\nThis PR adds support for cmake detection of `inline`.\r\nAs a fallback path, `inline` compiler-time detection is implemented in `curl_setup.h`, so even if build system does not check for inline support for any reason the header will substitute a suitable replacement.\r\n\r\nWith this PR merged, libcurl and curl code can freely use `inline` keyword.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2168822193","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/13439#issuecomment-2168822193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13439","id":2168822193,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6BRZmx","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-14T22:06:11Z","updated_at":"2024-06-14T22:06:11Z","body":"This
