Later in the code (in `ssh_statemachine`), it inspects the last char of `sshp->path` to decide if it's going to `SSH_SFTP_READDIR_INIT` or `SSH_SFTP_DOWNLOAD_INIT`. As you might have guessed by now, for the `/~` case, it tries to download `/home/<user>` and things fail.\n\nHere is a proposed patch to fix the issue:\n\n```diff\nFrom e8e59da93bdc76b9776c49ed7c1bfc7659504ebc Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001\nFrom: Carlos Henrique Lima Melara <charlesmelara@riseup.net>\nDate: Thu, 5 Jun 2025 02:32:50 +0000\nSubject: [PATCH] curl_path: make SFTP path /~ returns /home/<user>/\n\n---\n lib/vssh/curl_path.c | 5 +++++\n 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)\n\ndiff --git a/lib/vssh/curl_path.c b/lib/vssh/curl_path.c\nindex 117d2e600..be150f454 100644\n--- a/lib/vssh/curl_path.c\n+++ b/lib/vssh/curl_path.c\n@@ -83,6 +83,11 @@ CURLcode Curl_getworkingpath(struct Curl_easy *data,\n         free(working_path);\n         return CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY;\n       }\n+    } else {\n+      if(curlx_dyn_add(&npath, \"/\")) {\n+        free(working_path);\n+        return CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY;\n+      }\n     }\n   }\n\n--\n2.47.2\n\n```\n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.14.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.14.1 OpenSSL/3.5.0 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.7 libidn2/2.3.8 libpsl/0.21.2 libssh2/1.11.1 nghttp2/1.64.0 nghttp3/1.8.0 librtmp/2.3 OpenLDAP/2.6.9\nRelease-Date: 2025-06-04, security patched: 8.14.1-2\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n\n\n### operating system\n\nDebian testing","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
