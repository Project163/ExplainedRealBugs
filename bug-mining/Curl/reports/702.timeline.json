I did this\n\nThe following has worked fine up to and including v. 8.11.0. I am trying to upgrade to 8.12.1 and I start to see this issue.\n\nTo support different ftp servers I have the following logic in my code:\n* Try and send a MLSD command - if it succeeds, then read and parse the response - we are good\n* If it fails with `FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE`, then try and send a LIST command - read and parse the response\n\nMy problem exist when the server does not support the MLSD command, and I then re-use the curl easy handle for the next LIST command. There is a call to `curl_easy_reset` in between the two perform operations. This has worked fine until now, but I now get a `SSL_CACERT` error code when running the second LIST perform operation. It seems as if the handle is not correctly reset with respect to tls when reset is invoked on a handle that has returned an error.\n\nIf I use two different curl easy handles, one for each of the commands, then it works just fine.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Verbose output from the debug function for a session to a vsftpd server that does not support MLSD</summary>\n\n```\n[1] Creating curl
