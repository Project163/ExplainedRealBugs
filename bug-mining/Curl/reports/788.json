Specify which documentation you found a problem with\n\nHello team!\n\nI commonly use the https://curl.se/docs/http3.html page as guide to build curl with HTTP3.\n\nSo, my usual scenario looked like:\n\n```\n./configure \\\n    LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,-rpath,/home/p/openssl/build/lib\"\n    --prefix=\"/home/p/curl\"\n    --with-openssl=\"/home/p/openssl/build\"\n    --with-nghttp3=\"/home/p/nghttp3/build\"\n    --with-ngtcp2=\"/home/p/ngtcp2/build\"\n    --with-nghttp2=\"/home/p/nghttp2/build\"\n    --enable-httpsrr\n```\n\n### The problem\n\nBut now during attempt to build curl from the current master branch with ngtcp2 `v1.14.0` and nghttp3 `v1.11.0` I get the following error:\n\n```\nconfigure: error: --with-ngtcp2 was specified but could not find ngtcp2_crypto_ossl pkg-config file.\n```\n\nAfter some changes and looking at https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/99500660af19f89069e71c2251c13963401b3806 I use the following approach to build curl:\n\n```\n./configure \\\n    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"/home/p/openssl/build/lib/pkgconfig:/home/p/nghttp3/build/lib/pkgconfig:/home/p/ngtcp2/build/lib/pkgconfig:/home/p/nghttp2/build/lib/pkgconfig\"\n    LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,-rpath,/home/p/openssl/build/lib\"\n    --prefix=\"/home/p/curl\"\n    --with-openssl=\"/home/p/openssl/build\"\n    --with-openssl-quic\n    --enable-httpsrr\n```\n\nIt seems need to update guide on the https://curl.se/docs/http3.html page.","closed_by":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
