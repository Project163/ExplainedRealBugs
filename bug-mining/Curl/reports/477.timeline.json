In other words, if they intend to fix the problems then I don't think the workarounds should go in. Hats off to you though for figuring some out. Also- I don't understand why curl passes all tests for me with 3.6.0 if it was intended behavior on their part.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2142734212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13031135881,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAiu0c6I6FRmzwAAAAMIt1qJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/13031135881","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"5f9017d4e28096b4589c4d5ee4f18cae086ba777","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/5f9017d4e28096b4589c4d5ee4f18cae086ba777","created_at":"2024-06-04T07:03:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13033015715,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c6I6FRmzwAAAAMI1Amj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/13033015715","actor":{"login":"dyhkwong","id":50692134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjkyMTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50692134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong","html_url":"https://github.com/dyhkwong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyhkwong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5f9017d4e28096b4589c4d5ee4f18cae086ba777","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dyhkwong/curl/commits/5f9017d4e28096b4589c4d5ee4f18cae086ba777","created_at":"2024-06-04T09:13:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jqyisbest","id":16437320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM3MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16437320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest","html_url":"https://github.com/jqyisbest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jqyisbest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-16T11:59:49Z","updated_at":"2024-06-16T11:59:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/juewuy/ShellCrash/issues/668","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/juewuy/ShellCrash","la
