unexpectedly detects `arc4random` because it is also looking\r\ninto dependency libs. One dependency, LibreSSL, happens to publish an\r\n`arc4random` function (via its shared lib before v3.7, also via static\r\nlib as of v3.8.2). When trying to use this function in `lib/rand.c`,\r\nits protoype is missing. To fix that, curl included a prototype, but\r\nthat used a C99 type without including `stdint.h`, causing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n../../lib/rand.c:37:1: error: unknown type name 'uint32_t'\r\n   37 | uint32_t arc4random(void);\r\n      | ^\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch improves this by dropping the local prototype and instead\r\nlimiting `arc4random` use for non-OpenSSL builds. OpenSSL builds provide\r\ntheir own random source anyway.\r\n\r\nThe better fix would be to teach autotools to not link dependency libs\r\nwhile detecting `arc4random`.\r\n\r\nLibreSSL publishing a non-namespaced `arc4random` tracked here:\r\nhttps://github.com/libressl/portable/issues/928\r\n\r\nRegression from 755ddbe901cd0c921fbc3ac5b3775c0dc683bc73 #10672\r\n\r\nFixes #12257\r\nCloses #12274","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10870595565,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAiu0c51zON7zwAAAAKH8B_t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/10870595565","actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"7925ba431b9a099daee1fa21d36c21887f787ad5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/7925ba431b9a099daee1fa21d36c21887f787ad5","created_at":"2023-11-06T10:12:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11664619177,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c51zON7zwAAAAK3Q_ap","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/11664619177","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7925ba431b9a099daee1fa21d36c21887f787ad5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webfutureiorepo/curl/commits/7925ba431b9a099daee1fa21d36c21887f787ad5","created_at":"2024-02-01T05:10:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
