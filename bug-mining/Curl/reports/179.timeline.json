\r\nYes, problem happens with my apps 100% of the time if compiled with 7.88.0.\r\nIf recompiled with 7.86.0, they all work perfectly.\r\n\r\nI have only tested on one machine, Windows 10.\r\nEven when anti-virus and firewall are disabled, v7.86 works, and v7.88.0 fails.\r\n\r\nI downloaded a daily release, (curl-7.88.1-20230219.zip)\r\nbut that still has the same problem as 7.88.0.\r\n\r\n@bagder\r\nI am not a github power user.\r\nI tried downloading and compiling #10562, (curl-bagder-socketpair-block.zip)\r\nbut get a bunch of fatal errors about missing files when I try to compile LIB Release – DLL Windows SSPI – DLL WinIDN\r\nmissing files:\r\n..\\lib\\idn_win32.c\r\n..\\lib\\vquic\\msh3.c\r\n..\\lib\\vquic\\ngtcp2.c\r\n..\\lib\\vquic\\quiche.c\r\nI don't get these errors when compiling the master 7.86.0, or 7.88.0, so maybe I did something wrong downloading #10562.\r\n\r\nAnyway, based on the tests by others, it looks like your solution will probably fix my issue.\r\nBut I'll probably have to wait until it is included in a full master release to confirm myself.\r\nregards,\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1436198131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gunamoi1","id":3213442,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTM0NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3213442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1","html_url":"https://github.com/gunamoi1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunamoi1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8556686276,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c5ezYLuzwAAAAH-BKvE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8556686276","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-20T02:08:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8556686288,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c5ezYLuzwAAAAH-BKvQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8556686288","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-20T02:08:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8556686295,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c5ezYLuzwAAAAH-BKvX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8556686295","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-20T02:08:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8556686301,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c5ezYLuzwAAAAH-BKvd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8556686301","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"
