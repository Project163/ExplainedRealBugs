Earlier curl versions use the ALPN protocol \"**http/1.1**\", even for HTTP 1.0 requests.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the IIS server does not know the ALPN protocol \"http/1.0\". The [original ALPN specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7301) does not contain \"http/1.0\", but it contains \"http/1.1\".\r\n\r\nSide note: Firefox also uses the ALPN protocol \"http/1.1\" even if the setting \"network.http.version\" is set to \"1.0\".\r\n\r\nThis hack fixes the problem:\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/lib/vtls/vtls_int.h b/lib/vtls/vtls_int.h\r\nindex 2e65e6303..a7d76fcc9 100644\r\n--- a/lib/vtls/vtls_int.h\r\n+++ b/lib/vtls/vtls_int.h\r\n@@ -33,7 +33,7 @@\r\n #define ALPN_HTTP_1_1_LENGTH 8\r\n #define ALPN_HTTP_1_1 \"http/1.1\"\r\n #define ALPN_HTTP_1_0_LENGTH 8\r\n-#define ALPN_HTTP_1_0 \"http/1.0\"\r\n+#define ALPN_HTTP_1_0 \"http/1.1\"\r\n #define ALPN_H2_LENGTH 2\r\n #define ALPN_H2 \"h2\"\r\n #define ALPN_H3_LENGTH 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Use the parameter `--no-alpn`.\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\nSuccessful transfer\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\ncurl 8.5.0-DEV (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.5.0-DEV OpenSSL/3.0.9 nghttp2/1.52.0\r\nRelease-Date: [unreleased]\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IPv6 Largefile NTLM SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nFedora Linux 38","closed_by":{"login":"mkauf","id":12849992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODQ5OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12849992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf","html_url":"https://github.com/mkauf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkauf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
