ALPN is [an RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7301) and a mechanism to negotiate the underlying protocol. *any* protocol. They are negotiated using \"Protocol IDs\".

HTTP server supporting HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 will always have to detect the version in play from the request parsed.

But in practice, I do not see anyone doing that. Instead, all `http/1.*` ALPN values will switch to HTTP/1.* processing on that connection. And that was the intended behaviour when introducing ALPN, to differentiate between `h2` and \"use HTTP/1.* processing\" when seeing `http/1.1`.\r\n\r\nThat IIS is rejecting `http/1.0` seems a consequence of them saying \"we support `h2` and `http/1.1` here and this is neither of those, so we disengage. Apache chose another path with anything not specifically recognised being fed to HTTP/1.* - same as when no ALPN is used by the client. It can be debated which is the better approach.\r\n\r\nI think for `curl` it would suit users better to send `http/1.1` ALPN even if it knows the request itself is formulated as HTTP/1.0.
