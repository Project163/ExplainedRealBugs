following\n\nThere should be no delay between `[HAPPY-EYEBALLS] ipv4 trying next` and `Trying` / `cf_socket_open`.\r\n\r\nSometimes it works correctly, but sometimes it seems to sleep for the connect timeout delay before opening the socket (then it timeouts immediately).\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\nIssue seen with 8.3.0 and on master.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl 8.4.0-DEV (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
