When sent with a [503 (Service Unavailable)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#status.503) response, Retry-After indicates how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the client. When sent with any [3xx (Redirection)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#status.3xx) response, Retry-After indicates the minimum time that the user agent is asked to wait before issuing the redirected request.\r\n\r\nCurrently, curl respect the retry-after only for transient error conditions. Per documentation: Transient error means either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503 or 504 response code\r\n\r\nThe specific use case is to allow \"curl\" to follow \"retry-after\" when fetching API responses for time-consuming operation. The server can redirect the request to same URL, advertising a time when results may be expected. I'm using CURL to retrieve result for long-running calculation, via REST interface, where the server is using 303 with retry-after to implement retries, with backoff logic, based on the progress of the calculation.\r\n\r\nGiven that curl automatically respect retry-after for error condition - make sense to have this behavior by default (with command line options to override).\r\n\r\nTested with curl 7.29 - I do not have access to newer curl, but per documentation behavior in 8.X is the same as 7.66, when support was added to follow retry-after for error conditions.","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
