From this I conclude that is not a server fault.\r\n* The problem started with curl 8.6.0 and is reproducible across curl versions, up to the current 8.8.0.\r\n* With > 120 seconds, the interruption is not negligible.\r\n\r\nHopefully this helps to determine the cause.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2241138789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ralfjunker","id":1552416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTI0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1552416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker","html_url":"https://github.com/ralfjunker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralfjunker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13678469017,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c6PwXjBzwAAAAMvTN-Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/13678469017","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"167837db4ab7bde0310ebd3861532ace6a5f709e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/167837db4ab7bde0310ebd3861532ace6a5f709e","created_at":"2024-07-29T10:58:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-29T10:58:50Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T10:58:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14297","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14297/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14297/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/14297/events","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/14297","id":2435104606,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAiu0c52urTI","number":14297,"title":"test993:
