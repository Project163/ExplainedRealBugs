This does not happen when built `--with-secure-transport` rather than OpenSSL (which macOS's built-in curl does). OpenSSL 3.5.4 was obtained via MacPorts.\n\nRunning the curl command with `-v` printed this error message: `gss_init_sec_context() failed:  An unsupported mechanism was requested. unknown mech-code 0 for mech unknown.`\n\nI ran a `git bisect` between a last-known-good curl version (8.7.1) and the version in MacPorts that stopped working (8.13.0), which identified commit [0a5ea09a910e](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0a5ea09a910e7883fd7a1c333e8a36fc782fe537) (\"spnego_gssapi: implement TLS channel bindings for openssl\") as the breaking change. The PR #13098 associated with that commit notes, \"This change require krb5 >= 1.19, otherwise channel bindings won't be forwarded through SPNEGO.\"\n\nHowever, macOS does not use MIT Kerberos but rather [a fork of Heimdal](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Heimdal/tree/Heimdal-693.140.2). And while upstream Heimdal merged a [PR](https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/pull/712) to support channel binding, this has not been integrated into Apple's fork. It seems that macOS GSSAPI/Kerberos does not have the needed channel binding support for SPNEGO.\n\nA potential fix might be to condition setting the channel binding data in libcurl on the presence of the `GSS_C_CHANNEL_BOUND_FLAG` define in the `gssapi.h` header.\n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\nFails on both:\n\n```\ncurl 8.10.0-DEV (aarch64-apple-darwin25.0.0) libcurl/8.10.0-DEV OpenSSL/3.5.4 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.7 libidn2/2.3.8 libpsl/0.21.5 nghttp2/1.67.1\nRelease-Date: [unreleased]\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n```\n \n```\ncurl 8.16.0-DEV (aarch64-apple-darwin25.0.0) libcurl/8.16.0-DEV OpenSSL/3.5.4 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.7 libidn2/2.3.8 libpsl/0.21.5 nghttp2/1.67.1\nRelease-Date: [unreleased]\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n```\n\n### operating system\n\nTested on macOS 15.7.1 and 26.0.1\n\n```\nDarwin mactest1 25.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 25.0.0: Wed Sep 17 21:41:50 PDT 2025; root:xnu-12377.1.9~141/RELEASE_ARM64_T6030 arm64\n```","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/19109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
