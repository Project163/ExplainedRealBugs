work on a project that uses `cachix-action` and a private binary cache for CI, and it has been working really well. Today, I observed some problems where the cache was not being picked up, specifically the \"warning: XXX does not appear to be a binary cache\" message. After some debugging, I noticed that `install-nix-action` was installing Nix 2.10 -- which was really unexpected because I didn't know it came out today just a few hours ago! The problem went away after the nix version was pinned to 2.9.2.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this is a problem with Nix, cachix, or cachix-action, so I'd be happy to post this issue in a more
