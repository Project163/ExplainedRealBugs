[FIX] Handle Link-Local IPv6 Binding Properly Without Interface in URL\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\nWhen using a link-local IPv6 address in `curl`, it was necessary to include the interface in the URL (e.g., `%eth0`). The `--interface` option did not properly handle the binding for link-local IPv6 addresses, causing an error (`errno 22: Invalid argument`). This issue was reported in https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/14782 and affected scenarios where the user wanted to specify the interface separately.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\nThis pull request modifies `bindlocal()` in `lib/connect.c` to correctly handle link-local IPv6 addresses by automatically detecting and applying the interface scope if specified. Specifically:\r\n- If the provided address is a link-local IPv6 address and includes a scope ID (e.g., `%eth0`), it extracts the interface name, converts it to an index using `if_nametoindex()`, and assigns it to `sin6_scope_id`.\r\n- This allows `curl` to bind correctly without requiring the user to specify the scope within the URL itself.\r\n- This fix makes it more intuitive for users to connect to link-local IPv6 addresses, particularly when the interface is specified using `--interface`.\r\n\r\n#### Changes Made\r\n1. **`bindlocal()` Function Updates**:\r\n   - Detect link-local IPv6 addresses and parse the interface scope (if present).\r\n   - Use `if_nametoindex()` to convert the interface name to the appropriate scope ID.\r\n   - Apply the scope ID to `sin6_scope_id` to correctly bind the socket to the specified interface.\r\n\r\n2. **Error Handling**:\r\n   - Added appropriate error messages for invalid IPv6 addresses and invalid interface names.\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n- Verified that `curl` can now connect to link-local IPv6 addresses by specifying the interface using `--interface` without requiring `%interface` in the URL.\r\n- Ran existing IPv6-related tests to ensure no regressions.\r\n- Added new test cases to verify the correct handling of link-local addresses with and without interface scopes.\r\n\r\n#### Related Issues\r\n- Fixes [#14782](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/14782)\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\nThis change enhances user experience when working with link-local IPv6 addresses and ensures consistent behavior between the `--interface` option and the way URLs are interpreted.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16260178536,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c6VUF2xzwAAAAPJLqJo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/16260178536","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6bfb5f71760ed8c08a298da75a5f25934cdab797","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/6bfb5f71760ed8c08a298da75a5f25934cdab797","created_at":"2025-02-11T08:18:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-11T08:18:43Z","updated_at":"2025-02-11T08:18:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16295","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16295/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16295/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16295/events","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/16295","id":2844604296,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAiu0c6Kwukk","number":16295,"title":"KNOWN_BUGS:
