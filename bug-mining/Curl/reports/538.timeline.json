This was never intended to work. I think primarily because I have not seen a point in having this for proxies.\n\n@bagder My usecase is that I have `all_proxy` defined in my `.bashrc`, so it's always active, and it uses `socks5h://`. So when I went to use `--connect-to`, the option was seemingly silently ignored. Eventually I figured out that I needed to remove the `h` from all_proxy temporarily in order to use `--connect-to` during a one-off test.\n\nBut to me personally at least, it makes more sense that a command-line option like `--connect-to` would override any DNS settings, whether through a proxy or not. Especially when the alternative is to ignore the option entirely which is confusing for the user IMO.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2817335772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"otonoton","id":62482456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDgyNDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62482456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton","html_url":"https://github.com/otonoton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otonoton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17332203519,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAiu0c6SjtIjzwAAAAQJFG__","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/17332203519","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-20T20:53:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17332203523,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAiu0c6SjtIjzwAAAAQJFHAD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/17332203523","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-20T20:53:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
