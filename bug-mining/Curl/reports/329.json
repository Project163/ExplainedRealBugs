When we try to build it from sources, we get this when checksrc is ran:\r\n\r\n```\r\n09:20:40  ./tool_stderr.c:62:1: warning: STDERR already disabled from line 35 (BADCOMMAND)\r\n09:20:40     /* !checksrc! disable STDERR 1 */\r\n09:20:40   ^\r\n09:20:40  ./tool_stderr.c:69:1: warning: STDERR already disabled from line 35 (BADCOMMAND)\r\n09:20:40     /* !checksrc! disable STDERR 1 */\r\n09:20:40   ^\r\n09:20:40  ./tool_stderr.c:35:18: warning: Unused ignore: STDERR (UNUSEDIGNORE)\r\n09:20:40     /* !checksrc! disable STDERR 1 */\r\n09:20:40                    ^\r\n09:20:40  checksrc: 0 errors and 3 warnings\r\n09:20:40  checksrc: 0 errors and 10 warnings suppressed\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have downloaded this tarball https://curl.se/download/curl-8.4.0.tar.gz where apparently the newly added file `src/.checksrc` is missing. If we apply this patch to add it back, it works:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis file is committed in git, but missing from the curl 8.4.0 tarball, and makes the build fail if missing.\r\n\r\n--- /dev/null\r\n+++ src/.checksrc\r\n@@ -0,0 +1 @@\r\n+enable STDERR\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo... shall there be a new 8.4.1 release with the file included in the tarball ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRomain\n\n### I expected the following\n\nBuild works from the official tarball.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.4.0\n\n### operating system\n\nUbuntu 22.04.","closed_by":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12084/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
