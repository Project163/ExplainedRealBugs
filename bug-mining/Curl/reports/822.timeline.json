If you set a transfer timeout then libcurl can timeout the transfer so it would seem schannel_send is working correctly. But for that matter so is ossl_send, even though it doesn't have similar code to timeout. I don't know that we have a rule about this for transfers marked as connect only and I don't recall it ever having come up before.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3392546847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20226843434,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAAiu0c7Qrpj0zwAAAAS1nSMq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20226843434","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-11T19:31:49Z","label":{"name":"Windows","color":"0e8a16"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20226843439,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c7Qrpj0zwAAAAS1nSMv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/20226843439","actor":{"login":"jay","id":965580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTU4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay","html_url":"https://github.com/jay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-11T19:31:49Z","label":{"name":"libcurl API","color":"fef2c0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3395643630","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/18991#issuecomment-3395643630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18991","id":3395643630,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c7KZWju","user":{"login":"pps83","id":1614246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1614246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83","html_url":"https://github.com/pps83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-13T02:09:51Z","updated_at":"2025-10-13T02:18:38Z","body":"I could try to check non-ssl websock and see if it times out the same way as ssl one.

We can put timeout checks anywhere if necessary. There is a reason why we have a timeout check in parts of schannel because it has to block waiting for write in some cases, which should happen instantly but it's not guaranteed. It is not simply encrypting the data it is also sending it. For various reasons schannel records must be sent in whole. Other backends vary. They all may send differently. There's no separate internal encrypt state from send.\n\n@bagder @icing Not sure what to do here but we should have some consistency. If a timeout is set we either timeout for all or for none. IMO this is not an ssl issue, that just demonstrates the problem. We could support some sort of \"relaxed\" timeout in all cases, like in other words we wait for the application to call for easy_send/recv and check timeouts then, but there's no guarantee of timeout until the application calls that function.\n\nOr we could always return timeleft 0 after connect for connect only handles, like this\n\n~~~diff\ndiff --git a/lib/connect.c b/lib/connect.c\nindex
