I'd love to see Require.private work, have pkg-config recursively resolve dependencies, and have static linking work almost as easy as dynamic linking.\r\n\r\nBut `Requires.private` is not without problems:\r\n\r\n1. If a dependency was not detected with pkg-config during configure of curl, there should probably not be a reference to it under Requires*.\r\n2. Even if all dependencies were detected with pkg-config during configure of curl, it may not necessarily be the case that these .pc files exist on the target system. Notably `zlib` is unlikely to have a .pc file on an arbitrary system.\r\n\r\nIf every package always generated pc files, Requires is great. The reality is that this is not the case. Typically some autotools / cmake packages generate .pc files (by choice of the maintainer), but often there are multiple build systems (mbedtls has Makefile or CMake, zlib has its hand-written configure script or CMake, ...) which results in .pc files not being ubiquitous even for the same package.\r\n\r\nSo, I would say that requiring .pc files is just too strict, and maybe it should be opt-in.\r\n\r\n(I'm digressing, but IMO static libs should contain an extra metadata file that is equivalent to the dynamic section of shared libraries in ELF files, so that the linker can resolve dependencies of static libraries, and pkg-config becomes obsolete -- but unfortunately pkg-config remains needed for compiler flags like -I and -D.)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2451777119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"haampie","id":194764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDc2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie","html_url":"https://github.com/haampie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haampie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2451829864","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/15469#issuecomment-2451829864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15469","id":2451829864,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6SI_Ro","user":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-01T12:56:43Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T12:56:43Z","body":"Decisions made at libcurl.pc generation time will inevitably backfire in _some_ cases when using it in a different env.

There is also a built-in cmake way to disable it per target, and it's also possible to manually configure dependencies, in which case pkg-config is skipped. autotools builds don't have dedicated options like this, leaving pkg-config envs to control it.\r\n\r\nWe haven't heard of issues like this for other dependencies, and mbedtls's pkg-config support is fairly new, perhaps another place to fix this is mbedtls's Makefile builds?

idea of linking dependencies found to `libcurl.pc` turns out not\r\nto work in practice in some cases.\r\n\r\nSpecifically: gss, ldap, mbedtls, libmsh3, rustls\r\n\r\nA `.pc` may not work or be missing for a couple of reasons:\r\n- not all build methods generate it: mbedTLS, Rustls\r\n- generated file is broken: msh3\r\n  Ref: https://github.com/nibanks/msh3/pull/225\r\n- installed package flavour isn't shipping with one:\r\n  FreeBSD GSS, OmniOS LDAP, macOS LDAP\r\n\r\nThe effect of such issues shall be subtle in theory, because\r\n`libcurl.pc` normally lists these dependencies in the `Requires.private`\r\nsection meant for static linking. But, e.g. `pkg-config --exists`\r\nrequires these to be present, and builds sometimes use this check\r\nregardless of build type. This bug is not present in `pkgconf`; it only\r\nchecks for them when `--static` is also passed.\r\n\r\nFix these by adding affected `.pc` references to `libcurl.pc` only when\r\nwe detected the dependency via `pkg-config`.\r\n\r\nThere are a few side-effects of this solution:\r\n- references are never added for dependencies where curl doesn't\r\n  implement `pkg-config` detection. These are:\r\n  - autotools: ldap, mbedtls, msh3\r\n  - cmake: ldap (pending #15273)\r\n- generated `libcurl.pc` depends on the build-time environment.\r\n- generated `libcurl.pc` depends on curl build tool (cmake, autotools).\r\n- generated `libcurl.pc` depends on curl build implementation details.\r\n\r\nMake an exception for GNU GSS, where I blindly guess that `gss.pc` is\r\nalways available, as no issues were reported.\r\n\r\nOther, not mentioned, dependencies continue to be added regardless\r\nof the detection method.\r\n\r\nReported-by: Harmen Stoppels, Thomas, Daniel Engberg, Andy Fiddaman\r\nFixes #15469\r\nFixes #15507\r\nFixes #15535\r\nFixes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/15163#issuecomment-2473358444\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] Keep in sync with #15545\r\n- [x] Keep in sync with #15273\r\n- [x] Keep an eye on #15408","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15304749273,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c6crU5FzwAAAAOQO_DZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/15304749273","actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d511ec8b0a56b2a99226fe556abe9f815153c648","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/d511ec8b0a56b2a99226fe556abe9f815153c648","created_at":"2024-11-14T21:45:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17418998763,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c6crU5FzwAAAAQOQNPr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/17418998763","actor":{"login":"pps83","id":1614246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1614246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83","html_url":"https://github.com/pps83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pps83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a42fa1ce652869e450a8f18c23668c1f8b85be9f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pps83/curl/commits/a42fa1ce652869e450a8f18c23668c1f8b85be9f","created_at":"2025-04-26T22:33:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
