will fix the issue mentioned at https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/10626\r\n\r\nIn 7.87.0, if callback method for CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION returns CURL_SOCKOPT_ALREADY_CONNECTED then curl library used to return CURLE_OK. In 7.88.0, now even if callback returns CURL_SOCKOPT_ALREADY_CONNECTED, curl library still tries to connect to socket by invoking method do_connect().\r\n\r\nThis is regression caused by commit \r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/71b7e0161032927cdfb4e75ea40f65b8898b3956#diff-96ac2b9e301765fa5e816e0c41282610e9c0193a5852cc9bb0ed053b1fc4ef7f\r\n\r\nFix: Check if we are already connected and return CURLE_OK.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10648/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/10648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8636718427,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAiu0c5fdP5YzwAAAAICyd1b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8636718427","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"233810bb5f6c5e7bedfc10bdd36607b958c0cfe4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/233810bb5f6c5e7bedfc10bdd36607b958c0cfe4","created_at":"2023-03-01T10:52:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8694906749,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAAiu0c5fdP5YzwAAAAIGQb99","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/8694906749","actor":{"login":"sjadhavar","id":52494079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDk0MDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52494079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar","html_url":"https://github.com/sjadhavar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjadhavar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-08T09:59:38Z","rename":{"from":"[Windows] libcurl 7.88.0 - Immediate connect fail for: Socket is already connected","to":"[Windows] libcurl 7.88.0 - Immediate connect fail for x.x.x.x: Socket is already connected"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9866871090,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c5fdP5YzwAAAAJMHIEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/9866871090","actor":{"login":"bch","id":122211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjIxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch","html_url":"https://github.com/bch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"603c4c526c3c7267ba483278173e1dbb20a52baa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bch/curl/commits/603c4c526c3c7267ba483278173e1dbb20a52baa","created_at":"2023-07-19T20:01:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
