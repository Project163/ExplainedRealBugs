uses the CURL \"multi\" API and uses `CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION` to integrate it in its epoll-based I/O event loop. See https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD/blob/master/src/lib/curl/Global.cxx for the part that does this integration. There is nothing special here, I guess every program using CURL does it that way, that's how CURL is supposed to be integrated in non-blocking I/O loops, is it not?\r\n\r\nSo the problem is that returning `CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE` used to lead to a `CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION` call that would unregister the HTTP connection socket, effectively pausing the transfer (in CURL 8.4.0).\r\nThat `CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION` is no longer performed by CURL 8.5.0, and instead, CURL keeps receiving from the \"paused\" socket, buffering received data until the buffer eventually grows too large, causing `dyn_nappend()` to return `CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY`, failing the whole HTTP request.\r\n\r\nI expect `CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE` to effectively pause the transfer and never grow the `dynbuf` too large.\r\n\r\nCURL 8.5.0 does not actually pause the transfer and not receive any data; but all it actually does since 8.5.0 is omit the `WRITEFUNCTION` calls. But it really keeps receiving+buffering data.\r\n\r\nThis is a CURL regression; at best, this is a semantic ABI change which breaks at least one widely used application after the update. But I believe this is really a bug, not just some minor semantic change.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1876096341/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MaxKellermann","id":1443144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDMxNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1443144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxKellermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxKellermann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1876117965","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12632#issuecomment-1876117965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/12632","id":1876117965,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5v00nN","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-03T23:44:06Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T23:44:06Z","body":"@MaxKellermann
