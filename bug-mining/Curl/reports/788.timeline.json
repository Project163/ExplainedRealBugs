understanding is that all detections using the pattern\n`export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=<custom-path>` [^1] to look for\na component at that custom path, may be affected by this.\nThe issue is when the component has a dependency that's\nnot found at a default, system, location, because setting\n`PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR`, makes the classic `pkg-config` tool\nignore `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, which may point to those\ntransitive dependencies.\n\nQuestion how to tell pkg-config to look in `custom-path`\npreferably first, while respecting other custom locations set\nby the parent env. In a way that works with both classic\n`pkg-config` and `pkgconf`.\n\n`pkgconf` doesn't ignore `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` in this\ncase, so it should work (according to the documentation).\nBut it _appends_ the custom LIBDIR to PATH, so it won't\nbe looking at it first. Which might still be okay, hard to say.\n\nTried a [couple of ideas](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/18028/commits), without success, while working on\nthe ref-ed commit.\n\nedit: While figuring out
