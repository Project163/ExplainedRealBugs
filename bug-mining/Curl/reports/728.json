I did this\n\nQuote from [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-4.2.3):\n\n> the following three URIs are equivalent:\n> \n> ```\n> http://example.com:80/~smith/home.html\n> http://EXAMPLE.com/%7Esmith/home.html\n> http://EXAMPLE.com:/%7esmith/home.html\n> ```\n\nI wrote the following program (error handling and cleanup obviated):\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <curl/curl.h>\n\nstatic char *normalize(char const *dirty)\n{\n\tCURLU *cu;\n\tchar *clean;\n\n\tcu = curl_url();\n\tcurl_url_set(cu, CURLUPART_URL, dirty, 0);\n\tcurl_url_get(cu, CURLUPART_URL, &clean, 0);\n\n\treturn clean;\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", normalize(\"http://example.com/~smith/home.html\"));\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", normalize(\"http://exa%6Dple.com/%7Esmith/home.html\"));\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", normalize(\"http://exa%6dple.com/%7esmith/home.html\"));\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n\nIt prints\n\n```\nhttp://example.com/~smith/home.html\nhttp://example.com/%7Esmith/home.html\nhttp://example.com/%7esmith/home.html\n```\n\nWhich does not suggest equivalence (most software will think of them as different URIs).\n\n(Notice it normalized the redundant percent-encoding in the authority section, but not the one in the path.)\n\n(Additional likely redundant observation: The percent-encoding is canonically uppercase, so even if the percent should have been retained, the third URL should've been `%7E`, not `%7e`.)\n\nI'm aware of curl/trurl#329. Maybe this should have been fixed in the libcurl layer, not the trurl layer?\n\n### I expected the following\n\n`~` is an [unreserved character](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.3), therefore I expected\n\n```\nhttp://example.com/~smith/home.html\nhttp://example.com/~smith/home.html\nhttp://example.com/~smith/home.html\n```\n\n(Also: It seems it doesn't decode percent-encoding in the schema either, but I realize that'd probably be overkill.)\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.12.1\n\n### operating system\n\nDarwin [redacted] 24.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:16 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000 arm64","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16829/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
