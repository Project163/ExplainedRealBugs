'curl.o'\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's resolve this by skipping `libtool` and calling `windres` directly when building `src` (aka `curl.exe`). Leave `lib` unchanged, as it does need the `libtool` magic. This solution is compatible with building a static `curl.exe`.\r\n\r\nThis build scenario is not CI-tested.\r\n\r\nWhile here, delete an obsolete comment about a permanent `libtool` warning that we've resolved earlier.\r\n\r\nRegression from 6de7322c03d5b4d91576a7d9fc893e03cc9d1057\r\n\r\nReported-by: Christoph Reiter\r\nFixes #9803\r\nCloses #xxxx","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1292298229","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9803#issuecomment-1292298229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/9803","id":1292298229,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c5NBuf1","user":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-26T16:23:48Z","updated_at":"2022-10-26T16:23:48Z","body":"Odd as it is, using `windres` directly in `src` seems to fix it, while also not breaking static `curl.exe` builds.\r\n\r\n`autotools`-ways are really mysterious, so I'm not 100% confident this doesn't break some other scenario, but till we have a better idea about this, I suggest going with this one.\r\n\r\nPR: #9805\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1292298229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7679189430,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAiu0c5U37V-zwAAAAHJtyG2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/7679189430","actor":{"login":"vszakats","id":1446897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats","html_url":"https://github.com/vszakats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vszakats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b7260c4fda95196b2fa16f32b5913f25323e5098","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/commits/b7260c4fda95196b2fa16f32b5913f25323e5098","created_at":"2022-10-27T06:46:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
