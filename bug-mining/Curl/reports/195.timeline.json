automake used to delete depdirs at once (.deps) and there was an issue with portability, curl's XC_AMEND_DISTCLEAN greps the Makefiles in an attempt to build a list of all depfiles and delete them individually instead.\r\n\r\nSince commit 08849db866b44510f6b8fd49e313c91a43a3dfd3, automake switched from deleting directories to individual files. curl's custom logic now finds a lot more results with the grep (the filtering of these results isn't great), which causes a massive bloating of the Makefile in the order of O(n^2).\r\n\r\nReferences:
