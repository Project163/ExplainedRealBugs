I did this\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nSee my comments in #11958, it seems that the release tarball for curl 8.4.0 misses the file `src/.checksrc`. When we try to build it from sources, we get this when checksrc is ran:\r\n\r\n```\r\n09:20:40  ./tool_stderr.c:62:1: warning: STDERR already disabled from line 35 (BADCOMMAND)\r\n09:20:40     /* !checksrc! disable STDERR 1 */\r\n09:20:40   ^\r\n09:20:40  ./tool_stderr.c:69:1: warning: STDERR already disabled from line 35 (BADCOMMAND)\r\n09:20:40     /* !checksrc! disable STDERR 1 */\r\n09:20:40   ^\r\n09:20:40  ./tool_stderr.c:35:18: warning: Unused ignore: STDERR (UNUSEDIGNORE)\r\n09:20:40     /* !checksrc! disable STDERR 1 */\r\n09:20:40                    ^\r\n09:20:40  checksrc: 0 errors and 3 warnings\r\n09:20:40  checksrc: 0 errors and 10 warnings suppressed\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have downloaded this tarball https://curl.se/download/curl-8.4.0.tar.gz where apparently the newly added file `src/.checksrc` is missing. If we apply this patch to add it back, it works:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis file is committed in git, but missing from the curl 8.4.0 tarball, and makes the build fail if missing.\r\n\r\n--- /dev/null\r\n+++
