Specifically I am using the [`query` via GET](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/#query-via-get) operation which specifies:\r\n\r\n> When using the GET method, clients **must** URL [percent encode](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) all parameters and include them as [query parameter](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) strings...\r\n\r\nThe referenced [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) specifies percent-encoding on page 12.\r\n\r\nTo my understanding, encoding spaces as a `+` in URL query string is more a \"legacy\" thing (for backwards compatibility), whilst percent-encoding is the \"modern\" approach. Would using percent-encoding for `--url-query` actually \"break\" anything?\r\n\r\nSee also:

byte. UriEncode() must enforce the following rules:\r\n\r\n    URI encode every byte except the unreserved characters: 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z', '0'-'9', '-', '.', '_', and '~'.\r\n\r\n    The space character is a reserved character and must be encoded as \"%20\" (and not as \"+\").\r\n\r\n    Each URI encoded byte is formed by a '%' and the two-digit hexadecimal value of the byte.\r\n\r\n    Letters in the hexadecimal value must be uppercase, for example \"%1A\".\r\n\r\n    Encode the forward slash character, '/', everywhere except in the object key name. For example, if the object key name is photos/Jan/sample.jpg, the forward slash in the key name is not encoded. \r\n\r\nImportant\r\n\r\nThe standard UriEncode functions provided by your development platform may not work because \r\nof differences in implementation and related ambiguity in the underlying RFCs. \r\nWe recommend that you write your own custom UriEncode function to ensure that your encoding will work.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo saying \"AWS s3 isn't that standard\" was a little of an overstatement.\r\nThe encoding require by s3 is standard, but doesn't support the whole standard.\r\nThe way curl encode query isn't wrong in any way, but presently doesn't work with V4 signature.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1985406167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"outscale-mgo","id":10047309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDQ3MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10047309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo","html_url":"https://github.com/outscale-mgo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/1985414281","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/13058#issuecomment-1985414281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13058","id":1985414281,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c52VwSJ","user":{"login":"outscale-mgo","id":10047309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDQ3MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10047309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo","html_url":"https://github.com/outscale-mgo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/outscale-mgo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-08T10:10:39Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T10:10:39Z","body":"I'm
