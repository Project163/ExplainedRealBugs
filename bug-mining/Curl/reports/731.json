I did this\n\n- Built curl with ngtcp2, wolfssl, nghttp3, and --enable-ssls-export \n- Made a request to a test HTTP/3 server with SSL sessions\n```\n/curl --http3-only --ssl-sessions my-sessions --tls-earlydata -w 'Early: %{tls_earlydata}\\n' https://127.0.0.1\n```\n- Repeated the request with the SSL session file populated\n\nI then repeated the above with gnutls.\n\nWith wolfssl, a packet capture showed that neither connection used 0-RTT data, although `tls_earlydata` was 0 the first time and 89 the second time.\n\nWith gnutls, the first connection did not use 0-RTT and reported 0 for `tls_earlydata`, the second connection did use 0-RTT and reported 89 for `tls_earlydata`. \n\nFinally, I tried adding the line\n```\nwolfSSL_set_max_early_data(wss->ssl, scs->earlydata_max);\n```\nin `wssl_setup_session()`, and then I did see curl use 0-RTT data on session reuse when built with wolfssl.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI expected curl to send 0-RTT data when re-using SSL session data for an HTTP/3 connection, _or_ to report a value of 0 for `tls_earlydata`.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\ncurl 8.14.1-DEV (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.14.1-DEV wolfSSL/5.8.0 libidn2/2.3.7
