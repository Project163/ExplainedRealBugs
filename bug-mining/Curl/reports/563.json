However, we need to handle sockets ourselves and we use `CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION` callback that manages our sockets. In this callback we call `curl_multi_assign` to keep track of the sockets in our internal structures. The code broke recently because of the way `curl_multi_cleanup` works.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, we need to build cURL with `--enable-debug --enable-curldebug` to have `GOOD_MULTI_HANDLE` check active.\r\n\r\nThe issue is related to recent `cpool` changes but I don't believe it's actual culprit. When `curl_multi_cleanup` is called, it immediately invalidates multi handle magic. However it doesn't take into account that user callbacks can still be called with that multi handle and those callbacks may call `curl_multi_assign` (it is permissible to call this function from a callback).\r\n\r\nThis behavior is forced by a call to `Curl_cpool_destroy` from within `curl_multi_cleanup`. It attempts to shut down all existing connections in the connection pool (the connections without an easy handle attached invisible to the application). Interestingly enough, it later calls socket callback with `CURL_POLL_IN` (and later with `CURL_POLL_REMOVE`).\r\n\r\nI don't have enough introspection as to why cpool is trying to listen on a socket but I believe that until `Curl_cpool_destroy` completes, we should not invalidate multi handle's magic.\r\n\r\nUnless I am missing something, I propose following patch:\r\n```\r\n--- a/lib/multi.c 2024-10-08 07:08:56.000000000 -0600\r\n+++ a/lib/multi.c 2024-10-08 07:09:47.839271207 -0600\r\n@@ -2726,8 +2726,6 @@\r\n     if(multi->in_callback)\r\n       return CURLM_RECURSIVE_API_CALL;\r\n \r\n-    multi->magic = 0; /* not good anymore */\r\n-\r\n     /* move the pending and msgsent entries back to process\r\n        so that there is just one list to iterate over */\r\n     unlink_all_msgsent_handles(multi);\r\n@@ -2761,6 +2759,8 @@\r\n \r\n     Curl_cpool_destroy(&multi->cpool);\r\n \r\n+    multi->magic = 0; /* not good anymore */\r\n+\r\n     sockhash_destroy(&multi->sockhash);\r\n     Curl_hash_destroy(&multi->proto_hash);\r\n     Curl_hash_destroy(&multi->hostcache);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\nI expect that following \"callstack\" would work properly:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl_multi_cleanup()\r\n-- Curl_cpool_destroy()\r\n-- -- _socketaction_callback()\r\n-- -- -- curl_multi_assign() # doesn't assert\r\n```\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\ncurl 8.10.1\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nUbuntu 22, custom cURL build","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15201/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/15201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
