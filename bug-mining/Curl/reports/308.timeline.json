Everything functions properly until the connection with `etcd` is unexpectedly lost. In this case, all current streams hang until the request timeout ends.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this is a bug in `curl` (see https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/11769).\r\n\r\n**Tarantool version**\r\n\r\ntarantool version is `2.11.0-0-g247a9a418`.\r\n\r\n**Operating system**\r\n\r\nUbuntu 22.04.2 LTS.\r\nLinux 6.2.0-26-generic x86-64.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Run etcd (for installation please check [this guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases)).\r\n2. Execute in tarantool:\r\n```\r\nopts = {chunked=true, keepalive_interval = 1, keepalive_idle = 1, verbose = true}\r\nclient = require(\"http.client\").new()\r\nstream = client:post(\"http://localhost:2379/v3/watch\", nil, opts)\r\nstream:read(1, 10000)\r\n```\r\n3. Close etcd server: ```killall -SIGKILL $(pidof etcd)```\r\n4. See that the reproducer hangs.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\ntarantool instance hangs (until the timeout of the read ends).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expected that the request finishes (with an error) due to a lost connection. So the reproducer will finish

I did this\n\n\r\nThere was an issue in Tarantool [^1] due to regression in libcurl (#11769), it was reported on 23 Aug, 2023.

Then it was fixed in #13260 and regression test was added within fix.
