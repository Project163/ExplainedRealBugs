The easy handle is reused between requests to take advantage of the cached connection. Data is attached to the upload via `CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`. However, a `CURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION` is not configured.\n\nTo avoid stalled connections, `CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT` is set:\n```\ncurl_easy_setopt(easy, CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT, 1L);\ncurl_easy_setopt(easy, CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME, 60L);\n```\n\nOccasionally, I'll see the following behavior:\n\n1) (OK) A request succeeds and the connection is cached\n2) (OK) A request fails, as the cached connection is actually closed and the request can't be rewound\n3) (NOT OK) All subsequent requests successfully upload all data, but hit `CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT` before receiving the response\n\nSee [annotated_log.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19851205/annotated_log.txt) for annotated logs from `CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION`.\n\n\n### Suspicion:\n\nI _think_ the behavior in part 3 above occurs because the [`rewind`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/657aae79c04c9440b656c86daf11b38dc553d718/lib/request.h#L129) bit is still set on the request from the previous (failed) request. When [`Curl_init_do`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/657aae79c04c9440b656c86daf11b38dc553d718/lib/url.c#L3833) is called at the start of the request in part 3, it calls `Curl_req_start` -> `Curl_req_soft_reset` -> `Curl_client_start` which will attempt to perform a rewind. This rewind is guaranteed to fail, because I'm using a read function and don't have a seek function.\n\nPopping back to `Curl_init_do`, if `Curl_req_start` fails `Curl_speedinit` will not be called:\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/657aae79c04c9440b656c86daf11b38dc553d718/lib/url.c#L3853-L3858\n\nNone of the call sites of `Curl_init_do` check the result of the function:\n\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/657aae79c04c9440b656c86daf11b38dc553d718/lib/url.c#L3555-L3558\n\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/blob/657aae79c04c9440b656c86daf11b38dc553d718/lib/url.c#L3706-L3714\n\nThis is ultimately what triggers the `CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT` failure on an otherwise successful request. The speed data on request 3 is still the speed data from request 2. Thus, it looks like request 3 has stalled.\n\n### I expected the following\n\nI'd expect `curl_easy_perform` to fail if a required seek fails. IE: The result of `Curl_init_do` should be checked.\n\nI'd expect the `rewind` bit to be reset after the request, but I'm not sure this is a reasonable expectation. For my use, each call to `curl_easy_perform` is a request and rewinding before sending any data has no meaning. I'm not sure if this holds for all use cases.\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\nlibcurl 8.12.1 w/ boringssl\n\n### operating system\n\nmacOS 15.4.1 (24E263)\n\n```\nDarwin <REDACTED> 24.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 24.4.0: Fri Apr 11 18:33:47 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.101.15~117/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000 arm64\n```","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
