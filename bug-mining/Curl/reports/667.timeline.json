There have been a few cookie changes since 8.12.1 (e.g. 5b5e2f7, 1aea05a6, 0064708, 597ee915) so it's possible it points to a libcurl bug or behaviour change; bisecting would make that clear. Also, setting an empty string with `CURLOPT_COOKIELIST` isn't documented to do anything, but maybe pycurl intercepts that and changes it to something else that *does* do something, but this is probably not related to the failure.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2719253630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dfandrich","id":228259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich","html_url":"https://github.com/dfandrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfandrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16721946032,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAiu0c6twsf_zwAAAAPktKWw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/16721946032","actor":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-12T22:26:00Z","label":{"name":"regression","color":"33aa3f"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/2719272494","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/16692#issuecomment-2719272494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/16692","id":2719272494,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAiu0c6iFM4u","user":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-12T22:32:17Z","updated_at":"2025-03-12T22:32:17Z","body":"I think we need more details to understand what's going on.
