Apologies, I missed that you were working with the library directly and not in a CLI environment — since you cited Windows, I know that `curl` is aliased in those systems sometimes so I wanted to be sure you were leveraging the actual `curl`.\r\n\r\n**I think I managed to reproduce the problem you have.**\r\n\r\nI’m on a M1 Mac so I used a Docker container with a `fedora:latest` base image to reproduce this. I also spun up a sftp container to test this containing the file (just some file I had) `BayesMask1.png` in the `/home/` directory.\r\n\r\nThe test script in the Fedora environment:\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\ncurl -V\r\ncurl --limit-rate 1000 --max-time 60 -O -k -u \"sftp:blank\" sftp://10.0.0.5/~/BayesMask1.png\r\necho \"Done.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `--max-time 60` is there because without it, the curl command hung for over fifteen minutes and I wanted to get logs.
