does! It's just that `CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE` is the actual default value, and not `CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS`.\n\n~~There is a minor behavioral difference in that `curl_easy_getinfo(handle, CURLINFO_HTTP_VERSION, &http_version);` would show a different value after setting `CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE` before and after that commit.~~\n**Update:** there doesn't seem to be a difference in the return value for this, since it will reflect the effective HTTP version, not the requested one.\n\nIf that's all OK, a simple documentation update would be enough.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/comments/3183130000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gmta","id":3210731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTA3MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3210731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta","html_url":"https://github.com/gmta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19133532027,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAiu0c7FwLsDzwAAAAR0cod7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/events/19133532027","actor":{"login":"gmta","id":3210731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTA3MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3210731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta","html_url":"https://github.com/gmta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"55956fb65c9503c20372acfc2b307f0538832e41","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gmta/curl/commits/55956fb65c9503c20372acfc2b307f0538832e41","created_at":"2025-08-13T10:19:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"gmta","id":3210731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTA3MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3210731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta","html_url":"https://github.com/gmta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-13T10:19:19Z","updated_at":"2025-08-13T10:19:19Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18273","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18273/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18273/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/18273/events","html_url":"https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/18273","id":3317821146,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAiu0c6jc_gj","number":18273,"title":"docs:
