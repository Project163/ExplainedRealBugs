I did this\r\n\r\nLooking at the man page, in docs/cmdline-opts/create-dirs.d it says:\r\n\r\n> This option creates the directories mentioned with the --output option, nothing else.\r\n\r\nIn docs/cmdline-opts/output-dir.d it says:\r\n\r\n> If the specified target directory does not exist, the operation fails unless--create-dirs is also used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\nA) If in fact the `--create-dirs` option _creates the directories mentioned with the --output option, nothing else_ (_nothing else_, **including** the `--output-dir` option, for example), then for the `--output-dir` option, whether or not the operation fails would not depend on the `--create-dirs` option being used or not.\r\n\r\nor B) If whether or not the operation fails depends on `--create-dir` also being used when the directory specified by `--output-dir` does not exist, then it sounds like the `--create-dirs` option creates directories mentioned in either the `--output` option **_or_** the `--output-dir` option (rather than just the `--output` option and _nothing else_).\r\n\r\nI did not create a PR since 1) I'm not 100% sure which is the correct resolution above, A) or more likely B) and someone more familiar with curl internals would be able to use the correct terminology.\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\ncurl 7.87.0\r\n\r\n###
