I did this\r\n\r\n1. copied [this example](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/2cac6a49b3d8b57d77f08f94b023ced211c70d55/docs/examples/websocket.c) into `foo.c`\r\n2. edited the websocket URL in `foo.c` to be a valid websocket server. `wss://ws.postman-echo.com/raw` works, `ws://localhost:8080` works as well, with [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat) being invoked as `websocat -s 8080`\r\n3. cloned curl master, moved `foo.c` into root folder\r\n4. `cmake -DENABLE_WEBSOCKETS=on`\r\n5. `make`\r\n6. `cc -L lib/ foo.c -lcurl`\r\n7. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/ ./a.out`\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\n\r\nsome kind of ping-pong demo, or a hanging connection, depending on which websocket server is being used.\r\n\r\ninstead the program immediately quits with this after sending the initial HTTP headers:\r\n\r\n```\r\nws: curl_ws_recv returned 81, received 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the real-world application that is built based on that example code, I get (just posting the strerror for searchability):\r\n\r\n```\r\ncode 81: \"Socket not ready for send/recv\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### curl/libcurl version\r\n\r\ngit sha 376cd67035ed2b3cc1504d9ce8e440b1c32099a2\r\n\r\nI thought this was related to #11443, so I checked curl 7 as well. On tag `curl-7_88_1` (046209e56), `foo.c` hangs instead, though `websocket.c` does not exist on that commit at all anyway\r\n\r\n### operating system\r\n\r\nUbuntu 23.10","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/13288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
