However, I have concerns regarding the fix.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, it is essentially what I proposed in my second comment, but I have as yet been unable to confirm that libcurl in any way prevents passing `mbed_send` data *different*  from the last call. In fact, I am fairly sure that when using `CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY`, calling `curl_easy_send` from user code ultimately resolves to a call to `mbed_send`, which suggests that it is entirely up to user code to keep in mind and deal with this pickiness of mbedtls.\r\n\r\nFurther, calling `mbedtls_ssl_write` with 0 bytes of data is allowed and produces a TLS frame, and most likely can also yield `MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_WRITE` (I have seen no indication of the contrary). As far as I can tell, `curl_easy_send` passes such empty ranges of bytes to `mbed_send` without question, so this is also doable from user code. However, the fix uses 0 as a special value to indicate \"not blocked in mbedtls\".\r\n\r\nAre these concerns valid?

In general, having a EAGAIN-like API *that partially commits data* is always problematic.\r\n\r\nI think we need to document in KNOWN BUGS, that a `CURL_EAGAIN` expects the subsequent `curl_easy_send()` to be called with at least the amount of bytes from before.
