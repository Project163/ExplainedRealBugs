could be a `#pragma GCC diagnostic push` without a matching `pop`, but can't\r\nsee any, and those only suppress warnings anyway.\r\n\r\nIt can be a pragma inside a system header, but that seems unlikely.\r\n\r\n145f87b9e89f3a5e287233fe7d3cf57aca23dd8c changed the default for this warning\r\nfrom enable to suppress. But the `no-` option remains guarded with the \"picky warning\" \r\ncondition, meaning it needs `--enable-warnings` or `--enable-debug` to kick in, which\r\naren't set for this job. (Makes me think this option could be deleted from there.)\r\n\r\nIt'd be interesting to find out why this warnings gets enabled in the first place, but\r\nthe simplest and surest fix would be this (I
