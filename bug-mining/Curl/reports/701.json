It seemed like the connection limits were not being respected.\n\nPerforming a git-bisect revealed that the problem was introduced in https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/22d292b3eca1dcbdc590f07e7fe07d1132312a1c\n\nUpon inspecting the change, I observed the following: dohfor_mid is initialized to -1 in Curl_open, however when curl_easy_reset is called, it ends up as 0 when the UserDefined struct in the Curl_easy is memset to 0. Once it is 0, the (data->set.dohfor_mid >= 0) condition in create_conn then becomes true, resulting in the connection limit being overridden. Changing it so that dohfor_mid is instead initialized to -1 in Curl_init_userdefined has resolved the issue for me.\n\n### I expected the following\n\n_No response_\n\n### curl/libcurl version\n\n\\>= curl-8.10.0\n\n### operating system\n\nWindows 10","closed_by":{"login":"bagder","id":177011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder","html_url":"https://github.com/bagder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/17052/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
