  Adding this feature would make curls pinning 100% compatible to HPKP and

+13.12 Reduce CA certificate bundle reparsing
+
+ When using the OpenSSL backend, curl will load and reparse the CA bundle at
+ the creation of the "SSL context" when it sets up a connection to do a TLS
+ handshake. A more effective way would be to somehow cache the CA bundle to
+ avoid it having to be repeatedly reloaded and reparsed.
