 4. Command line
 
+4.1 -T /dev/stdin may upload with an incorrect content length
+
+ -T stats the path to figure out its size in bytes to use it as Content-Length
+ if it is a regular file.
+
+ The problem with that is that, on BSDs and some other UNIXes (not Linux),
+ open(path) may not give you a file descriptor with a 0 offset from the start
+ of the file.

+
+4.2 -T - always uploads chunked
+
+ When the `<` shell operator is used. curl should realise that stdin is a
+ regular file in this case, and that it can do a non-chunked upload, like it
+ would do if you used -T file.
