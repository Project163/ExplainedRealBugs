-# Google Android makefile for curl and libcurl
-#
-# This file can be used when building curl using the full Android source
-# release or the NDK. Most users do not want or need to do this; please
-# instead read the Android section in docs/INSTALL for alternate
-# methods.
-#
-# Place the curl source (including this makefile) into external/curl/ in the
-# Android source tree.  Then build them with 'make curl' or just 'make libcurl'
-# from the Android root. Tested with Android versions 1.5, 2.1-2.3
-#
-# Note: you must first create a curl_config.h file by running configure in the
-# Android environment. The only way I've found to do this is tricky. Perform a
-# normal Android build with libcurl in the source tree, providing the target
-# "showcommands" to make. The build will eventually fail (because curl_config.h
-# doesn't exist yet), but the compiler commands used to build curl will be
-# shown. Now, from the external/curl/ directory, run curl's normal configure
-# command with flags that match what Android itself uses. This will mean
-# putting the compiler directory into the PATH, putting the -I, -isystem and
-# -D options into CPPFLAGS, putting the -W, -m, -f, -O and -nostdlib options
-# into CFLAGS, and putting the -Wl, -L and -l options into LIBS, along with the
-# path to the files libgcc.a, crtbegin_dynamic.o, and ccrtend_android.o.
-# Remember that the paths must be absolute since you will not be running
-# configure from the same directory as the Android make.  The normal
-# cross-compiler options must also be set. Note that the -c, -o, -MD and
-# similar flags must not be set.
-#
-# To see all the LIBS options, you'll need to do the "showcommands" trick on an
-# executable that's already buildable and watch what flags Android uses to link
-# it (dhcpcd is a good choice to watch). You'll also want to add -L options to
-# LIBS that point to the out/.../obj/lib/ and out/.../obj/system/lib/
-# directories so that additional libraries can be found and used by curl.
-#
-# The end result will be a configure command that looks something like this
-# (the environment variable A is set to the Android root path which makes the
-# command shorter):
-#
-#  A=`realpath ../..` && \
-#  PATH="$A/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-X/bin:$PATH" \
-#  ./configure --host=arm-linux CC=arm-eabi-gcc \
-#  CPPFLAGS="-I $A/system/core/include ..." \
-#  CFLAGS="-nostdlib -fno-exceptions -Wno-multichar ..." \
-#  LIBS="$A/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-X/lib/gcc/arm-eabi/X\
-#  /interwork/libgcc.a ..."
-#
-# Finally, copy the file COPYING to NOTICE so that the curl license gets put
-# into the right place (but see the note about this below).

-PACKAGES
-
- This directory and all its subdirectories are for special package
-information, template, scripts and docs. The files herein should be of use for
-those of you who want to package curl in a binary or source format using one
-of those custom formats.
-
- The hierarchy for these directories is something like this:
-
-   packages/[OS]/[FORMAT]/
-
- Currently, we have Win32 and Linux for [OS]. There might be different formats
-for the same OS so for Linux we have RPM as format.
-
- We might need to add some differentiation for CPU as well, as there is
-Linux-RPMs for several CPUs. However, it might not be necessary since the
-packaging should be pretty much the same no matter what CPU that is used.
-
- For each unique OS-FORMAT pair, there's a directory to "fill"! I'd like to
-see a single README with as much details as possible, and then I'd like some
-template files for the package process.
