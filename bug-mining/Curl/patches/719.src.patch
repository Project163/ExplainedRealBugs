+14.1 Retry SOCKS handshake on address type not supported
+
+ When curl resolves a hostname, it might get a mix of IPv6 and IPv4 returned.
+ curl might then use an IPv6 address with a SOCKS5 proxy, which - if it does
+ not support IPv6 - returns "Address type not supported" and curl exits with
+ that error.
+
+ Perhaps it is preferred if curl would in this situation instead first retry
+ the SOCKS handshake again for this case and then use one of the IPv4
+ addresses for the target host.
