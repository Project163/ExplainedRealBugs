 When the write callback (CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3)) is invoked on
 received WebSocket traffic, curl_ws_meta(3) can be called from within
 the callback to provide additional information about the current frame.

-The WebSocket API was introduced as experimental in 7.86.0 and is still

-It is only built-in if explicitly opted in at build time. We discourage use of
