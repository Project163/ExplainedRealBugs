+10.1 --interface with link-scoped IPv6 address
+
+ When you give the `--interface` option telling curl to use a specific
+ interface for its outgoing traffic in combination with a IPv6 address in the
+ URL that uses a link-local scope, curl might pick the wrong address from the
+ named interface and the subsequent transfer fails.
+
+ Example command line:
+
+    curl --interface eth0 'http://[fe80:928d:xxff:fexx:xxxx]/'
+
+ The fact that the given IP address is link-scoped should probably be used as
+ input to somehow make curl make a better choice for this.
