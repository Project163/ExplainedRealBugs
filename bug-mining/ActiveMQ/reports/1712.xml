            <title>[AMQ-4160] DiscoveryNetworkConnector can lose track of active bridges, resulting in permanent bridge failure or continued attempts to re-connect existing bridges</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4160</link>
                <project id="12311210" key="AMQ">ActiveMQ Classic</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Symptom&lt;br/&gt;
=======&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;DiscoveryNetworkConnector&lt;/tt&gt; is not thread-safe, and as a result, race conditions allow the &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt; data structure to become corrupt and not accurately represent the bridges that exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt; is used to control whether a discovery event will result in a bridge creation attempt, if it is not accurate, two results are possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A discovery event will be ignored even though its corresponding bridge is not active; as a result, the bridge will never be established&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A discovery event will be processed even though its corresponding bridge is active; as a result, the bridge creation will fail (because of duplicate connections), and be indefinitely retried, generating many WARN/ERROR log messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cause&lt;br/&gt;
=====&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;DiscoveryNetworkConnector&lt;/tt&gt; updates a &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt; hashmap whenever a bridge is created or removed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeHeader panelHeader&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DiscoveryNetworkConnector.java&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; void onServiceAdd(DiscoveryEvent event) {
...
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// Should we &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; to connect to that URI?
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt; (bridges) {
            &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;( bridges.containsKey(uri) ) {
                &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
                    LOG.debug(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Discovery agent generated a duplicate onServiceAdd event &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;+uri );
                }
                &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;;
            }
        }
...
        NetworkBridge bridge = createBridge(localTransport, remoteTransport, event);
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; {
            bridge.start();
            &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt; (bridges) {
                bridges.put(uri, bridge);
            }
...
}


&lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; void onServiceRemove(DiscoveryEvent event) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; url = event.getServiceName();
    &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (url != &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;) {
        URI uri;
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; {
            uri = &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; URI(url);
        } &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; (URISyntaxException e) {
            LOG.warn(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Could not connect to remote URI: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + url + &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot; due to bad URI syntax: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + e, e);
            &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;;
        }

        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt; (bridges) {
            bridges.remove(uri);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The check-and-set for adding an entry &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt; is not atomic.  As a result, concurrent attempts to add a bridge to the same URL can be allowed to proceed to bridge creation.  Only one of the bridges will be established (the other will fail when it attempts to add duplicate connections); however, the failure of the second bridge will result in a call to &lt;tt&gt;onServiceRemove(...)&lt;/tt&gt; that will remove the single/shared &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt; entry.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The bridge is started before an entry is added to &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt;.  Since bridges are multi-threaded, it is possible that an exception will be handled by a different thread at some time between &lt;tt&gt;bridge.start()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;bridges.put(uri, bridge&lt;/tt&gt;.  In processing this exception, the thread will call &lt;tt&gt;onServiceRemove(...&lt;/tt&gt;, which will remove the (non-existent) &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt; entry.  Subseqently, &lt;tt&gt;bridges.put(uri, bridge)&lt;/tt&gt; is executed, and adds the entry to &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt; even though it is now stale and represents a failed bridge.  Subsequent attempts to restore the bridge will be ignored, and no active bridge will be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The lack of thread-safety in &lt;tt&gt;DiscoveryNetworkConnector&lt;/tt&gt; is exacerbated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4159&quot; title=&quot;Race condition in SimpleDiscoveryAgent creates multiple concurrent threads attempting to connect to the same bridge --- can result in deadlock&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;AMQ-4159&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;AMQ-4159&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can result in many concurrent attempts to establish a bridge to the same URL.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4159&quot; title=&quot;Race condition in SimpleDiscoveryAgent creates multiple concurrent threads attempting to connect to the same bridge --- can result in deadlock&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;AMQ-4159&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;AMQ-4159&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also described how multiple calls can be made to &lt;tt&gt;onServiceRemove(...)&lt;/tt&gt;, which can result in mal-behaviour similar to the second case described above (i.e., unexpected removal of a bridge that is active).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution&lt;br/&gt;
========&lt;br/&gt;
The attached patch attempts to restore some thread-safety to &lt;tt&gt;DiscoveryNetworkConnector&lt;/tt&gt; by making the check-and-set atomic and adding the entry to &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt; prior to starting the bridge.  An additional structure, &lt;tt&gt;activeEvents&lt;/tt&gt;, keeps track of the event that represents the current attempt to establish a bridge to a given remote URL &amp;#8212; this is used to prevent multiple calls to &lt;tt&gt;onServiceRemove(...)&lt;/tt&gt; from removing a &lt;tt&gt;bridges&lt;/tt&gt; entry that was &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; added by the corresponding discovery event.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch is a band aid to the design flaws in &lt;tt&gt;DiscoveryNetworkConnector&lt;/tt&gt;, and a refactoring of the connector should be considered.  In particular, there is a tight-coupling between &lt;tt&gt;DiscoveryNetworkConnector&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;SimpleDiscoveryAgent&lt;/tt&gt; that is not evident through their interfaces.  For example, &lt;tt&gt;DiscoveryNetworkConnector&lt;/tt&gt; assumes that the call to &lt;tt&gt;discoveryAgent.serviceFailed(...)&lt;/tt&gt; will result in a call back to &lt;tt&gt;DiscoveryNetworkConnector.onServiceRemove(...)&lt;/tt&gt;.  The call to &lt;tt&gt;onServiceRemove(...)&lt;/tt&gt; is necessary to clean up the resources used by the bridge, but that requirement is not explicit, and therefore easily missed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the fast turnaround, Timothy. I linked &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4159&quot; title=&quot;Race condition in SimpleDiscoveryAgent creates multiple concurrent threads attempting to connect to the same bridge --- can result in deadlock&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;AMQ-4159&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;AMQ-4159&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4160&quot; title=&quot;DiscoveryNetworkConnector can lose track of active bridges, resulting in permanent bridge failure or continued attempts to re-connect existing bridges&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;AMQ-4160&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;AMQ-4160&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; together as they are related (at least the symptoms were observed during the same test that we were running). Now that I think about it, the fix for &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4160&quot; title=&quot;DiscoveryNetworkConnector can lose track of active bridges, resulting in permanent bridge failure or continued attempts to re-connect existing bridges&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;AMQ-4160&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;AMQ-4160&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; relies on &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4159&quot; title=&quot;Race condition in SimpleDiscoveryAgent creates multiple concurrent threads attempting to connect to the same bridge --- can result in deadlock&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;AMQ-4159&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;AMQ-4159&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., one-to-one relationship between DiscoveryEvent and a bridge creation attempt). It would be great if &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4160&quot; title=&quot;DiscoveryNetworkConnector can lose track of active bridges, resulting in permanent bridge failure or continued attempts to re-connect existing bridges&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;AMQ-4160&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;AMQ-4160&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could also be fixed for AMQ 5.8.0.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13490892" author="tabish121" created="Mon, 5 Nov 2012 20:22:47 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Needed to confirm that this didn&apos;t break any tests and there&apos;s currently some instability in some of the network tests.  Looks good, nice work.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13492540" author="stirlingc" created="Wed, 7 Nov 2012 17:53:03 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Reopening as I&apos;ve found two problems with the patch as applied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+            // Should we try to connect to that URI?&lt;br/&gt;
+            if (activeEvents.putIfAbsent(uri, event) != null) &lt;/p&gt;
{
+                LOG.debug(&quot;Discovery agent generated a duplicate onServiceAdd event for: &quot;+uri );
+            }

&lt;p&gt;---&amp;gt; there should be a &quot;return&quot; statement after the LOG.debug&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+            // Only remove bridge if this is the active discovery event for the URL.&lt;br/&gt;
+            if (activeEvents.remove(url, event)) {&lt;br/&gt;
+                synchronized (bridges) &lt;/p&gt;
{
+                    bridges.remove(uri);
+                }

&lt;p&gt;---&amp;gt; the activeEvents.remove(url, event)) should be activeEvents.remove(uri, event) (i.e., uri instead of url)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existing AMQ4160Test.java will not pass with these updates since it demonstrates the original bug, which was based on concurrent attempts being allowed to occur.  The original patch was still allowing concurrent attempts.  With these updated changes, concurrent attempts are disallowed so AMQ4160Test.java will fail &amp;#8212; I&apos;ll have to provide an updated unit test to account for this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;The updated patch contains the following changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unit test updated to include verification of handleStop&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unit test updated to allow inclusion of the previously removed test; now verifies pre and post patch&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Improved waitForBridge/hasBridge methods added to JmsMultipleBrokersTestSupport &amp;#8212; the existing waitForBridgeFormation methods are based on NetworkConnector.bridges, which is updated prior to connections (and thus the bridge) actually being formed &amp;#8212; the new waitForBridge method waits for broker info to be exchange before declaring that a bridge has foremd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
