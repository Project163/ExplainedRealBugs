Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nWindows Server 2022\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.1.0-vmware\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\nOur baseline is 7e086c215c3cbaea66a1b795c5393311fea74bd6.\n```\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/12a3fc001b6629b52f5b24dce6018884222a0608\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nEnclosing `-XX:+UseAllWindowsProcessorGroups` in `-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions` and `-XX:-IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions` doesn't appear to work as intended w/ BellSoft Liberica OpenJDK 21.0.4. It looks like `IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions` is processed out of band such that the `-XX:+Ignore...` is immediately negated by `-XX:-Ignore...`. (I only skimmed, but IIUC, the JVM launcher takes a separate pass over argv to look for `IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions` and toggle a flag variable.)\n\nhttps://github.com/openjdk/jdk21u/blob/master/src/hotspot/share/runtime/arguments.cpp#L3620-L3692","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
