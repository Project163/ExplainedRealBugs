issue tracks the progress towards [Remote Builds without the

for not downloading intermediate artifacts** (In Bazel 0.25)\r\nThe feature can be enabled by adding the flag `--experimental_remote_download_outputs=minimal` to the remote caching / execution invocation. The feature mostly works, but comes with the limitations stated in the subsequent tasks.\r\n- [x] **Fix local actions that need to fetch remote outputs** (In Bazel 0.25)\r\nWhile Bazel can run most actions remotely there are a few dozen or so action implementations that currently can't. This can be problematic because such actions often require Bazel to download remote files which this change tries to avoid. An example of such an action is the `SymlinkAction`.\r\n- [x] **Implement fetching of top level artifacts** (In Bazel 0.26)\r\nImplement `--experimental_remote_download_outputs=toplevel` as described in the design document.\r\n- [x] **Support downloading unzipped undeclared test outputs**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17884 for details\r\n- [x] **Store per output file metadata in the persistent action cache**\r\nThe persistent action cache stores the state of Bazel's output base. It does not know about remotely stored files. We need to extend it to do so. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8248\r\n- [x] **Builds without the Bytes fails on missing AC result**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10880 for details\r\n- [x] **Support remote cache eviction**\r\nAs detailed in the design document it's possible for Bazel to wrongly think that an output file exists on the remote system because it has been evicted (\"garbage collected\") in the meantime. If a Bazel action then depends on an evicted file there is currently no other way but to fail the build/test. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8250\r\n- [x] **Add up- and download stats to the profiler**\r\nA user should have insight into what is being up/downloaded and why.\r\n- [x] **Be compatible with the Build Event Service local file uploader** (In Bazel 0.28.0)\r\nThis change currently doesn't interact well with the BEP and BES. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8249\r\n- [x] **Don't create a runfiles tree for remote actions**\r\nFor a test that runs remotely we currently create a runfiles tree in the output base with dangling symlinks that's unused. We need to fix the `SymlinkTreeStrategy`.\r\n- [x] Download targets of symlinks in runfiles\r\nSee #18249 for details\r\n- [x] **Support symlinks into tree artifacts**\r\nSee #15678 for details\r\n- [x] **ctx.actions.symlink actions are not constant time**\r\nSee #14125 for details\r\n- [x] **Support unresolved symlinks in action outputs**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13355 for details\r\n- [x] **Do not create runfile trees unnecessarily when building without the bytes**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18580 for details\r\n- [x] **Bazel query silently thrashes the analysis cache when --remote_download_minimal is enabled**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10902 for details\r\n- [x] **Build event file creation fails with symlinks when using --remote_download_minimal**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11942 for details\r\n- [x] Support for mobile-install command\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14523 for details\r\n- [x] **Work seamlessly with IDEs**\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/1922
