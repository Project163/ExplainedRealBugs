Description of the bug:\n\n\nThis bug continues the discussion from https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22688, and the fruitful conversation we had in the associated PR: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22689#issuecomment-2161116562\nContext: Without that PR, my team was observing bazel crashing spuriously on Windows after converting our `rules_rust` usage from WORKSPACE files to bzlmod.\n\nThanks to bazelisk (it's amazing!), we were able to pull in a pre-release build of bazel's 7.2.1 branch.\nInstead of the aforementioned crash we're now getting the (occasional) error\n\n```\nERROR: Analysis of target '@@codeql~//ruby:ruby-generic-zip' failed; build aborted: Failed to clean up module context directory: C:/tmp/modextwd/rules_rust~~crate (Directory not empty)\n```\nduring our build.\n\nIs this a bazel bug or a `rules_rust` bug?\n\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nExternal Dependency\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nI'm not sure. The relevant build target that pulls `rules_rust` into the target '@@codeql~//ruby:ruby-generic-zip' is defined [here](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/ruby/extractor/BUILD.bazel#L5), but that repository is built in the context of an internal repository, and there's a few dependencies to the target that aren't open-sourced, so the repo doesn't build without modifications standalone.\n\nIf there's a need for a reproducer, then I can try hacking/reducing our internal dependencies in a branch and writing an Actions workflow that runs bazel in a loop until it errors out with this.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nWindows Server 2019 (GitHub actions)\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\ndevelopment version\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\nBazelisk to pull in 76286491d0bacaf790ea8e6fa76ae5bdf6dd3db2\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nWe're using `rules_rust` `crate_universe` mechanism to pull in external dependencies from [`Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/ruby/extractor/Cargo.toml) into bazel. As might be more uncommon, we do have 3 dependencies we pull in as git repositories, instead of as regular downloads from crate.io, which takes a longer time (and might create more files on disk/more IO).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
