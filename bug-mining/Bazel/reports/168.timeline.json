Description of the bug:\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter upgrade from bazel 7.0.2 to bazel 7.1.1 seeing an issue where bazel analysis cache is lost between invocations and \"Analyzing: target\"/\"checking cached actions\"/fetching external repositories run on each invocation vs being retained in-memory. Server pid doesnt check and there are no logs like `WARNING: something something has changed, discarding analysis cache (this can be expensive, see https://bazel.build/advanced/performance/iteration-speed)` \r\n\r\nReverting https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/18ba4492c752530b168daa563987400f7f9df4bb and related https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/bd4bddf6a9359b363dc60a83b8da7083e738c202 solves this issue\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\n7.1.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/18ba4492c752530b168daa563987400f7f9df4b\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\nLogs from running same build command several times in a row\r\n\r\nExpected (7.0.2 behavior)\r\n```\r\nINFO: Invocation ID:
