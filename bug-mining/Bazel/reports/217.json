Furthermore, the syntax in the presence of bzlmod is very unintuitive!\r\n\r\nIn the WORKSPACE world, the natural syntax (simply copy-pasted from CLI invocations) worked fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nflags = [\r\n    \"--@upstream//:label_flag=@upstream//:alt\",\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith bzlmod enabled, this produces an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: no such package '@@upstream//': The repository '@@upstream' could not be resolved: Repository '@@upstream' is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, one has to write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nflags = [\r\n    \"--@@upstream~//:label_flag=@@upstream~//:alt\",\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\nBesides looking a bit weird, I worry that this depends on some private implementation details of bzlmod.\r\n\r\nIs there a nicer syntax, or some function I could pass `@upstream//:alt` to in order to obtain the correct string? (Some BUILD file equivalent of `str(Label(...))`, I suppose?)\r\n\r\n@katre @Wyverald \r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\nConfigurability, External Dependency\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
