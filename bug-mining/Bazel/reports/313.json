I'm requesting that git_override (in bzlmod) be expanded to add a sparse-checkout option. This could be done relatively easy with a custom repository rule back with Workspace, but now with bzlmod I'm hoping to not have to use a module extension to achieve this.\r\nhttps://bazel.build/rules/lib/globals/module#git_override\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nExternal Dependency\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nI am dealing with a very large repository, and using the current git_override rule is not feasible.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nn/a\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nn/a\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\nn/a\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\nn/a\n```\n\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nI found https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13747 that requests a similar feature for git_repository.\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nI don't believe this would be too difficult. The additional inputs would be a list of repository paths to checkout (passed down to git). We would also have to enforce the system's git is a minimum version. I'd be happy to take a stab at it myself if someone could confirm this as a valuable addition and point me to the code to modify.","closed_by":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
