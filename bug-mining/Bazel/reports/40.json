Valid values are: [processwrapper-sandbox, standalone, remote, worker, sandboxed, local]\r\n```\r\nIt seems that recently a 1s timeout was introduced in checking if `linux-sandbox` available #15414, which might be too tight under load.\r\n\r\nIn our setup, we disable all other weaker sandboxes for hermeticity, which makes this fail reliably and easy to notice. I suspect this is happening on more environments, but people haven't noticed because of`processwrapper-sandbox` fallback.\r\n\r\nCC @meisterT \r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
