passed, the above command succeeds.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nRunning with `--sandbox_debug` and poking around the failing actions execroot reveals that unlike #20515 the file in question here *is* a symlink into the sandbox-execroot directory (as it should be):\r\n```console\r\n❯ ls

the `sandbox` invocation from `--sandbox_debug`) we arrive, once again, at symlink to a host-execroot path:\r\n```shell\r\n/tmp/bazel-rrbutani/install/89a68939cbf63eb54205fdf943a58b15/linux-sandbox

(`bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/external/protobuf~21.7/_virtual_imports/any_proto/google/protobuf/any.proto`) in the execroot (note: the actual execroot under the output base, not the action's execroot)

generating `bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/external/protobuf~21.7/_virtual_imports/any_proto/google/protobuf/any.proto`:\r\n```\r\naction 'Symlinking virtual .proto sources for @@protobuf~21.7//:any_proto'\r\n  Mnemonic: Symlink\r\n  Target: @com_google_protobuf//:any_proto\r\n  Configuration: k8-fastbuild\r\n  Execution platform: //:default_host_platform\r\n  ActionKey:

[bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/external/protobuf~21.7/_virtual_imports/any_proto/google/protobuf/any.proto]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis then leads back to `proto_library`'s starlark implementation function (via [`_process_srcs`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/c51991600c73b9b488b08c8b68d156bce008b064/src/main/starlark/builtins_bzl/common/proto/proto_library.bzl#L105))\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/c51991600c73b9b488b08c8b68d156bce008b064/src/main/starlark/builtins_bzl/common/proto/proto_library.bzl#L137-L153\r\n\r\n... which in turn leads to `SymlinkAction` (via [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/ebe4d0dac36b2211f1fb38838d79c78064a66ebe/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/starlark/StarlarkActionFactory.java#L280-L289)) which appears to always create symlinks that have absolute path destinations (IIUC):\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/cde4b7bc718f1a3e1515bdc135dff43bae5c8f6f/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/actions/SymlinkAction.java#L189-L222\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sure how to go about solving this in a way that's not likely to cause other breakage. As best as I can tell actions are *not* keyed on `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`; having `ctx.actions.symlink` behave differently based on this option seems fraught. If relative symlink destinations are not viable, perhaps we can rewrite these symlinks during sandbox spawn setup? (i.e. instead of making a symlink within the action's execroot that points to the symlink within the execroot, just have the action-execroot symlink point to the destination, adjusted to be sandbox-execroot-relative).\r\n\r\nNote: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14224 is somewhat related to this though this specific case (`proto_library`) involves an invocation of `ctx.actions.symlink(...)` with `target_file` instead of `target_path`.\r\n\r\n[^1]: in #20515, many of the actions were already in my disk cache (with results produced by a previous invocation with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` disabled); this masked other errors like this one","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20518/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1853944014","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20515#issuecomment-1853944014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20515","id":1853944014,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5ugPDO","user":{"login":"lberki","id":3524818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjQ4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3524818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki","html_url":"https://github.com/lberki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-13T13:43:25Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T13:43:25Z","body":"Woah, that was a very detailed report, thanks for investing the time and energy into it :) It helped me to zero in on the problem:\r\n\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this.
