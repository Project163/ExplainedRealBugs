For example:\r\n\r\nmy_repo_rule.bzl\r\n```\r\ndef _impl(repository_ctx):\r\n    repository_ctx.download(\r\n        url = repository_ctx.attr.url,\r\n        output = \"myfile\",\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    repository_ctx.file(\"WORKSPACE\", \"\")\r\n    repository_ctx.file(\"BUILD\", \"\"\"exports_files(glob([\"**\"]))\"\"\")\r\n\r\nmy_repo_rule = repository_rule(\r\n    implementation = _impl,\r\n    attrs = {\"url\": attr.string()}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWORKSPACE\r\n```\r\nload(\":my_repo_rule.bzl\", \"my_repo_rule\")\r\n\r\nmy_repo_rule(\r\n    name = \"chrome_deb\",\r\n    url = \"https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nmy_repo_rule(\r\n    name = \"chrome_rpm\",\r\n    url = \"https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.rpm\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when there are a lot of files, this approach requires creating a lot of repositories.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of downloading in parallel is:\r\n\r\n- If there are a lot of small files to download, the time savings are big, because most of the time spent on setting up the connection is parallelized. If there are a few big files to download, the time savings are small.\r\n- I could also do something like the following with good parallelization (pseudocode):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef _impl(repository_ctx):\r\n    repository_ctx.download(<metadata file>)\r\n    metadata = repository_ctx.read(<metadata file>)\r\n    repository_ctx.download_multiple(metadata.urls)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the API to download multiple files, the above can only be done in WORKSPACE only.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# WORKSPACE\r\nload(\":download.bzl\", \"download_metadata\", \"download\")\r\ndownload_metadata(name = \"metadata\")\r\n\r\nload(\"@metadata//:metadata.bzl\", \"metadata\")\r\n[\r\n  download(name = elem.name, url = elem.url)\r\n  for elem in meatadata\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't hide all these in a single macro because the load statements interleave with the repository definitions.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.3.2\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nhttps://bazel.build/rules/lib/builtins/repository_ctx#download\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
