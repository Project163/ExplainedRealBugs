Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nHere's a small repro:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\n# MODULE.bazel\r\n\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"mydep\")\r\narchive_override(\r\n  module_name = \"mydep\",\r\n  urls = [\"invalid\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bazel build ...\r\nINFO: Repository mydep~ instantiated at:\r\n  <builtin>: in <toplevel>\r\nRepository rule http_archive defined at:\r\n  /Users/laurent/output_base/external/bazel_tools/tools/build_defs/repo/http.bzl:397:31: in <toplevel>\r\nERROR: An error occurred during the fetch of repository 'mydep~':\r\n   Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n\tFile \"/Users/laurent/output_base/external/bazel_tools/tools/build_defs/repo/http.bzl\", line 142, column 45, in _http_archive_impl\r\n\t\tdownload_info = ctx.download_and_extract(\r\nError in download_and_extract: java.io.IOException: Bad URL: invalid\r\nERROR: <builtin>: fetching http_archive rule //:mydep~: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n\tFile \"/Users/laurent/output_base/external/bazel_tools/tools/build_defs/repo/http.bzl\", line 142, column 45, in _http_archive_impl\r\n\t\tdownload_info = ctx.download_and_extract(\r\nError in download_and_extract: java.io.IOException: Bad URL: invalid\r\nERROR: Error computing the main repository mapping: error during computation of main repo mapping: java.io.IOException: Bad URL: invalid\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the Starlark stacktrace appears twice.

If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
