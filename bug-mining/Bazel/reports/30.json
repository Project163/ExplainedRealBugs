This directory contains files that are not a function of the input attributes, for example `.git/logs` contains files that contain timestamps of when the remote branch was fetched.\r\n\r\nThis causes a real issue in rules_rust (https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust/issues/1927), since it generates targets that glob the entire external repository.\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a git_repository repository rule, inspect the `.git/logs` directory and see that it contains timestamps.\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nUbuntu 22.04\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 6.1.0\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18152/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
