#20086.\n\nAs described in the issue, this PR adds read-only permissions to bazel's workflows that don't yet have them. This reduces the risk of supply-chain attacks via the project's CI/CD infrastructure.\n\nMy understanding is that `cherry-picker.yml` does not require any additional permissions since everything done by `bazelbuild/continuous-integration/actions/cherry_picker` uses the declared `GH_TOKEN` instead of the workflow's default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. If I'm mistaken, let me know and I'll happy fix the PR.\n\nCloses #20087.\n\nCommit https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ba61ff7d2eb6ed697e12abe3688992e85c434b30\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 580542813\nChange-Id: Ib45164ea8d9c0aa583e91d316ad2b552f3c9b5b7","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10903551847,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc52I8-RzwAAAAKJ5v9n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10903551847","actor":{"login":"keertk","id":110264242,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpJ_sg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110264242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk","html_url":"https://github.com/keertk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f5d4283825a986d5515c7cf58fada172d148e4da","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/f5d4283825a986d5515c7cf58fada172d148e4da","created_at":"2023-11-08T17:00:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1836618916","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20086#issuecomment-1836618916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20086","id":1836618916,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5teJSk","user":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-01T18:55:22Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T18:55:22Z","body":"A fix for this issue has been included in [Bazel 7.0.0 RC5](https://releases.bazel.build/7.0.0/rc5/index.html).
