Description of the feature request:\n\n\nOne of the principles of module extensions is that each module has its own \"repository namespace\". This tends to result in the hub-and-spoke model, where we generate a hub for each module. However, this falls apart when you have multiple modules that define the same repo using the same module extension (which is relatively common). Consider:\r\n\r\n```\r\nworkspace/Cargo.toml\r\nsame_dep = { version = \"1.2.3\" }\r\ndifferent_version = { version = \"1.2.3\"}\r\ndifferent_config = { version = \"1.2.3\", features = [\"blah\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nworkspace/MODULE.bazel\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"my-dep\")\r\n...\r\nrust_crates.crates_repository(repo_name = \"crates\", manifests=[\":Cargo.toml\"], lockfile=\":Cargo.lock\"))```\r\nuse_repo(rust_crates, \"crates\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy_dep/Cargo.toml\r\nsame_dep = { version = \"1.2.3\" }\r\ndifferent_version = { version = \"2.3.4\"}\r\ndifferent_config = { version = \"1.2.3\", features = []}\r\nimplicit_dep = { version = \"1.2.3\", features = [\"blah\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy_dep/MODULE.bazel\r\nrust_crates.crates_repository(repo_name = \"crates\", manifests=[\":Cargo.toml\"], lockfile=\":Cargo.lock\"))\r\nuse_repo(rust_crates, \"crates\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor an example such as above, the ideal semantics would be to generate repositories like the following:\r\n* `same_dep_123_sources`, `different_version_123_sources`, `different_version_234_config`, `different_config_123_sources`, `implicit_dep_123_sources` (private repos, cannot be use_repo'd)\r\n* `same_dep_123_config1`, `different_version_123_config1`, `different_version_234_config1`, `different_config_123_config1`, `different_config_123_config2`, `implicit_dep_123_config1` (private repos, cannot be use_repo'd)\r\n* `workspace_crates` (visible as `crates` to workspace), invisible to my_dep\r\n* `my_dep_crates` (visible as `crates` to my_dep), invisible to workspace\r\n\r\nIn terms of implementation details, my idea of the top of my head was something along the lines of:\r\n```\r\nfor mod in module_ctx.modules:\r\n  repository_rule(name = \"hub_repo_%s\" % mod, repo_mapping = {mod: \"crates\"}, ...)\r\nfor spoke in spokes:\r\n  other_repository_rule(name = spoke.name, repo_mapping = {}) # make repo invisible.\r\n```\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nIn the example above, there are a few different things where we could go wrong:\r\n\r\n* Implicit dependencies\r\n  * If I remove same-dep from cargo.toml in the workspace, my `deps = [\"@crates//:same_dep\"]` will still compile\r\n  * Conversely, I can add `deps = [\"@crates//:implicit_dep\"]`, and if they remove implicit_dep in a future update to their module, my code will fail to compile.\r\n* Unintended access to implementation details\r\n  * I can write `use_repo(rust_crates, \"crates_same_dep_sources\")` to access something that might be changed in future versions. This makes public vs private API unclear.\r\n* Impossible semantics\r\n  * In the different config & different version examples, there is no way that I can provide `@crates//:different_config`, as they need to refer to different things, but can't.\r\n* If my_dep adds the use_repo line, when I update my module may break.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.0.0-pre.20221012.2\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nNo\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nNo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9036269486,"node_id":"CE_lADOATz7jc5iDY8GzwAAAAIamoeu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/9036269486","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"6a47481ca48415515a51c701864c244f08da1c0d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/6a47481ca48415515a51c701864c244f08da1c0d","created_at":"2023-04-18T13:56:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-18T21:58:43Z","updated_at":"2023-04-18T21:58:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/issues/1511","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/issues/1511/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/issues/1511/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/issues/1511/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle/pull/1511","id":1673883858,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBrb7Vc5Ono-j","number":1511,"title":"bzlmod:

🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Rules\r\n`py_library` / `py_binary`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIf there is a python library `@foo//bar:baz`, how can I import it from the main repository?\r\n\r\nPre-bzlmod, you could write `from foo.bar import baz`, as it would be in the directory `external/foo/bar/baz`, and the external directory was in your python path. Apparently this was not documented or intended, but nevertheless, people used it, as I don't believe it was ever considered when writing rules_python.\r\n\r\nIn bzlmod, however, you have repo mapping, where the directory `foo` is actually stored at `external/_main~~foo_ext~foo`, and thus `from foo.bar import baz` fails. This is the direct cause of #1679, and if we solve this, we fix that bug for free.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd personally like to make users prefix their imports to external repositories with the name of the workspace (based on the repo mapping). This would allow two python files in different repositories to `import foo.bar.baz` and each get their own `@foo` in the case of a repo name clash (this is how repo mapping is intended to be used, to allow each repo to have their own namespace of repos).\r\n\r\nI previously achieved this in ChromeOS via a `sitecustomize.py` (see discussion in #1679).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI can't really think of a viable alternative. Any solution without including the repo name in the import seems like it will end up in painful corner cases where you have name conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_python/issues/2088/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_python/issues/2088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
