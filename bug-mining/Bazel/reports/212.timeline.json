As a result, all commands in config expansions behave like `common`.\r\n\r\nThe most straightforward fix I can think of is to annotate each individual arg with the `fallbackData` that applies to it in arguments to the `parse` functions in `OptionsParser`. I initially tried to make very changes and just run the `parse` function for each `common` or non-`common` run of args, but that resulted in issues with option priorities that I ultimately couldn't resolve since `OptionsParserImplResult`s can't easily be merged.\r\n\r\nI now think that the main `parse` function has to be modified to accept something like `List<Pair<OptionsData, List<String>>` as `args`. @justinhorvitz What do you think about that?
