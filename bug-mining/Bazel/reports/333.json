This is unexpected because the source code and environment remain unchanged since previous build.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nRemote Execution\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nI'm using the `//src/main/cpp:client` target from `bazelbuild/bazel` as an example.\nFirst, perform full rebuild to ensure that all actions are in remote cache:\n```\nbazel clean\nbazel build //src/main/cpp:client --remote_cache=http://127.0.0.1:12345/\n\nINFO: Elapsed time: 241.181s, Critical Path: 29.06s\nINFO: 1531 processes: 253 internal, 1278 local.\nINFO: Build completed successfully, 1531 total actions\n```\n\nRebuild the target with remote cache and TTL=5 min:\n```\nbazel clean\nbazel build //src/main/cpp:client --remote_cache=http://127.0.0.1:12345/ --experimental_remote_cache_ttl=5m\n\nINFO: Elapsed time: 6.717s, Critical Path: 2.87s\nINFO: 1545 processes: 1276 remote cache hit, 267 internal, 2 local.\nINFO: Build completed successfully, 1545 total actions\n```\n\nWait 5 min.\nRebuild the target once again:\n```\nbazel build //src/main/cpp:client --remote_cache=http://127.0.0.1:12345/ --experimental_remote_cache_ttl=5m\n```\n\nExpected result:\n```\nTarget //src/main/cpp:client up-to-date:\n  bazel-bin/src/main/cpp/client.exe\n```\n\nActual result:\n```\nINFO: Elapsed time: 2.980s, Critical Path: 0.36s\nINFO: 1277 processes: 1276 remote cache hit, 1 internal.\nINFO: Build completed successfully, 1277 total actions\n```\n\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nWindows\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 7.6.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nThe similar issue was discussed in [Unusual Builds with Bytes | BuildBuddy](https://www.buildbuddy.io/blog/unusual-builds-w-bytes/)\nand fixed in [Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires by fmeum · Pull Request #25398 · bazelbuild/bazel · GitHub](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25398), included into release 7.5.0.\nHowever, it seems that this fix resolves the issue for downloading itself, not for invalidating the action.\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
