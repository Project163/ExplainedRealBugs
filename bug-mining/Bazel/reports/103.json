Once again, sorry for not following the template, this didn't really fit in one...\r\n\r\nBazel already hash-pins it's GitHub Actions (done in #18264), which is great. However, hashes are hard to update manually, so we could use dependabot to do this work automatically.\r\n\r\nWe can set up dependabot to send a single periodic PR to update all the hashes. This will help keep bazel's CI up-to-date.\r\n\r\nIf you'd rather keep the Actions fixed at these trusted versions, I'd suggest enabling Dependabot security updates (if you haven't already – that information isn't visible from outside). These are PRs sent by Dependabot whenever a vulnerability is reported on a dependency. This will ensure that, should a vulnerability be discovered in the hash-pinned version of an Action, Bazel will immediately receive a PR to migrate to a patched version. To enable security updates:\r\n\r\n1. Settings > [Code security & analysis](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/settings/security_analysis)\r\n2. Enable \"Dependabot security updates\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'll send a PR adding dependabot so you can take a look.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20180/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
