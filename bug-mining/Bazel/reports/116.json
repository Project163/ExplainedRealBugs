This works as expected in Bazel 6 however, in Bazel 7, this functionality does not work as expected. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\n\r\nCore\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. This is a modified version of the official bazel examples.\r\n[JobsRepro.zip](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/files/13657549/JobsRepro.zip)\r\n2. With bazel 7,\r\n```\r\nbuild :hello-time :hello-time1 :hello-time2 :hello-time3 :hello-time4\r\n```\r\neven though jobs=1 is specified in the .bazelrc, we still see parallel jobs > 1. \r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 12 57 12 PM](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/assets/11925399/29d17aee-648a-4c1d-a4a2-d46a99208fc1)\r\n3. But the same example, with Bazel 6.4, respects --jobs=1.\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 12 58 43 PM](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/assets/11925399/96953f59-1ff7-4048-a183-78e3a0ff5d89)\r\n\r\n4. With Bazel 7, if I use `--local_cpu_resources=1`, then it seems to work as expected. But from the documentation, --jobs is a global override to control such parallelism, wondering if this is a regression or if this behavior is driven differently in Bazel 7 intentionally. \r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\n7.0.0\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?
