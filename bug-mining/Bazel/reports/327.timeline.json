Description of the feature request:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed in [this Slack

`bzlmod` extension evaluation.\r\n\r\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to store URL, sha256 values that I can fetch from the PyPI index. That is something that is a by product of the extension evaluation and I would like to reuse that in future evaluations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, my intention would be to use this in `rules_python` when we download these facts available through PyPI server:\r\n1. e.g. Distribution `a` for version `b` has artifacts downloadable at `X` with hash `Y`.\r\n2. Artifacts downloadable at `X` have further METADATA files associated with other hashes.\r\n\r\nI would like to mark the extension as reproducible so that only the facts are persisted in the `MODULE.bazel.lock` file. For my usecase arch/os dependent facts are not
