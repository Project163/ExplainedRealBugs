We recently fixed issues with bazel run that sound similar.\r\n\r\nI do not currently have an environment set up where I can build the latest head, but I have tentatively tested the following:\r\n1. Create a script with `bazel run :foo --script_path=foo_script.sh` -- this was done with release `7.0.0-pre.20230302.1`\r\n2. Replace the path to `test-setup.sh` on the last line of the generated script with a path to the `test-setup.sh` in the source repository of head (dbb09c9ea84cc6099ad7a30fa8206130d025f7ad)\r\n3. Run the same command as in the original issue, i.e. `while ./foo_script.sh 2> /dev/null | grep \"useful echo\" > /dev/null ; do echo -n \".\" ; done && echo \"Failed to grep 'useful echo'\"`\r\n\r\nThis still fails as described in the issue. While `foo_script.sh` was not built with a Bazel built from head, it does use the `test-setup.sh` found on head, which I reckon is where the problem is. I can try to investigate this further once I have an environment where I can build Bazel from head set

#17754.\r\n\r\nWhat we have seen prior to this change was that sometimes for quick tests the output was swallowed. After a lot of poking it became clear that the culprit is the use of subshell and `tee`, e.g. if you remove `tee` completely from the picture the behavior never shows up.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that with a fast test, `tee` seems to be killed (or its parent subshell) before the printing the output to stdout.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we reduce the number of subshells and processes to set up and reduce the chance of the race condition but not remove it.\r\n\r\nHowever, for practical purposes, the race condition is gone.\r\n\r\nWith the reproduction steps in #17754, and this command\r\n```\r\nfor i in {1..10000}; do /tmp/bazel run :foo &> /tmp/log ; grep -q \"useful echo\" /tmp/log ; if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo -n '+'; else  echo -n '-'; fi; done\r\n```\r\na bazel from head fails ~3900 out of 10000 times.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, it never

#17754.\r\n\r\nWhat we have seen prior to this change was that sometimes for quick tests the output was swallowed. After a lot of poking it became clear that the culprit is the use of subshell and `tee`, e.g. if you remove `tee` completely from the picture the behavior never shows up.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that with a fast test, `tee` seems to be killed (or its parent subshell) before the printing the output to stdout.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we reduce the number of subshells and processes to set up and reduce the chance of the race condition but not remove it.\r\n\r\nHowever, for practical purposes, the race condition is gone.\r\n\r\nWith the reproduction steps in #17754, and this command\r\n```\r\nfor i in {1..10000}; do /tmp/bazel run :foo &> /tmp/log ; grep -q \"useful echo\" /tmp/log ; if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo -n '+'; else  echo -n '-'; fi; done\r\n```\r\na bazel from head fails ~3900 out of 10000 times.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, it never failed.\r\n\r\nCloses #17846.\r\nCommit: [c04f0d4](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/c04f0d41317bfe1f6ff42da94dddb4023587fc26)\r\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 518794237\r\nChange-Id: I8c1862d3a274799b864f0f5f42b85d6df5af78c7","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17869/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8839883937,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc5gqXRQzwAAAAIO5eyh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/8839883937","actor":{"login":"ShreeM01","id":109167932,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoHFPA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109167932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01","html_url":"https://github.com/ShreeM01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b8e92cc55378fb7b80f5abe0abf59d41f53ba483","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/b8e92cc55378fb7b80f5abe0abf59d41f53ba483","created_at":"2023-03-24T15:07:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9341166097,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc5gqXRQzwAAAAIsxuIR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/9341166097","actor":{"login":"fweikert","id":12609729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA5NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12609729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert","html_url":"https://github.com/fweikert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6062671ccd782d8b79c950a32d9736a21ac6b8ca","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fweikert/bazel/commits/6062671ccd782d8b79c950a32d9736a21ac6b8ca","created_at":"2023-05-25T14:57:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
