`download_and_extract` function supported various archive formats, but did not recognize `.whl` as a valid file extension for archive extraction. Since wheel files are ZIP archives with a `.whl` extension (per PEP 427), this commit adds support for them by treating `.whl` files the same as other ZIP-based formats.\r\n\r\nThis enables using Python wheel files directly with rules_multitool and other tools without requiring workarounds, particularly useful for air-gapped environments with private PyPI repositories.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Add .whl to ZIP decompressor condition in DecompressorValue.java\r\n- Update error message to include .whl in supported extensions list  \r\n- Update API documentation to include .whl as supported archive type\r\n- Add test case for .whl file extension handling\r\n\r\nFixes #26307\r\n\r\nRELNOTES[NEW]: `repository_ctx.download_and_extract` now supports the `.whl` file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP
