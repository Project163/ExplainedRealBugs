[repository_ctx.download_and_extract](https://bazel.build/rules/lib/builtins/repository_ctx#download_and_extract) to support the `.whl` file extension as a valid extension.\n\nIt's similar to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17824, closed by https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17825.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nI marked it as `Core`, but I'm not entirely sure which category it would fall into.\n\nThis is an attempt to retrieve artifacts from `.whl` files. The immediate use case is to retrieve `uv` from a `wheel` like [uv-0.7.13-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl](https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/46/c7/1d7ec2211732512ae43d7176242fea3eea1915c83565953014bbafcb6be2/uv-0.7.13-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl). \n\nWith this implemented, I could get [rules_multitool](https://github.com/theoremlp/rules_multitool) to work without changing the rule set.\n\nThis also enables other use cases and would be particularly useful for air-gapped environments, which may have private PyPI repositories with these artifacts available to be used as toolchains, but currently can't or would have to implement a solution for it.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nMacOS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.2.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nExample on the use case:\n\n```sh\ne 151, column 42, in _env_specific_tools_impl\n                rctx.download_and_extract(\nError in download_and_extract: Expected a file with a .zip, .jar, .war, .aar, .nupkg, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .tar.xz, , .tar.zst, .tzst, .tar.bz2, .tbz, .ar or .deb suffix (got /private/var/tmp/_bazel_albertocavalcante/dd9c9e40657187f29a81780e6261bc31/external/rules_multitool++multitool+multitool.macos_arm64/tools/uv/macos_arm64_archive/temp17017837084274542595/uv-0.7.13-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl)\nERROR: no such package '@@rules_multitool++multitool+multitool.macos_arm64//tools/uv': Expected a file with a .zip, .jar, .war, .aar, .nupkg, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .tar.xz, , .tar.zst, .tzst, .tar.bz2, .tbz, .ar or .deb suffix (got /private/var/tmp/_bazel_username/dd9c9e40657187f29a81780e6261bc31/external/rules_multitool++multitool+multitool.macos_arm64/tools/uv/macos_arm64_archive/temp17017837084274542595/uv-0.7.13-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl)\n```\n\n\n```json\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theoremlp/rules_multitool/main/lockfile.schema.json\",\n    \"uv\": {\n        \"binaries\": [\n            {\n                \"kind\": \"archive\",\n                \"url\": \"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/46/c7/1d7ec2211732512ae43d7176242fea3eea1915c83565953014bbafcb6be2/uv-0.7.13-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl\",\n                \"file\": \"uv-0.7.13.data/scripts/uv\",\n                \"sha256\": \"4f828174e15a557d3bc0f809de76135c3b66bcbf524657f8ced9d22fc978b89c\",\n                \"os\": \"macos\",\n                \"cpu\": \"arm64\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
