My compiler can't handle /\"/\" as a define.\r\n\r\nWithout --features=compiler_param_file set (and using the -s flag) , I can see that the command line is correctly escaped as `/DBAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY=\"\"` on the command line\r\n\r\nThe param file should directly mimic the non-param file build, where the the string is properly escaped.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n\nC++/Objective-C Rules, External Dependency\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
