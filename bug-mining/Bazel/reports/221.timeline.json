With Bazel 7.4.0, compiling a `.S` file on Windows with the clang-cl toolchain set up results in `MASM : fatal error A1013:invalid numerical command-line argument : /W` errors when there are clang-style arguments defined in copts (e.g. `--copt='-Wno-macro-redefined'`), whereas building \"just worked\" beforehand. It would be non-trivial for us to drop these flags without getting lots of warnings for compiling C++ code. I believe that this is being caused by #23406, so it looks like here the opposite of your case happens and the file compiles well with clang-cl but MASM fails since it can't digest the input arguments.\r\nI would file an issue for this, but I don't develop on Windows and only see this on CI so I can't easily provide a minimal reproducer. Maybe this points to another bug in the Windows toolchain configuration: Are copts supposed to be passed through to assemble? FWIW the error message says `Compiling external/v8/icu/embedded.S failed: (Exit 1): ml64.exe failed: error executing CppCompile command` so maybe assembling the .S file is still considered a cpp
