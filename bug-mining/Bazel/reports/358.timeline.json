Description of the bug:\n\n\nI have a C++ library which is located at `Foo/` relative to my repo root. All includes are done as `#include <Foo/Bar.h>`. Bazel doesn't want to do `-I<root>` to expose the entire repository for includes, which is understandable. However, even when I specify `include_prefix = \"Foo\"`, it doesn't create virtual includes under `bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/Foo/_virtual_includes/Foo/Foo`, which means other packages depending on this package are unable to include headers with `<Foo/Bar.h>` paths.\n\nSetting `include_prefix` to any other path, like `include_prefix = \"Fooo\"`, creates virtual includes which can then be referenced; it is only the exact path of the library itself that fails.\n\nSetting `includes = [\"..\"]` causes Bazel to refuse the path because it would expose the entire repository to all consumers of this library:\n```\nError in fail: attribute includes: '..' resolves to the workspace root, which would allow this rule and all of its transitive dependents to include any file in your workspace. Please include only what you need\n```\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nC++ Rules\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
