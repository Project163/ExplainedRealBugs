happy to consider changes here but I first want to understand if this is a blatant bug, is Bazel's implementation not being hip with the newest spec, or is a FR for a different spec. \n\nThis code is before my time (2009, according to the history of the code inside Google), so I honestly didn't/don't know the intended behavior off the top of my head.\n\nhttps://bazel.build/reference/test-encyclopedia says \"The XML schema is based on the JUnit test result schema\" and links https://windyroad.com.au/dl/Open%20Source/JUnit.xsd which says `time` has type `xs:decimal`. I looked at over 5 different websites on XML online and they all said `xs:decimal` is a decimal number with a period separator for the fractional part ([example](https://www.datypic.com/sc/xsd/t-xsd_decimal.html)).\n\n> Note the time=\"1.1e0\" attribute on the first testcase. Bazel correctly parses this as 1.1 seconds.\n\nI think that's just an implementation quirk where the code @rockwotj found does do something reasonable for that input.\n\n> Having a no decimal point is generally valid (most langs accept this, I could not find a counter-example at least) and this should be parsed correctly. These values were written by Boost test's JUNIT writer.\n\nDoes Boost's JUNIT writer not use `xs:decimal`? Or is the JUnit test result schema actually different than it was in 2009?\n\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2620395500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"haxorz","id":843410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzQxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/843410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz","html_url":"https://github.com/haxorz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haxorz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16101363891,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc6iYWtBzwAAAAO_t1Cz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/16101363891","actor":{"login":"rockwotj","id":8669100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8669100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj","html_url":"https://github.com/rockwotj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-29T01:29:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16101363926,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc6iYWtBzwAAAAO_t1DW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/16101363926","actor":{"login":"rockwotj","id":8669100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8669100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj","html_url":"https://github.com/rockwotj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-29T01:29:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2620658245","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24605#issuecomment-2620658245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24605","id":2620658245,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc6cNBJF","user":{"login":"rockwotj","id":8669100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8669100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj","html_url":"https://github.com/rockwotj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockwotj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-29T03:38:30Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T03:38:30Z","body":"@haxorz
