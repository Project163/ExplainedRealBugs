A build using `--experimental_remote_cache_compression` may result in 3-5x times higher JVM heap use compared to not using that flag.\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've minimized a repro here: https://github.com/jfirebaugh/bazel_remote_cache_compression\r\n\r\nCheckout that repository, add .bazelrc with appropriate remote cache configuration, and then compare the output of:\r\n\r\n1. `bazel clean && bazel shutdown && bazel build --memory_profile=memprof :binary && grep 'Build artifacts:heap:used' memprof`\r\n2. `bazel clean && bazel shutdown && bazel build --experimental_remote_cache_compression --memory_profile=memprof :binary && grep 'Build artifacts:heap:used' memprof`\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 6.2.1\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\ngit@github.com:jfirebaugh/bazel_remote_cache_compression.git\r\nmaster\r\nfatal: ambiguous argument 'master': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.\r\nUse '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:\r\n'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'\r\nfb76727c785f013541bb150120f2fecf14e79c58\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nHigh memory use with `--experimental_remote_cache_compression` was reported by another user on Bazel slack: https://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/CA31HN1T3/p1646921767090359?thread_ts=1646911448.469939&cid=CA31HN1T3\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\nI have done some initial investigation using JFR memory profiling, and it looks like one possible cause is the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nStack Trace\tCount\tPercentage\r\nvoid java.nio.HeapByteBuffer.<init>(int, int, MemorySegmentProxy)\t504\t34.4 %\r\n   ByteBuffer java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocate(int)\t504\t34.4 %\r\n   ByteBuffer com.github.luben.zstd.NoPool.get(int)\t471\t32.2 %\r\n      void com.github.luben.zstd.ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer.<init>(InputStream, BufferPool)\t471\t32.2 %\r\n      void com.github.luben.zstd.ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer.<init>(InputStream)\t471\t32.2 %\r\n      void com.google.devtools.build.lib.remote.zstd.ZstdDecompressingOutputStream.<init>(OutputStream)\t471\t32.2 %\r\n      ListenableFuture com.google.devtools.build.lib.remote.GrpcCacheClient.requestRead(RemoteActionExecutionContext, RemoteRetrier$ProgressiveBackoff, Digest, CountingOutputStream, Supplier, Channel)\t471\t32.2 %\r\n```\r\n\r\n[`requestRead` allocates `ZstdDecompressingOutputStream`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/e81cdb9411fc45cab22d270ee374628fcaab82f8/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/remote/GrpcCacheClient.java#L394), which allocates `ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer`, which uses `NoPool` to allocate via `ByteBuffer.allocate`. It appears the size allocated here is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/blob/e07f8970be0c72ce02dcdf1877daa034208915d0/src/main/native/decompress/zstd_decompress.c#L1668\r\n\r\nWhich if I've calculated correctly is 131 kB. And I assume this will allocate once for every in-flight cache read.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
