During the build, notice that the print statement is correctly evaluated.\r\n2. Modify the environment variable (e.g. `MYVAR=abc bazel build ...`)\r\n3. Notice that the print statement is not re-executed.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that repository rules are re-evaluated if I use `ctx.getenv`, but module extensions are not. Is it working as intended?\r\n\r\nTo me, this seems error-prone and can lead to correctness issues. I fail to see how `ctx.getenv` can be used in a safe way.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nExternal Dependency\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
