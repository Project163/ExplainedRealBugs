Description of the bug:\n\n\nIf you apply a patch to a `bazel_dep` using `single_version_override`, and that patch touches that module's `MODULE.bazel`, and you're using `--experimental_repository_cache_hardlinks`, then bazel will fail to fetch that module with an error that looks like:\n```\nWARNING: Download from
