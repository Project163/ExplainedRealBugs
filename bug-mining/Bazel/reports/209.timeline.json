summarize: there are really two issues here.\r\n\r\n# Bazel Crash\r\n\r\nWhen the `ExecutionTransitionFactory` doesn't get the Starlark exec transition, it crashes bazel. This is a major problem and we need to avoid it, probably by reporting an error but keeping the Bazel server alive. I have a few ideas towards this:\r\n\r\n1. Fix `ExecutionTransitionFactory` to just return an instance of `NoConfigTransition` when the Starlark exec transition isn't present.\r\n   1. @gregestren has suggested only doing this when the incoming config is also the empty config. This is possibly but tricky\r\n2. Fix `ExecutionTransitionFactory` to report an error directly (either by throwing an `EvalException` or returning an error message): this requires changing the `TransitionFactory` interface and potentially some cleanup of callers everywhere to handle this case.\r\n3. Fix `DependencyProducer` to directly check whether the transition factory is `ExecutionTransitionFactory` and the config is invalid. This is probably the most targetted but feels like a hack.\r\n\r\nI'd like @gregestren's opinion on which of these are cleaner: I am leaning towards number 2 personally.\r\n\r\n# Invalid dependencies in `constraint_values`\r\n\r\nIt'd be very nice to correctly note (before analysis) that `cc_library` doesn't provide `ConstraintValueInfo` and error out early: right now even with the crash removed, the dependencies will be fully analyzed before `platform` checks whether they are appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis looks fairly difficult to manage,, but I'm going to file a separate issue to track it and raise it with the appropriate teams. It's not solvable in the short term, so I propose using this issue to only track the actual crash.\r\n\r\n@tpudlik, does this make sense to you?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2230956007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"katre","id":326527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre","html_url":"https://github.com/katre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13521449114,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc6PSK62zwAAAAMl8PCa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13521449114","actor":{"login":"tpudlik","id":4148295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDgyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4148295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik","html_url":"https://github.com/tpudlik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-16T13:54:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13521449132,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc6PSK62zwAAAAMl8PCs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13521449132","actor":{"login":"tpudlik","id":4148295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDgyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4148295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik","html_url":"https://github.com/tpudlik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-16T13:54:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13521449151,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc6PSK62zwAAAAMl8PC_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13521449151","actor":{"login":"gregestren","id":5130366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzAzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5130366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren","html_url":"https://github.com/gregestren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-16T13:54:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13521449166,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc6PSK62zwAAAAMl8PDO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13521449166","actor":{"login":"gregestren","id":5130366

too).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2231425196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tpudlik","id":4148295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDgyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4148295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik","html_url":"https://github.com/tpudlik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpudlik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13600509825,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6PSK62zwAAAAMqp0-B","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13600509825","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6efef62a47833c346a342ecf48165f94f7b807c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/6efef62a47833c346a342ecf48165f94f7b807c4","created_at":"2024-07-22T12:26:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13606104943,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6PSK62zwAAAAMq_K9v","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13606104943","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"154c686d7ca1c2dd13109ac0ab1f8dca1408c9a2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/154c686d7ca1c2dd13109ac0ab1f8dca1408c9a2","created_at":"2024-07-22T19:46:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13606844192,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6PSK62zwAAAAMrB_cg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13606844192","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":

Description of the feature request:\n\n\nCurrently, required providers and advertised providers are not checked until after dependencies are analyzed, which means that invalid targets can produce errors that obscure the underlying problem of a bad dependency.\r\n\r\nIf a target's advertised providers were checked earlier against the parent target's required providers, an error could be shown earlier and would be more relevant to users.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nRules API\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nThis came up in #22996.\r\n\r\nConsider a `platform` target with an invalid dependency in the `constraint_values` attribute:\r\n```\r\ncc_library(name = \"lib\")\r\n\r\nplatform(\r\n    name = \"plat\",\r\n    constraint_values = [\r\n        \":lib\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `:lib` dependency is incorrect: [the `constraint_values` attribute requires a `ConstraintValueInfo` provider](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/platform/PlatformRule.java;drc=b5b5ca1399ff1fa60338449e7c5b6327bb280f69;l=72) that `cc_library` does not provide.\r\n\r\nHowever, because `platform` uses `NoConfigTransition`, when bazel tries to analyze the dependency, analysis fails with a confusing error (after the fix for #22996 is merged): \"expected a Starlark exec transition definition, but was null\".\r\n\r\nA better error would be \"The dependency //:lib is not appropriate because it does not provide ConstraintValueInfo\"\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n###
