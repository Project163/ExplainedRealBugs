This may not be the preferred approach, but is simple enough and used to work quite well. For instance:\r\n* Configure `umask` to `0002`.\r\n* Assign relevant users to a group `bazel-cache`.\r\n* Create the toplevel cache directory and `chmod g+ws <dir>` and `chown :bazel-cache <dir>`.\r\n* Configure `--disk_cache` and `--repository_cache` accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuote of the commit message\r\n> Making all directories group and world writable seems excessive;\r\n\r\nImho the user, system configuration or whatever decides if it is wanted – Bazel ist not in charge for that.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
