repository rule deprecates existing `rb_bundle()` and provides a\r\nnumber of benefits over existing implementation:\r\n\r\n1. Hermeticity of `bundle install` - it's run as a regular rule.\r\n2. Ruby toolchain no longer needs to be installed during WORKSPACE\r\n   loading.\r\n2. Downloading of gems is taken care of by Bazel. This also means that\r\n   gems are stored in a repository cache.\r\n3. RBE is potentially supported (at least with JRuby).\r\n\r\nThe new rule however is not complete yet and lacks few important\r\nfeatures that will be added later.\r\n\r\n1. Support for gems installed from Git repositories.\r\n2. Support for checksums introduced in Bundler 2.50.\r\n\r\nFor most cases, the migration from `rb_bundle()` to `rb_bundle_fetch()`\r\nis straightforward - use the same parameters with an extra `gemfile_lock`.\r\nThe main breaking change is that your targets that used to depend on\r\nBundler binstubs a new `bin` package. For example:\r\n\r\n| rb_bundle()         | rb_bundle_fetch    |\r\n|---------------------|--------------------|\r\n| `@bundle//:bin/rspec` | `@bundle//bin:rspec` |\r\n\r\nFixes #16 and #45.\r\n\r\nUPD: I just made Selenium CI pass using `rb_bundle_fetch()` so IMO this is good enough to merge and improve over time -

#20486\r\n\r\nWhile `to_display_form()` can be called in all contexts, it only returns apparent names for BUILD threads, which are the most common use case for display form labels. Support for module extensions can be added later, but requires explicit tracking of inverse mappings in the lockfile.\r\n\r\nAlso use `to_display_form()` to generate Clang module names in the correct form for external repositories. `java_*` rules require more delicate handling and will be migrated in a follow-up change.\r\n\r\nRELNOTES: The `to_display_form()` method on `Label` returns a string representation of a label optimized for readability by humans.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11675925604,"node_id":"AE_lADOATz7jc55WIwnzwAAAAK38Hxk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/11675925604","actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-01T21:13:30Z","assignee":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11772960611,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc55WIwnzwAAAAK9uR9j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/11772960611","actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"14ce414fb9d0e9479cddb12e608f6b4f95a8580f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmeum/bazel/commits/14ce414fb9d0e9479cddb12e608f6b4f95a8580f","created_at":"2024-02-12T10:55:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11779570115,"node_id":"CE_lADOATz7jc55WIwnzwAAAAK-HfnD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/11779570115","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_ad
