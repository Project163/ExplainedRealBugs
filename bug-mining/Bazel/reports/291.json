For example, if I have 4 pre-existing `use_repo_rule` statements and inset a new one between the 3rd and 4th, repositories created with the last repo rule will now be prefixes with `@+_repo_rules5+` where before they were prefixed with `@+_repo_rules4+`. This naming change requires updating any references to these repositories in the `MODULE.bazel.lock` file.\n\nHowever, these references are not always updated. For example, references in the attributes of other repository rules may not be updated, even after running `bazel mod deps --lockfile_mode=update`, leading to `Repository '@@+_repo_rules4+[name]' is not defined` errors at build time. See https://pwbug.dev/392155942 for a concrete real-world example of this.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nExternal Dependency\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
