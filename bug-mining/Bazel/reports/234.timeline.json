the AsyncTaskCache for remote execution uses the digest as a key to determine whether or not a task has already been run. Normally this works if there is only a single cache in use. However, when using a disk cache and a remote cache, some calls try to upload files using only a single cache through one code path and another cache through another code path.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic if only disk caching is used through one code path, when remote caching is enabled though another code path (ie, uploading BES referenced artifacts), the files are not uploaded to the remote cache since the digest is the same. This change uses a String of the digest and the cache type as the key rather than just the digest to allow for uploading to both caches.\r\n\r\nThe download path is not affected by this bug, so we don't need to make any changes there.\r\n\r\nAlso, update the combined cache test to reflect what should happen:\r\nwhen remote_build_event_upload=all, *all* files referenced in the BES\r\nstream are uploaded, including build artifacts (this test now functions as intended based on documentation due to this change).\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #20962,
