This creates a race condition if\r\n\r\n - two targets are built in parallel,\r\n - they have intersecting dependencies, and\r\n - they use the same mnemonic.\r\n\r\nBazel will try to overwrite the environment of the first target that starts building. The error message will be: `IOException while preparing the execution environment of a worker`\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\nCore\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Create a multiplex worker rule with sandboxing, say `some_library`. (The worker doesn't have to do anything, but it should sleep long enough so the race happens)\r\n2. Create three files, `a.txt`, `b.txt`, and `c.txt`.\r\n3. Write the following in a BUILD file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfilegroup(\r\n  name = \"ab\",\r\n  data = [\":a\", \":b\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\nsome_library(\r\n  name = \"a\",\r\n  srcs = [\r\n    \"a.txt\",\r\n  ],\r\n  deps = [\r\n   \"c.txt\"\r\n  ]\r\n)\r\n\r\nsome_library(\r\n  name = \"b\",\r\n  srcs = [\r\n    \"b.txt\",\r\n  ],\r\n  deps = [\r\n   \"c.txt\"\r\n  ]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n4. Try to build `:ab`\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nmacOS Sonoma\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 7.1.2\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\nIt's possible to work around this by generating a mnemonic for each target. This in itself is a bit difficult to do because mnemonics are only allowed to contain alphanumeric characters.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22589/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22589/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
