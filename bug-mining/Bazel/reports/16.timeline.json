reason why cc_shared_library wasn't working for upb_proto_library was because indirect cc_shared_library.deps (i.e.  linker_inputs not provided by the immediate dependency) were being dropped, that was fixed in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f9008f698467eb85657711c608db16086a9908eb. \r\n\r\nA second reason why it wasn't working was because until now cc_shared_library has relied on transitive deps providing CcInfo or ProtoInfo while the upb_proto_library aspect provides a custom wrapped CcInfo.  This change fixes that via aspect hints. (It would still require a change in the upb rule implementation).\r\n\r\nA third reason why it didn't work for upb was because to avoid a collision with the other aspects applied on proto_libraries, the upb_proto_library implementation added a suffix to the name when calling cc_common.create_linking_context(). This in turn caused the `owner` used in the `linker_inputs` to not match the labels of the targets seen by the cc_shared_library. To fix this, the hints provider accepts a list of owners.\r\n\r\nApart from those features, the hints provider also allows specifying a list of attributes for the cases where we don't want the result of every dependency to be used (this hasn't come up yet and it doesn't affect upb).\r\n\r\nThis idea was more or less described [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16296#issuecomment-1263395886).\r\n\r\nNote: I am using the words \"aspect hints\" because conceptually they are. However, none of this is using the aspect_hints mechanism supported by Bazel rules. Here we are simply using providers.\r\n\r\nFixes #17676.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8742538994,"node_id":"CE_lADOATz7jc5gJGeuzwAAAAIJGI7y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/8742538994","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"dbb09c9ea84cc6099ad7a30fa8206130d025f7ad","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/dbb09c9ea84cc6099ad7a30fa8206130d025f7ad","created_at":"2023-03-14T11:40:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9341164062,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc5gJGeuzwAAAAIsxtoe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/9341164062","actor":{"login":"fweikert","id":12609729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA5NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12609729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert","html_url":"https://github.com/fweikert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3eee2200bcdce747c590260a0f28e1cbfd08aedb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fweikert/bazel/commits/3eee2200bcdce747c590260a0f28e1cbfd08aedb","created_at":"2023-05-25T14:56:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
