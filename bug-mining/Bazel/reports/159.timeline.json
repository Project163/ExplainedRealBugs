Description of the bug:\n\n\n**Setup:**\r\n\r\n- Ten targets with one output file each (“prerequisite targets”).\r\n- One target that takes each of the ten prerequisite targets as input (“final target”).\r\n- Remote cache and remote execution.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction:**\r\n\r\n1. Build the prerequisite targets in output base A.\r\n2. Delete all entries from the remote cache (AC and CAS).\r\n3. Build the final target in output base B.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nBazel rebuilds everything successfully. Or Bazel exits with 39 because expected cache entries cannot be found remotely during evaluation.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\n  Logs from step 3 indicate exit code 34:\r\n```\r\nStarting local Bazel server and connecting to it...\r\nINFO: Invocation ID: 671b6d5b-516d-4685-8489-5b6e2e51c394\r\nINFO: Analyzed target //:all_files (5 packages loaded, 27 targets configured).\r\n[1 / 1] checking cached actions\r\n[1 / 12] 8 actions, 0 running\r\n    [Sched] Executing genrule //:target_2\r\n    [Sched] Executing genrule //:target_3\r\n    [Sched] Executing genrule //:target_6\r\n    [Sched] Executing genrule //:target_0\r\n    [Sched] Executing genrule //:target_7\r\n    [Sched] Executing genrule //:target_5\r\n    [Sched] Executing genrule //:target_9\r\n    [Sched] Executing genrule //:target_1\r\nERROR: /pay/src/cache-eviction-hang/BUILD:1:9: Executing genrule //:target_6 failed: (Exit 34): FAILED_PRECONDITION: Failed to obtain action: Object not found\r\nERROR: /pay/src/cache-eviction-hang/BUILD:1:9: Executing genrule //:target_9 failed: (Exit 34): FAILED_PRECONDITION: Failed to obtain action: Object not found\r\nERROR: /pay/src/cache-eviction-hang/BUILD:1:9: Executing genrule //:target_1 failed: (Exit 34): FAILED_PRECONDITION: Failed to obtain action: Object not found\r\nERROR: /pay/src/cache-eviction-hang/BUILD:1:9: Executing genrule //:target_5 failed: (Exit 34): FAILED_PRECONDITION: Failed to obtain action: Object not found\r\nERROR: /pay/src/cache-eviction-hang/BUILD:1:9: Executing genrule //:target_3 failed: (Exit 34): FAILED_PRECONDITION: Failed to obtain action: Object not found\r\nERROR: /pay/src/cache-eviction-hang/BUILD:1:9: Executing genrule //:target_0 failed: (Exit 34): FAILED_PRECONDITION: Failed to obtain action: Object not found\r\nERROR: /pay/src/cache-eviction-hang/BUILD:1:9: Executing genrule //:target_2 failed: (Exit 34): FAILED_PRECONDITION: Failed to obtain action: Object not found\r\nTarget //:all_files failed to build\r\nUse --verbose_failures to see the command lines of failed build steps.\r\nINFO: Elapsed time: 3.747s, Critical Path: 0.24s\r\nINFO: 11 processes: 11 internal.\r\nERROR: Build did NOT complete successfully\r\nBazel exited with 34\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Investigation:**\r\n\r\nWe have not tried going deep for this bug, this was found by accident while trying to reproduce https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21777.\r\n\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nRemote Execution\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nEnable remote executor locally on port 8980. In our reproduction, we used https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments/.\r\nCheck out https://github.com/hoj-stripe/cache-eviction-hang, run ./repro_34_exit.sh.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nUbuntu 20.04.6 LTS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 7.1.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other
