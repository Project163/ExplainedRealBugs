Although `bazel aquery 'deps(target)'` prints the command lines used to build a specific target, each command will be printed over N lines with one argument per line, which makes it harder to use command line tools to extract commands. For example, I cannot `grep` the output for a particular file name to extract all commands dealing with that file. And when I copy-paste the command into my terminal to edit it before running it, one-line-per-argument would typically cause the command to become taller than my terminal window, which makes it harder to edit in most shells. When working with Ninja-based build systems, I normally use the `commands` tool and `grep` its output. With Bazel I ended up writing an `awk` script that converts the `aquery` output into the one-line-per-command format:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\r\n\r\nORS=\"\"\r\n\r\nmatch($0, /Command Line: \\((.*) \\\\/, a) {\r\n  print a[1];\r\n  print \" \";\r\n}\r\nmatch($0, /^    (.*) \\\\$/, a) {\r\n  print a[1];\r\n  print \" \";\r\n}\r\nmatch($0, /^    (.*)\\)$/, a) {\r\n  print a[1];\r\n  print \"\\n\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut this script is clearly sensitive to Bazel's specific `aquery` format, which I imagine might change in the future. It also doesn't include environment variables, which fortunately I haven't needed so far. I guess it might be possible to feed one of the proto output formats into a separate program that converts the protos into the one-line-per-command format, but that would be a lot more work than my simple awk script. So the request is to add a straightforward and future-proof way to print the command list in this format, for example by adding an `--output=commands` flag.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 7.1.2\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22389/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
