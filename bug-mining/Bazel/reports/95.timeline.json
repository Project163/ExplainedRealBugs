\"wins\").\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/6c02329b1e1c549e916d5b2c77b60fbdd89a5b59/site/en/run/bazelrc.md?plain=1#L141-L143\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn practice, it is impossible to override an `--extra_toolchain` from an rc file on the command line.\r\n\r\nWhile the toolchains are indeed accumulated as per the options semantics, the way toolchain selection works is that the _first_ one wins. I had to reverse the options list to make the last defined one to be examined first during selection.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed that the test fails without the patch, and that the patch fixes the new test.\r\n\r\nFixes

effectively reverses the current semantics. Previously, the toolchains added via `--extra_toolchains` were all accumulated, in the order the flags were parsed, and added as the highest priority to the list of available toolchains. Unfortunately, this makes it practically impossible to use `--extra_toolchains` to override a toolchain already added by `--extra_toolchains`, especially if it was added in a blazerc file.\r\n\r\nWith this change, only the _last_ `--extra_toolchains` will have any effect, but multiple comma-separated toolchains can be added. The toolchains will still be kept in order defined in the single value used.\r\n\r\nFixes #19945.\r\n\r\nRELNOTES: The `--extra_toolchains` flag no longer accumulates values, instead the last usage of `--extra_toolchains` is used and others are ignored.\r\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 576922897\r\nChange-Id:

Description of the bug:\n\n\nPer https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19945, it was decided that elements later in the `--extra_toolchains` list should have higher precedence. This mostly works, but seems to regress when there are duplicates of a target in the list. When that happens, the _first_ position of a target takes precedence instead of the last.\r\n\r\nThis isn't too big a deal, but does makes having a `--extra_toolchains` value with consistent behavior between Bazel 6 and Bazel 7 a bit of a pain. Specifically, there isn't a single list that can get the desired behavior in both versions. For example, lets say we have two toolchain targets, `//a:all` and `//b:all`. We want to always use `b`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nextra_toolchains=[a, b]\r\nBazel 6: picks a\r\nBazel 7: picks b\r\n\r\nextra_toolchains=[b, a]\r\nBazel 6: picks b\r\nBazel 7: picks a\r\n\r\nextra_toolchains=[b, a, b]\r\nBazel 6: picks b\r\nBazel 7: picks a  <-- err wait what?\r\n\r\n# Hm, lets repeat the same value in different ways...\r\nextra_toolchains=[a, b, a]\r\nBazel 6: picks a\r\nBazel 7: picks b\r\n\r\nextra_toolchains=[a, b, a, b]\r\nBazel 6: picks a\r\nBazel 7: picks b\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo yeah, it seems like the first position in the list determines the final position when iterating. This smells very much like LinkedHashSet (first added is iteration order), or depset (first iterated upon is yielded, subsequents are ignored) doing something, somewhere.\r\n\r\nI skimmed through the RegisterToolchainsFunction.java code, but nothing in particular stuck out to me.\r\n\r\ncc @katre \n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nConfigurability\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nPass the same toolchain twice using `--extra_toolchains`.
