`--experimental_output_directory_naming_scheme` and `--experimental_exec_configuration_distinguisher` to `diff_against_baseline` and `off`, respectively, which makes it so that Starlark transitions can return to previous configurations, thus improving cache hit rates.\r\n\r\nAlso changes the fixed platform suffix in the exec configuration from an empty string to `\"exec\"` for compatibility with logic that looks for the substring `-exec-` in paths to determine whether the current configuration is the exec configuration.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this commit, output directory paths can change in the following ways:\r\n* `-ST-<hash>` suffixes can change or disappear and, in rare cases, appear where they previously didn't\r\n* for exec configuration directories, `k8-opt-exec-2B5CBBC6` becomes `k8-opt-exec-ST-011b9bdc32ed`\r\n\r\nThis may result in tool paths that are seven characters longer, which can cause builds on Windows to fail that were already very close to the `MAX_PATH` limit. A follow-up commit will reduce the length of the hash by three characters, bringing that increase down to four.\r\n\r\nWork towards
