Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\nUse a call to the `http_archive` function from `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl` that tries to download a `.tbz` file, eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n        name = \"opam_fmt\",\r\n        url = \"https://erratique.ch/software/fmt/releases/fmt-0.9.0.tbz\",\r\n        strip_prefix = \"fmt-0.9.0\",\r\n        build_file = \"@//saq/common/build/ocaml:fmt.BUILD.bazel\",\r\n        type = \"tar.bz2\",\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will raise an error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError in download_and_extract: Expected a file with a .zip, .jar, .war, .aar, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .tar.xz, .txz, .tar.zst, .tzst, .tar.bz2, .ar or .deb suffix (got /home/bsu/.cache/bazel/_bazel_bsu/6ee5cfe95d49437cbae81099cbfd479d/external/opam_fmt/temp479414337524270073/fmt-0.9.0.tbz)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nDebian testing\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 6.0.0-pre.20221012.2\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\ngit@github.com:benjamin-sb/bazel.git\r\n952438d4c7c69beec3a1dc643d564c116e0e1542\r\n2378e2d34f7a64007e6b2c96410261e416f737b2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nNo. Best we could come up with was using a wrapper that checks for the file extension and manually enforcing `type=\".tar.bz2\"` when necessary, but this is clearly a hacky workaround that we'd like to  avoid.\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
