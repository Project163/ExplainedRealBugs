The variables stack ( from thread gc root inwards ):\r\n\r\n```\r\nUIEventHandler.stateTracker.executionProgressReceiver.eventBus.subscribers.table[0] ( of type InMemoryMemoizingEvaluator )\r\nevaluator.graph.nodeMap -> contains many, many, many entries.\r\n```\r\n( Each of the threads seems to have their own InMemoryMemoizingEvaluator )\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this happens very consistently using BWOB and does not happen basically at all using non-BWOB builds.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake a large build with BWOB running over a rather large repository.
