curious what the latest with this issue is. I'm pretty sure we're encountering it and haven't found a good workaround yet, so we'd like to help fix it.\n\n*Background*\nWe implemented multiplex sandboxing support a few months ago on a Scala rule set for dynamic execution and path mapping benefits. That said, we haven't been able to enable multiplex sandboxing because of flaky build failures. The issues we've encountered include:\n* `FileNotFoundException` in JVM workers from the rule set when writing to files in the sandbox\n* `IOException while preparing the execution environment of a worker` from Bazel\n*  Files 'missing' from the sandbox, presumably because something couldn't write them or something clobbered them.\n\nThe issues were inconsistent and hard to reproduce, but common enough to be problematic.\n\nThe issues would all go away when we disabled multiplex sandboxing/stopped using dynamic execution for mnemonics that supported multiplex sandboxing.\n\n*Mitigation*\nI seem to have mitigated the issue by giving every action its own mnemonic, but that's not a viable solution. I more or less set mnemonic to `mnemonic = \"<mnemonic>{}\".format(_sanitize_label_for_mnemonic(ctx.label))` for all the mnemonics in the rule set that support multiplex sandboxing. This seems to have consistently stopped the aformentioned issues.\n\nBased on the symptoms and the mitigation, I think we're encountering this issue.\n\n---\n\nI think #23743 is a separate issue having to do with Skymeld, but it was an issue that we found in our search. I want to link it in case anyone stumbles across that issue on their way to this one.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2680801196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jjudd","id":3375226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzUyMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3375226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd","html_url":"https://github.com/jjudd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2684016806","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22589#issuecomment-2684016806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22589","id":2684016806,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc6f-tim","user":{"login":"jjudd","id":3375226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzUyMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3375226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd","html_url":"https://github.com/jjudd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjudd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-26T06:18:30Z","updated_at":"2025-02-26T06:18:30Z","body":"I think I have a fix for this.

It does so while ensuring each SandboxedWorkerProxy and the associated sandbox are still associated with the correct multiplexer process and working directory.\r\n\r\nResolves #22589\r\n\r\nI couldn't
