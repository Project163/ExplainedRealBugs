though.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/3120618935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gregestren","id":5130366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzAzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5130366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren","html_url":"https://github.com/gregestren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":18823133497,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOATz7jc67vhxpzwAAAARh8jk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/18823133497","actor":{"login":"gregestren","id":5130366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzAzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5130366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren","html_url":"https://github.com/gregestren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-25T22:59:44Z","label":{"name":"untriaged","color":"c34ddd"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18823133506,"node_id":"LE_lADOATz7jc67vhxpzwAAAARh8jlC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/18823133506","actor":{"login":"gregestren","id":5130366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzAzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5130366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren","html_url":"https://github.com/gregestren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregestren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-25T22:59:44Z","label":{"name":"P3","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/3150228346","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26312#issuecomment-3150228346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26312","id":3150228346,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc67xKt6","user":{"login":"comicfans","id":4547108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDcxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4547108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans","html_url":"https://github.com/comicfans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comicfans/received_events","type":"User","
