Task manager reports:\r\n\r\nBase speed: 2.85Ghz\r\nSockets: 2\r\nCores: 48\r\nLogical processors: 96\r\nVirtualization: Enabled\r\n\r\nWe are seeing bazel builds on this machine use 48 actions, so it only sees half the available logical cpus.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use `--local_resources=cpu=96 --jobs=96` to force bazel to schedule 96 actions, but overall cpu usage remains around 50%.\r\n\r\nThe bazel code uses JVM's availableProcessors() to determine cpu count. Windows Server uses '[Processor Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/procthread/processor-groups)' concept, and each socket is a ProcessorGroup. JVM has for a while had a limitation that it is only able to access compute within a single ProcessorGroup. But this limitation has been lifted by Microsoft in Windows Server 2022 and Windows 11, and a JVM change (https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-6942632) allows all sockets to be used by a single JVM.\r\n\r\nThis JVM change appears to have been backported to JDK21. Would it be possible to use such a JVM version in bazel so that it can work across multiple sockets?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\nCore\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
