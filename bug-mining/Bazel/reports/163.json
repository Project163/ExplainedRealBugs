It is solvable by running `bazel clean` but preferably should be addressed. The premise of the bug is that the in-process runfile tree creation does not handle all cases of the previuos runfile tree.\r\nWith the flags\r\n```sh\r\nbuild --enable_runfiles\r\nbuild --experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation\r\n```\r\nthe in-process symlink creation will be used and thus the bug can be triggered.\r\n In the example reproduction case, we have a target `output` that can be produced from two different inputs depending on a flag:\r\n```\r\nconfig_setting(\r\n    name = \"use_mode\",\r\n    flag_values = {\"//:use\": \"True\"},\r\n)\r\n\r\nmake_folder(name = \"make_folder\")\r\n\r\nuse_folder(\r\n    name = \"use_folder\",\r\n    srcs = glob([\"prepared/**/*\"]),\r\n)\r\n\r\noutput(\r\n    name = \"output\",\r\n    src = select({\r\n        \"//:use_mode\": \":use_folder\",\r\n        \"//conditions:default\": \":make_folder\",\r\n    }),\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the `output` target is built two times by using different input rules. The `make_folder` rule produces the files by running a shell script and the `use_folder` produces the same files by globbing them from the sources. Both of these inputs are linked using runfiles to the same output path albeit a little differently, with:\r\n* `make_folder` using `ctx.runfiles(symlinks = {\"lib\": directory})`\r\n* `use_folder` using `ctx.runfiles(symlinks = symlinks)` with a complete dict for each file.\r\n\r\nThe bug is triggered by building the `output` target twice in a row using different configurations, therefore forcing the runfiles tree builder into an edge case.\r\nDepending on the build oder, the error is slightly different:\r\n```\r\n$ ./repro1.sh\r\n[...]\r\nERROR: /private/tmp/repr/BUILD.bazel:21:7: Creating runfiles tree bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/exec_output.runfiles failed: java.io.IOException: <root>/execroot/repo/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/exec_output.runfiles/repo/lib (File exists)\r\nTarget //:output failed to build\r\nUse --verbose_failures to see the command lines of failed build steps.\r\nINFO: Elapsed time: 0.105s, Critical Path: 0.01s\r\nINFO: 4 processes: 4 internal.\r\nFAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom debugging, it seems that the `FileSystemUtils.ensureSymbolicLink` function does not do enough to ensure a symbolic link is created (i.e. if there is a folder where the symlink is supposed to go). This happens in the `repro1.sh` case.\r\n\r\nIn the second case `repro2.sh` it seems like a symlink is followed where it should not be:\r\n```\r\n$ ./repro2.sh\r\n[...]\r\nERROR: /private/tmp/repr/BUILD.bazel:21:7: Creating runfiles tree bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/exec_output.runfiles failed: java.io.IOException:<root>/execroot/repo/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/exec_output.runfiles/repo/lib/sample1.txt (File exists)\r\nTarget //:output failed to build\r\nUse --verbose_failures to see the command lines of failed build steps.\r\nINFO: Elapsed time: 0.088s, Critical Path: 0.00s\r\nINFO: 3 processes: 3 internal.\r\nFAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully\r\n```\r\nThe file that the `SymlinkTreeAction` is trying to overwrite is actually outside the runfiles root:\r\n```sh\r\n$ realpath <root>/execroot/repo/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/exec_output.runfiles/repo/lib/sample1.txt\r\n<root>/execroot/repo/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/lib/sample1.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn practice we have bumped into this by when migrating from `rules_node` to `rules_js` and when trying to optionally pull out some pre-built artifacts.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n[I have attached a zip file with a minimal reproduction example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/files/13413645/repro.zip), there are two errors that can be produced by running `repro1.sh` or the `repro2.sh` scripts.\r\n\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nMacOS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.4.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?
