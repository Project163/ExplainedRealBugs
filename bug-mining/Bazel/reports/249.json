We use it from the top level MODULE.bazel as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfetcher = use_extension(\"//src/repo/bazel/rules:fetcher_extension.bzl\", \"fetcher\")\r\nfetcher.artifact_with_plat(\r\n     name = \"artifact1\",\r\n     url = y\r\n     hash = z\r\n)\r\nuse_repo(\"artifact1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works fine. The artifact ends up in my extensions folder as `+fetcher+artifact1`\r\n\r\nHow do I then override this artifact using override_module? `--override_module=artifact1=...` does not work, and `--override_module=+fetcher+artifact1=...` does not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\nExternal Dependency\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
