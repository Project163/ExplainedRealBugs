it was a no-op for a symbolic macro implementation function to return a value. This CL makes it an evaluation error. (An explicit `return` or `return <expr that evals to None>` statement is still permitted.)\n\nThis is useful to enforce code clarity for symbolic macros. It may also help catch errors sooner when migrating legacy macros to symbolic macros. It also leaves the door open to having Bazel interpret the return values of macros in specific ways in the future.\n\nFixes #24312.\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 696153298\nChange-Id: Ib317871664c2036cc24ea31bc0033ec691fd07c8\n\nCommit https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/9e15ca3ca83120869b08bd5f45b27f110059e7e5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24315/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15290823753,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6eTra3zwAAAAOPZ3RJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/15290823753","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3532a6785ec8ab522e92ab30f59b0ea3a481af1b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/3532a6785ec8ab522e92ab30f59b0ea3a481af1b","created_at":"2024-11-14T00:01:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2495081017","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24312#issuecomment-2495081017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24312","id":2495081017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc6Ut-o5","user":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-22T23:19:53Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T23:19:53Z","body":"A fix for this issue has been included in [Bazel 8.0.0 RC3](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/8.0.0rc3).
