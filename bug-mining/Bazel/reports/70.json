The slowdown is in this loop in java_stub_template.txt: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/fcfcb929366dd3faac9643302b19c88bcf871ec6/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/rules/java/java_stub_template.txt#L309 for classpaths with ~250,000 and ~700,000 entries the loop takes 28 and 50 seconds, respectively, on an intel MacBook.\r\n\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n\nPerformance\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nRun a unit test with a very long runtime classpath.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nOSX\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.1.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\n\n\nPerformance regression seems to have been introduced in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d0ee889fca77e36f2c76ac07de3048055b8428c9\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nNo\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
