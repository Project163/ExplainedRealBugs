These two variables are set by Bazel during `bazel run`. However, if they are set in OS, Bazel would inherit them and not set them anymore, leading to machine dependent behaviors.\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n1. Create a repo like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- WORKSPACE --\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"io_bazel_rules_go\",\r\n    sha256 = \"56d8c5a5c91e1af73eca71a6fab2ced959b67c86d12ba37feedb0a2dfea441a6\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.37.0/rules_go-v0.37.0.zip\",\r\n        \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.37.0/rules_go-v0.37.0.zip\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@io_bazel_rules_go//go:deps.bzl\", \"go_register_toolchains\", \"go_rules_dependencies\")\r\n\r\ngo_rules_dependencies()\r\n\r\ngo_register_toolchains(version = \"1.19.3\")\r\n-- BUILD.bazel --\r\nload(\"@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl\", \"go_binary\")\r\n\r\ngo_binary(\r\n    name = \"runfiles\",\r\n    srcs = [\"main.go\"],\r\n    data = [\"@go_sdk//:tools\"],\r\n    deps = [\"@io_bazel_rules_go//go/runfiles\"],\r\n)\r\n-- main.go --\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n        \"fmt\"\r\n        \"log\"\r\n\r\n        \"github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/go/runfiles\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n        loc, err := runfiles.Rlocation(\"go_sdk/bin/gofmt\")\r\n        if err != nil {\r\n                log.Fatal(err)\r\n        }\r\n        fmt.Println(loc)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run:\r\n```bash\r\nRUNFILES_DIR=/tmp bazel run //:runfiles\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt outputs `/tmp/go_sdk/bin/gofmt`, but Bazel should ignore `RUNFILES_DIR=/tmp`, and output something like `/private/var/tmp/_bazel_zplin/a20570cf42c983bd18597126a6b3c06e/external/go_sdk/bin/gofmt` instead.\r\n\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nmacOS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.0.0-homebrew\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
