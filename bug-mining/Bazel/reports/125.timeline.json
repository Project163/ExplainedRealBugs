I tried running with `--flaky_test_attempts=1` and still saw the error.\r\n\r\nI dumped the server log and found the stack below. It looks like the error is coming from [`StandaloneTestRunner.writeOutFile`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/exec/StandaloneTestStrategy.java;l=347;drc=1f2d57631df9c61f0a15775cad72dc415a037ee4). It copies data from `test.err` to `test.log`, then attempts to delete `test.err`. I believe `test.err` is still open at this point, so the deletion fails.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.google.devtools.build.lib.skyframe.ActionExecutionFunction$ActionExecutionFunctionException:
