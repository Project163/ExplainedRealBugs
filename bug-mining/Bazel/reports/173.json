We run builds every 30 minutes in our CI system, so when two successive builds execute, sometimes it turns out that build 1 is in the middle of executing a long-running action when build 2 starts. Because we execute these actions remotely, when build 2 reaches that action it will request that the action executes remotely in RBE, and RBE will deduplicate the actions and return the result to build 2 at the same time it's returned to build 1.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this situation we've found that the JSON profile contains an `execute` span that corresponds to the amount of time that the full remote execution took, which means that we have an action that started before build 2 began. When this profile is loaded into Perfetto, the offsets for all actions are then computed relative to the start time of this already-started action instead of the time that the build actually started, which is confusing and requires us to do additional mental arithmetic to map the data in Perfetto to wall-clock times.\r\n\r\n![Perfetto_span_before_build_start](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/assets/117954304/162c298a-baf2-4587-abc5-dcdc1fc589c9)\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nRemote Execution\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
