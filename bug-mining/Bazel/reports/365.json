After migrating from Bazel 7 to Bazel 8, I noticed that external jars are constantly rebuilt after syncing the project in my IDE. Turns out that for some reason, the `--inject_repository` option leads to the re-creation of some jar manifests in rules_jvm_external. I'm reporting here because it seems to be a problem of Bazel itself, not the ruleset.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nJava Rules\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n1. Create the sample java project with Bazel, specify some maven dependencies, e.g.\n**MODULE.bazel**\n```starlark\nmodule(\n    name = \"null\",\n    version = \"0.1.0\",\n)\n\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_java\", version = \"8.10.0\")\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_jvm_external\", version = \"6.7\")\n\n# Set up Maven repositories for dependencies\nmaven = use_extension(\"@rules_jvm_external//:extensions.bzl\", \"maven\")\nmaven.install(\n    name = \"maven\",\n    artifacts = [\n        \"junit:junit:4.13.2\",\n    ],\n    repositories = [\n        \"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2\",\n    ],\n)\nuse_repo(maven, \"maven\")\n```\n2. Build project with `bazel build //...`\n3. Create empty folder named `repo` in project directory\n4. Run `bazel build --inject_repository=repo=./repo --execution_log_json_file=./sync-exec.json  @maven//:junit_junit`\n5. Run `bazel build --execution_log_json_file=./sync-exec.json  @maven//:junit_junit`\n\nExpected result: last two builds doesn't do anything, execution logs are empty\n\nActual result: some random jar manifests are rebuilt inside rules_jvm_external, logs are not empty.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nFedora 42\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.1.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nNo, didn't find any issues related to `--inject_repository`\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/27061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/27061/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
