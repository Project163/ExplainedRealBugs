When running coverage on `java_test`, the JRE from `--tool_java_runtime_version` will be used, which enables running the tests themselves with a different JRE. However, when running coverage on `py_test`, the JRE from `--java_runtime_version` will be used, so Bazel will fail if `--java_runtime_version` is a JRE 8.\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
