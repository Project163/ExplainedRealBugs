Bazel reports an error with both additions (see below).\n\nAlso, `--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution` is set by default since 7.0.0 so that can be called out explicitly.\n\n\n### Where do you see this issue? (include link to specific section of the page, if applicable)\n\n\nThe first section is broken:\n```\nregister_execution_platforms(\n    \":x64_windows-clang-cl\"\n)\n```\nBazel complains that this target must start with `@` or `//`.\n\nThe second section is broken, too:\n```\nregister_toolchains(\n    \"@local_config_cc//:cc-toolchain-x64_windows-clang-cl\",\n)\n```\nBazel can't find the `@local_config_cc` from this place.\n\nBut, if you simply ommit the changes to `MODULE.bazel`, everything works (you get `clang-cl.exe` for your Bazel build).\n\n### Any other information you'd like to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
