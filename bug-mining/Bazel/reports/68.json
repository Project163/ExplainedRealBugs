This can lead to increased memory usage for some code patterns.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n\nStarlark Integration, Starlark Interpreter\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nIn rules_xcodeproj we marshal a lot of data collected in aspects down the dependency tree. When doing Starlark memory profiling we noticed that creating new empty `depset` instances would drastically increase our memory usage. So instead we create frozen instances of empty values and use them when possible: https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/rules_xcodeproj/blob/31a9e114dac0e20625fb7d9119fe5a117ecb3608/xcodeproj/internal/memory_efficiency.bzl, which helped us reduce our memory usage.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nmacOS 13.4.1 (c)\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.3.2\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nhttps://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/CA31HN1T3/p1693484609534579 where @fmeum requested I open this issue.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
