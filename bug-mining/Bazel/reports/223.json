Description of the bug:\n\n\nI found my code which create socket with IPPROTO_ICMP \r\n```C\r\n#include <netinet/in.h>\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <sys/socket.h>\r\nint main() {\r\n  const int sock_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_ICMP);\r\n\r\n  if (sock_fd == -1) {\r\n    perror(\"create socket\");\r\n    return 1;\r\n  } else {\r\n    printf(\"success\");\r\n    return 0;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\ncan't run under linux-sandbox, without tags requires-network.\r\n if test has no requires-network tag, linux-sandbox will create network namespace,\r\nbut sys config /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range which controls the usability of IPPROTO_ICMP,\r\nwill be reset to default \"forbidden all\" value (see https://forums.opensuse.org/t/network-namespace-does-not-work-for-non-root-user/143817/2 and https://lwn.net/Articles/422330/). so after enter linux-sandbox,\r\ntestcase won't be able to use IPPROTO_ICMP to create socket.\r\nthis can be resolved when fakeroot is used and write valid gid \"0 0 \" to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range.\r\npodman also have similar process https://github.com/containers/common/blob/f34973f3d54cf4e7c7e14dac36f32fb6d46d9dd6/pkg/config/containers.conf#L66-L68\r\nI have a branch ,
