you told me the behavior at HEAD is by design, I'd grudgingly accept that and ask how we could help people like the Kleaf folks with their migration. They do have a point that this (and other behavior similarly surprising, if it exists) doesn't make migration to bzlmod easy. I have a number of ideas which could make this more intuitive, but given that I you and @Wyverald follow toolchains and bzlmod much closer than I do, I'd rather not voice them before being asked.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, I don't think there is a rush, at least from this project, given that they also need bzlmod vendoring to be able to turn bzlmod on. But let's not fall into the trap where both issues get deferred because they expect the other one to progress slowly :)\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1831837211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lberki","id":3524818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjQ4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3524818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki","html_url":"https://github.com/lberki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11095996776,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc54LL5ozwAAAAKVX3lo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/11095996776","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-29T12:50:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
