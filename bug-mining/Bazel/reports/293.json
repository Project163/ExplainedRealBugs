You can find with `man geninfo` or in the [hosted manpage](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov/blob/b1a533238dbf6a8a603a44c6ec46b2cbb57086a0/man/geninfo.1#L1445)\n\n```\n                     FN:<line number of function start>,[<line number of function end>,]<function\n                     name>\n\n              The 'end' line number is optional, and is generated only if the compiler/toolchain\n              version is recent enough to generate the data\n```\n\nHowever [Bazel's implementation in LcovParser.java](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/aa44c54c0fb48b99fe7a6257b5518087206daadd/tools/test/CoverageOutputGenerator/java/com/google/devtools/coverageoutputgenerator/LcovParser.java#L159) does not permit the 'end line number'. It's grammar is\n\n> `FN:<line number of function start>,<function name>`\n\nAs a result, coverage gathered with a tool like [coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/fcdce1deb2f182dc5a34fdc6d91b50033ed2badb/coverage/lcovreport.py#L92) cannot be parsed by Bazel.\n\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
