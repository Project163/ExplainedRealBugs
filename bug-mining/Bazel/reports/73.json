It's easy to miss this which means you spend a while figuring out why none of the Bzlmod sample content is working for you. \r\n\r\nAt a minimum tutorials like the migration guide should mention it, but in general the flag and how to use it need to much more prominent in the documentation and general examples.  For example [this external guide](https://blog.aspect.dev/bzlmod#heading-kicking-the-tires-yourself) mentions setting the flag in your RC file as the first step before doing anything else.\r\n\r\n### Where do you see this issue? (include link to specific section of the page, if applicable)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe https://bazel.build/external/migration is missing information on using the flag.\r\n\r\n### Any other information you'd like to share?\r\n\r\nHere is a proposed documentation patch.
