Bazel selects either `cmd_ps` or `cmd_bat` if the host machine is Windows and falls back to `cmd`.\r\n\r\nIt should select the script based on the execution platform, not the host platform.\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is a small example, as self-contained as I could get it. To reproduce, you'll need a remote execution service with Windows machines though, which I expect is rare.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- BUILD --\r\ngenrule(\r\n    name = \"hello\",\r\n    outs = [\"hello.txt\"],\r\n    cmd = \"do_not_run\",\r\n    cmd_ps = \"Set-Content -Path $@ -Value 'hello'\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nplatform(\r\n    name = \"windows_amd64\",\r\n    constraint_values = [\r\n        \"@platforms//os:windows\",\r\n        \"@platforms//cpu:x86_64\",\r\n    ],\r\n    exec_properties = {\r\n        \"Pool\": \"windows\",\r\n    },\r\n)\r\n-- .bazelrc --\r\nbuild:engflow --remote_cache=grpcs://kyanite.cluster.engflow.com\r\nbuild:engflow --remote_executor=grpcs://kyanite.cluster.engflow.com\r\nbuild:engflow --bes_backend=grpcs://kyanite.cluster.engflow.com\r\nbuild:engflow --bes_results_url=https://kyanite.cluster.engflow.com/invocation/\r\nbuild:engflow --tls_client_certificate=/Users/jay/.secrets/kyanite.crt\r\nbuild:engflow --tls_client_key=/Users/jay/.secrets/kyanite.key\r\n\r\nbuild:windows --platforms=//:windows_amd64\r\nbuild:windows --host_platform=//:windows_amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbazel build --verbose_failures --subcommands --config=engflow --config=windows //:hello\r\n```\r\n\r\nError output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSUBCOMMAND: # //:hello [action 'Executing genrule //:hello', configuration: d4de5ce9c2e00ceef8dc814dd8ca9ff265a3fbf8cd39f29d25d353798e0aaa0a, execution platform: //:windows_amd64]\r\n(cd /private/var/tmp/_bazel_jay/6ed3f141bd98e3e79c69ec8eab59bdfb/execroot/__main__ && \\\r\n  exec env - \\\r\n    PATH=/Users/jay/Library/Caches/bazelisk/downloads/bazelbuild/bazel-6.2.1-darwin-arm64/bin:/Users/jay/bin:/opt/go/installed/bin:/opt/google-cloud-sdk/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/opt/apache-maven-3.8.6/bin:/opt/prometheus-2.37.0-rc.0.darwin-arm64:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/jay/go/bin:/Users/jay/Code/depot_tools:/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin \\\r\n  c:/tools/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe -c 'source external/bazel_tools/tools/genrule/genrule-setup.sh; do_not_run')\r\n# Configuration: d4de5ce9c2e00ceef8dc814dd8ca9ff265a3fbf8cd39f29d25d353798e0aaa0a\r\n# Execution platform: //:windows_amd64\r\nERROR: /Users/jay/Code/scratch/BUILD:1:8: Executing genrule //:hello failed: (Exit 34): Remote Execution Failure:\r\nInternal: ChALVi9MaQ9CrKDcc0LvhbMMGiUKINzUijJzaXveNWnRcW7SmwOuDFuRH4-t-7h1pNt9R0fHEKAB: ERROR: external/bazel/src/main/native/windows/process.cc(202): CreateProcessW(\"c:\\tools\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe\" -c \"source external/bazel_tools/tools/genrule/genrule-setup.sh; do_not_run\"): The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n (error: 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 6.2.1\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\nn/a\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?
