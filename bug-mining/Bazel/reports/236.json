I noticed an interesting behavior in one of our repos lately after taking a closer look at our CI logs. We consistently see the same action/invocation failing with a remote cache eviction error and then recovering by itself.\r\n\r\nWe run the `bazel-diff` tool in a `bazel run` invocation, which always fails with the same missing digest `bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/external/rules_java/toolchains/platformclasspath.jar`. When I \r\nquery the remote cache for that particular digest using `tools_remote`, I get the correct blob returned. This means that the blob is in our remote cache, but somehow Bazel thinks it's not? I have an execution log for the specific situation as well if needed. I attached the part of the log where I could find two instances of this particular digest.\r\n\r\nBazel invocation log:\r\n```\r\nINFO: Invocation ID: 47418a6a-f67a-4bcb-8543-cc4d356708ce\r\nComputing main repo mapping: \r\nLoading: \r\nLoading: 0 packages loaded\r\nAnalyzing: target //tools/bazel_diff:bazel_diff (0 packages loaded, 0 targets configured)\r\nAnalyzing: target //tools/bazel_diff:bazel_diff (0 packages loaded, 0 targets configured)\r\n[0 / 1] [Prepa] BazelWorkspaceStatusAction stable-status.txt\r\nINFO: Analyzed target //tools/bazel_diff:bazel_diff (1 packages loaded, 2276 targets configured).\r\nERROR: /var/.../workspace/tools/bazel_diff/BUILD.bazel:3:12: Building tools/bazel_diff/bazel_diff.jar () failed: Failed to fetch blobs because they do not exist remotely.: Missing digest: REDACTED_DIGEST/138847674 for bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/external/rules_java/toolchains/platformclasspath.jar\r\nINFO: Found 1 target...\r\nTarget //tools/bazel_diff:bazel_diff failed to build\r\nINFO: Elapsed time: 1.627s, Critical Path: 0.02s\r\nINFO: 2 processes: 2 internal.\r\nERROR: Build did NOT complete successfully\r\nERROR: Build failed.
