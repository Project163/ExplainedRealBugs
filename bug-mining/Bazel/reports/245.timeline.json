didn't work at HEAD because the check there compared the flags in the new configuration with the flags of the old configuration, but overwrote the old configuration with the new one, so running a command that discarded the analysis cache was allowed the second time.\r\n\r\nThe fix is not as trivial as moving checking the value before setting the new configuration because creating the new configuration entails a Skyframe evaluation, which is a waste if we end up erroring out. So the check is now done by checking the build options of the old configuration and the new build options, which doesn't require creating the new configuration first.\r\n\r\nFixes
