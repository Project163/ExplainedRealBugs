Description of the problem:\r\n\r\nA `sh_binary` target that wraps a shell script has multiple outputs in some contexts. This means that a `sh_binary` cannot be used (at least not straight-forwardly) in some contexts. E.g. it cannot be used in `srcs` of another `sh_binary`, or `$(rootpath )` cannot be applied to it in some contexts (instead `$(rootpaths )` is required).\r\n\r\n### Bugs: what's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n**A `sh_binary` cannot be `srcs` to another `sh_binary`**\r\n```\r\nsh_binary(\r\n    name = \"script\",\r\n    srcs = [\"script.sh\"],\r\n)\r\nsh_binary(\r\n    name = \"wrapper\",\r\n    # ERROR: ... in srcs attribute of sh_binary rule //repro:wrapper: you must specify exactly one file in 'srcs'\r\n    srcs = [\":script\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n(A use-case would be a `sh_test` wrapping a `sh_binary` and extending the runfiles tree with additional `data` attributes.)\r\n\r\n**A `sh_binary` cannot be used with `$(rootpath )`**\r\n```\r\n# ERROR: ... in cmd attribute of genrule rule //repro:genrule: label '//repro:script' in $(location) expression expands to more than one file, please use $(locations //repro:script) instead.  Files (at most 5 shown) are: [repro/script, repro/script.sh]\r\ngenrule(\r\n    name = \"genrule\",\r\n    srcs = [\":script\"],\r\n    outs = [\"genrule.txt\"],\r\n    cmd = \"echo $(rootpath :script) > $(OUTS)\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n(A use-case would be generating a script file that calls another tool at runtime.)\r\n\r\nInstead one has to use the plural form `$(execroots )`.\r\n```\r\n# LINUX - NO ERROR\r\n#   repro/script repro/script.sh\r\n# WINDOWS - NO ERROR\r\n#   repro/script repro/script.exe repro/script.sh\r\ngenrule(\r\n    name = \"genrule\",\r\n    srcs = [\":script\"],\r\n    outs = [\"genrule.txt\"],\r\n    cmd = \"echo $(rootpaths :script) > $(OUTS)\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n(On Linux this happens to place the symlink `repro/script` first which makes it directly executable. However, on Windows it places the `.exe` second, meaning that additional logic is required to find the `.exe` from the result of `$(rootpaths )`.)\r\n\r\nHowever, one can use the singular `$(execroot )` in the context of `sh_test`:\r\n```\r\n# LINUX - NO ERROR\r\n#   ARG repro/script\r\n#   LOC .../execroot/com_github_digital_asset_daml/bazel-out/k8-opt/bin/repro/test.runfiles/com_github_digital_asset_daml/repro/script\r\n# WINDOWS - NO ERROR\r\n#   ARG repro/script.exe\r\n#   LOC .../execroot/com_github_digital_asset_daml/bazel-out/x64_windows-opt/bin/repro/script.exe\r\nsh_test(\r\n    name = \"test\",\r\n    srcs = [\"test.sh\"],\r\n    deps = [\"@bazel_tools//tools/bash/runfiles\"],\r\n    data = [\":script\"],\r\n    args = [\"$(rootpath :script)\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\nWhere `test.sh` looks as follows:\r\n```\r\n# Copy-pasted from the Bazel Bash runfiles library v2.\r\nset -uo pipefail; f=bazel_tools/tools/bash/runfiles/runfiles.bash\r\nsource \"${RUNFILES_DIR:-/dev/null}/$f\" 2>/dev/null || \\\r\n  source \"$(grep -sm1 \"^$f \" \"${RUNFILES_MANIFEST_FILE:-/dev/null}\" | cut -f2- -d' ')\" 2>/dev/null || \\\r\n  source \"$0.runfiles/$f\" 2>/dev/null || \\\r\n  source \"$(grep -sm1 \"^$f \" \"$0.runfiles_manifest\" | cut -f2- -d' ')\" 2>/dev/null || \\\r\n  source \"$(grep -sm1 \"^$f \" \"$0.exe.runfiles_manifest\" | cut -f2- -d' ')\" 2>/dev/null || \\\r\n  { echo>&2 \"ERROR: cannot find $f\"; exit 1; }; f=; set -e\r\n# --- end runfiles.bash initialization v2 ---\r\n\r\nfor arg in \"$@\"; do\r\n    echo ARG \"$arg\"\r\n    echo LOC \"$(rlocation \"$TEST_WORKSPACE/$arg\")\"\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\nUbuntu 19.10\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\nLinux: release 3.3.1- (@non-git)\r\nWindows: release 3.3.1-patched-1dac3221f72f5d22a0b79f0531af1f63\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns \"development version\" or \"(@non-git)\", tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\nOn Linux, built using nixpkgs revision 1d8018068278a717771e9ec4054dff1ebd3252b0\r\nOn Windows, built with the following [patch](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/blob/9f9aba5da837494f11b317dcada0738ca919b9a7/ci/patch_bazel_windows/patch-bazel), which should be irrelevant to the issue.\r\n\r\n###  Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\nWe encountered this issue when trying to work around the removal of `--noincompatible_windows_native_test_wrapper` on Windows. See https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/6761/commits/2248fcd2e389ac6f1041e5103ab1ec65bfd8d21c and https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/pull/6761/commits/23f4a59e7d2d71c3ca16b8fd42ef5c00f540ee00. We tried to replace instances of custom test rules that wrote an executable `.sh` file as the test executable, by a more generic `sh_inline_test` macro that combines a custom rule that generates a script file with a `sh_test`. With this change we had to replace instances of `ctx.executable.some_tool` by `$(rootpath :some_tool)`, which didn't work as described above. On Windows we have to be careful to find the `.exe` wrapper because the tool is invoked indirectly in a way that doesn't support shell scripts but only Windows executables.\r\n\r\nThe following test target illustrates the issue\r\n```\r\ncc_binary(\r\n    name = \"runner\",\r\n    srcs = [\"runner.c\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\nsh_inline_test(\r\n    name = \"inline-test\",\r\n    # ERROR: ... in _sh_inline_script rule //repro:inline-test_script: label '//repro:script' in $(location) expression expands to more than one file, please use $(locations //repro:script) instead.
