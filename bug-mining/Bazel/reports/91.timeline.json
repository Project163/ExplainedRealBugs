failures can be traced back to the removal of the implicit `local_repository(name=\"$WORKSPACE_NAME\", path=\".\")` clause in 9be1be93ff17dbb4cf0effb4f885911ec99cc30c.\r\n\r\nThe Kythe failure is due to usage of `bind` (https://github.com/kythe/kythe/blob/80d78947efb899a4f81bd6ce8e2118e925f8f05e/external.bzl#L1777), which does not respect repo mapping at all (see https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/packages/WorkspaceGlobals.java;drc=9be1be93ff17dbb4cf0effb4f885911ec99cc30c;l=139)\r\n\r\nThe Protobuf failure is much more annoying... [`@bazel_tools//tools/proto:BUILD`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:tools/proto/BUILD) defines a few aliases pointing into `@com_google_protobuf`. But since `bazel_tools` is injected in a WORKSPACE prefix, which happens before the `workspace` call, these aliases don't know that `@com_google_protobuf` actually means `@` (the main repo). Luckily this is a WORKSPACE-only problem (goes away with `--enable_bzlmod` and a minimal MODULE.bazel file containing `module(name='protobuf',repo_name='com_google_protobuf')`). But given https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/14313, this might be rather tricky to tackle.\r\n\r\nI'll try to fix the Kythe failure first.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1787814450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10824885223,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOATz7jc51RuBSzwAAAAKFNqPn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10824885223","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-31T18:53:11Z","label":{"name":"team-OSS","color":"f1f442"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10824885231,"node_id":"LE_lADOATz7jc51RuBSzwAAAAKFNqPv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10824885231","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-31T18:53:11Z","label":{"name":"team-ExternalDeps","color":"f1f442"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10825545093,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc51RuBSzwAAAAKFQLWF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10825545093","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"be050800a8fb64bfb6b489b73100c7225264e81f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/be050800a8fb64bfb6b489b73100c7225264e81
