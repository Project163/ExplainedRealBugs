This causes all sorts of failures down the line (for example when using bazel's `runfiles.bash` rules)\r\n\r\nCode in question: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/4427a1fb0cf537da82e1ca4841e0cecda99e1107/tools/python/python_bootstrap_template.txt#L239\r\n(compare to previous stanza)\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate it, we need any bazel repo which uses python runfiles lib. Bazel's own `rules_pkg` is one example. \r\nFirst, check out and run the test. It should work: \r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg.git\r\ncd rules_pkg\r\nbazel run //tests:stamp_test  # This works\r\n```\r\nNow naively package the runfiles dir and try to use it. Note we've got `stamp_test.runfiles/MANIFEST` (inside runfiles) but forgot `stamp_test.runfiles_manifest`:\r\n```\r\nrm -rf /tmp/work && mkdir /tmp/work && cp -r bazel-bin/tests/stamp_test bazel-bin/tests/stamp_test.runfiles /tmp/work && /tmp/work/stamp_test\r\n...\r\nNotADirectoryError: [Errno 20] Not a directory: '/tmp/work/stamp_test.runfiles/MANIFEST/rules_pkg/tests/stamped_zip.zip'\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 2 tests in 0.002s\r\n\r\nFAILED (errors=2)\r\n```\r\nobserve how it treats `stamp_test.runfiles/MANIFEST` file as a directory and fails.\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious Ubuntu versions (18.04, 20.04, 22.04)\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is present in HEAD and was introduced in 2018. Testcases above were tested on 6.0.0\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel.git\r\n4427a1fb0cf537da82e1ca4841e0cecda99e1107\r\n4427a1fb0cf537da82e1ca4841e0cecda99e1107\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nNothing. I am guessing very few people use custom bazel packaging scripts that only copy one file but not both.\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\nWe have a workaround which is to copy both files, and it probably is more correct that way, too. I am reporting this bug for the unlikely case someone else encounters it.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds for my test case above:\r\n- Include both manifest files:\r\n```\r\nrm -rf /tmp/work && mkdir /tmp/work && cp -r bazel-bin/tests/stamp_test{,.runfiles,.runfiles_manifest} /tmp/work && /tmp/work/stamp_test\r\n..\r\nOK\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Do not include any manifest files\r\n```\r\nrm -rf /tmp/work && mkdir /tmp/work && cp -r bazel-bin/tests/stamp_test{,.runfiles} /tmp/work && rm -f /tmp/work/stamp_test.runfiles/MANIFEST && /tmp/work/stamp_test\r\n..\r\nOK\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
