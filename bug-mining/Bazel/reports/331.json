We noticed that assertExecutableSymlinkPresent takes a considerable amount of time - presumably because it has to flatten the runfiles tree ( we have a lot of binaries with a lot of runfiles in ).\n\nThe average time to analyse our monorepo on a 32 core machine is roughly 600s, with said assertion removed it drops down to 360s~, almost a 50% drop in total time.\n\nDo you think there's something we could do about this? Maybe we could hide this assertion under a flag affecting starlark semantics?\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nPerformance\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\nRun analysis on any large monorepo, and then try the same thing patching out the assertion.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\nLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\nI tried this on 6.5.0 but relevant code is present in latest Bazel version.\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26242/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
