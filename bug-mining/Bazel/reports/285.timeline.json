Description\r\n\r\nChanges to upgrade to Bazel 8.0.0 \r\n\r\n- Created a MODULE.bazel file with the dependencies in it.\r\n- Removed the WORKSPACE file\r\n- Changed the compiler registration to be in the MODULE.bazle file (https://bazel.build/external/migration#register-toolchains) \r\n- Added the --noincompatible_disallow_empty_glob to the bazelrc for change in native.glob behavior in bazel 8.0.0 vs bazel 7.0.0 (https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference)\r\n- Updated the Ubuntu version to ubuntu-24.04, this was to be able to pull in the latest ar utility for linking static libraries. In ubuntu-22.04 had an isssue linking the static libraries using the bazel 8.0 directory names.\r\n- Added -Wno-dangling-reference to gcc compilation for a false positive possibly dangling reference error in //examples/oneapi/cpp:subgraph_isomorphism_batch_host bazzel test. \r\n\r\nAll of these changes can be found in the bazel migration guide (https://bazel.build/external/migration)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPR should start as a draft, then move to ready for review state after CI is passed and all applicable checkboxes are closed.\r\nThis approach ensures that reviewers don't spend extra time asking for regular requirements.\r\n\r\nYou can remove a checkbox as not applicable only if it doesn't relate to this PR in any way.\r\nFor example, PR with docs update doesn't require checkboxes for performance while PR with any change in actual code should have checkboxes and justify how this code change is expected to affect performance (or justification should be self-evident).\r\n\r\nChecklist to comply with **before moving PR from draft**:\r\n\r\n**PR completeness and readability**\r\n\r\n- [X] I have reviewed my changes thoroughly before submitting this pull request.\r\n- [X] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [X] I have updated the documentation to reflect the changes or created a separate PR with update and provided its number in the description, if necessary.\r\n- [X] Git commit message contains an appropriate signed-off-by string _(see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/scikit-learn-intelex/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) for details)_.\r\n- [X] I have added a respective label(s) to PR if I have a permission for that.\r\n- [X] I have resolved any merge conflicts that might occur with the base branch.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run it locally and tested the changes extensively.\r\n- [X] All CI jobs are green or I have provided justification why they aren't.\r\n- [X] I have extended testing suite if new functionality was introduced in this PR.\r\n\r\n**Performance**\r\n\r\n- [X] I have measured performance for affected algorithms using [scikit-learn_bench](https://github.com/IntelPython/scikit-learn_bench) and provided at least summary table with measured data, if performance change is expected.\r\n- [X] I have provided justification why performance has changed or why changes are not expected.\r\n- [X] I have provided justification why quality metrics have changed or why changes are not expected.\r\n- [X] I have extended benchmarking suite and provided corresponding scikit-learn_bench PR if new measurable functionality was introduced in this PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uxlfoundation/oneDAL/issues/3035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uxlfoundation/oneDAL/issues/3035/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2594679144","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23929#issuecomment-2594679144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23929","id":2594679144,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc6ap6lo","user":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-16T07:02:57Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T07:02:57Z","body":"A fix for this issue has been included in [Bazel 8.0.1 RC1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/8.0.1rc1).
