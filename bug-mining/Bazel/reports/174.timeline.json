This is visible in BuildBuddy UI by the fact that the list of passed tests (eg. in the targets tab) don't show up anymore as soon as each test finishes, but rather only all at once at the end of the run.

Description of the bug:\r\n\r\n\r\nExecuting `bazel test //... --keep_going` on our repository when upgrading from Bazel `6.5.0` to `7.0.2` (or `7.1.1`) causes extreme slowdown.\r\n\r\nAppending ` --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution=false` seems to fix the issue. Suggesting it's a problem with Skymeld. Note that we had skymeld enabled on Bazel `6.5.0` without problems.\r\n\r\nThe issue manifests as a very slow one-at-a-time execution with `checking cached actions` showing up on CLI.\r\n\r\nBazel profile is full of these:\r\n![image](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/assets/666705/564b9a35-bfe1-42c4-90b7-beb2e1d9daec)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/assets/666705/db3d6c73-087b-4e89-8fa2-4d00d7e6249b)\r\n\r\nand traces like:\r\n![image](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/assets/666705/5c5af8a6-c007-47eb-9b51-ebe1a4c22410)\r\n\r\nLooking at the JFR it seems like the time is spent here with a lot of map/string operations:\r\n![image](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/assets/666705/232100d8-816f-476a-81bc-86c6366953ed)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/assets/666705/90ef8e23-f679-4461-afd3-799bb9c9a0a7)\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be stemming from this semaphore [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/bazelbuild/bazel@e60b8fb5f698e6566b85ce0ec01cab9a818c68a0/-/blob/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/IncrementalArtifactConflictFinder.java?L244).\r\n\r\nWe have a relatively large repo: `Analyzing: 175831 targets (74369 packages loaded, 764940 targets configured)` and I had to fix a bunch of things to move us to Bazel 7 so the bisect is not working great as the fixes are not backward compatible. I'm hoping this is enough for someone to know what's going on but happy to devote more time to identify the rootcause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not have a reproduction right now. Our repository is large and private, I'm happy to try and create something but would like to get some feedback on the issue first.\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 7.0.2\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\nIt's a private repository\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, `6.5.0` seems to work correctly wheres `7.0.2` fails but I was unable to bisect cleanly.\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be bunch of reports around `checking cached actions` but they seem unrelated (like https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21712)\r\n\r\nI tried to search for Skymeld specific issues but only found the coverage issue [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21475) which would also be a blocker for us to upgrading but is unrealted.\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\n_No

coverage artifacts are now requested in `CompletionFunction` to ensure that they are built before the `TargetCompleteEvent` is generated. This makes it unnecessary to delay sending these events until after a Skymeld build has had the chance to request all coverage artifacts directly, which could only be done after the analysis & execution phase, thus delaying events until the end of the build.\r\n\r\nFixes #21475","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22238/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12730470442,"node_id":"CE_lADOATz7jc6AJV7dzwAAAAL2y5Aq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/12730470442","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"fd2cc92ad7aa27878645b15c52474c9019233de9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/fd2cc92ad7aa27878645b15c52474c9019233de9","created_at":"2024-05-07T14:23:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
