Modify `WindowsFileSystem#createSymbolicLink` to create the junction/symlink appropriately based on the hint (other filesystems may use a default implementation that ignores the hint)\n3. Modify `RemoteActionFileSystem` to detect the case when the symlink target path matches one of the action's inputs, and use the type of that input (as given by its metadata, i.e., without examining the on-disk state) as the hint when calling `FileSystem#createSymbolicLink`.\n\nI don't have the time to work on this right now, but I'd happily review a PR.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/3151263866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/3151269920","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26701#issuecomment-3151269920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26701","id":3151269920,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc671JAg","user":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-04T15:36:07Z","updated_at":"2025-08-04T15:36:07Z","body":"Oh, but this only works if the symlink target is a `declare_directory` or `declare_file`.

Description of the bug:\n\n\nSource directories cannot be symlinked by using an output declared using `ctx.actions.declare_directory`, whereas generated directories can. This means this cannot be used as a type of hint for whether to create a file or directory symlink on Windows (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26701).\n\nThis could be the same root cause as https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12954, which is another case where source directories are not considered to be directories.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nI’ve created a reproducer here: [bazel-symlink-source-dir.tar.gz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21601992/bazel-symlink-source-dir.tar.gz)\n\nBuilding `:generated_directory_symlink` works fine, but the similar `:source_directory_symlink` does not, giving the following error:\n\n```\nError in symlink: symlink() with \"target_file\" file param requires that \"output\" be declared as a file (did you mean to use declare_file() instead of declare_directory()?)\n```\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nUbuntu\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.3.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\nN/a\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\nN/a\n```\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\nN/a\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nNo\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nNo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26705/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/3155470179","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26701#issuecomment-3155470179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26701","id":3155470179,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc68FKdj","user":{"login":"cameron-martin","id":1467158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjcxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1467158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin","html_url":"https://github.com/cameron-martin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameron-martin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-05T14:29:13Z","updated_at":"2025-08-05T14:29:13Z","body":">
