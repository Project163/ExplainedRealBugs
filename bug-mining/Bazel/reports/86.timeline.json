Description of the bug:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following two issues are found when I have unnecessary stubbing in tests with Mockito and JUnit.\r\n\r\n1. unnecessary stubbings errors are swallowed and test passed when test_filter is being used, however, it failed as expected without test_filter\r\n2. unnecessary stubbings errors are NOT reported in JUnit reports regardless of using test_filter or not. The JUnit report shows all tests have passed.\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Add some unnecessary stubbings in a test\r\n2. Run `bazel run` with the corresponding target and it would fail as expected, however, the JUnit report doesn't mention this at all\r\n3. Run `bazel run` with the corresponding target as well as `test_filter` for a specific test case, it wouldn't fail at all and the JUnit report doesn't mention this error either.\r\n\r\n Please follow this [repo](https://github.com/henrypoon/bazel-test-filter-issues) to reproduce. \r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nMacOS Monterey\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 5.2.0-homebrew\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\nAlso reported to https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/issues/71","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16251/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
