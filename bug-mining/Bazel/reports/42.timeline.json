Can you expand you use-case further, provide an example macro? I find it weird you'd need rule kind in a macro, as they are usually written for specific rules.\r\n\r\nWe have a macro which works in tandem with a few repository rules to allow someone doing a build to choose which generation of CUDA and TensorFlow-related libraries they want to use so we can upgrade subsets of the repository to new TF versions incrementally.  It looks similar to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlinfra_platform_target(\r\n    cc_library,\r\n    name = \"foo\",\r\n    ...,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis macro wraps arbitrary rules, stubs them out when the build isn't compatible with them, and applies tags based on a generic notion of the rules' categories (binary, library, test, etc.) so we can track the progress of these upgrades using queries.  The `repr` representation of these rules is the only thing this macro has at its disposal to do this categorization; rule functions have no other means of introspection.  Apart from this tagging, there simply is no need to have different macros for different rules, so we opted to simplify and not deal with proliferating nearly-identical macros.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1442447821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gholms","id":92943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms","html_url":"https://github.com/gholms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gholms/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-14T15:08:14Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T15:08:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18392","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18392/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18392/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18392/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18392","id":1708976220,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATz7jc5QdLaI","number":18392,"title":"Include
