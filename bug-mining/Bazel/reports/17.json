Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nBUILD file:\r\n```starlark\r\npy_binary(\r\n    name = \"bin\",\r\n    srcs = [\"bin.py\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\nalias(\r\n    name = \"alias\",\r\n    actual = \":bin\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun: `bazel cquery --output=starlark --starlark:expr=\"providers(target).get(\\\"FilesToRunProvider\\\").executable.path\" :alias`\r\n\r\nexpect to get an output path.
