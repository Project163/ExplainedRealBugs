Description of the bug:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have custom rules that create symlinks that at the time of the build are intentionally broken links that are then fed into another rule that composes them into an artifact where the links are valid.

a tree artifact containing a symlink to a directory, as e.g. would be produced by the following action:\r\n\r\n```\r\nd = ctx.actions.declare_directory(...)\r\nctx.actions.run_shell(\r\n  outputs = [d],\r\n  command = \"cd $1 && mkdir dir && touch dir/file.txt && ln -s dir sym\",\r\n  arguments = [d.path],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, this will result in `ActionOutputMetadataStore#constructTreeArtifactValueFromFilesystem` collecting a `TreeArtifactValue` with two entries: `dir/file.txt`, mapping to a `FileArtifactValue`, and `sym`, mapping to a `DirectoryArtifactValue`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to `DirectoryArtifactValue` being unsound, the mismatch between the \"artifact type\" and \"metadata type\" is a source of bugs (#20415 is a recent example). I think it would be better for the symlink to be transparently followed (i.e., collect a `TreeFileArtifact`+`FileArtifactValue` for `sym/file.txt`).\r\n\r\nOne thing we need to be careful about is that the symlink could point outside of the tree artifact (which is [explicitly permitted](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/TreeArtifactValue.java;l=588;drc=de9d1f59915a36229978d46b78a22c9e5389db92)), and in this case, while we still want to collect the metadata, we should avoid calling `chmod` on the subtree.

cases.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20418/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-03T16:28:01Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T16:28:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20419","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20419/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20419/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20419/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20419","id":2022612964,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATz7jc5g_Qe1","number":20419,"title":"Fix

a tree artifact contains a symlink to a directory, the TreeArtifactValue contains a TreeFileArtifact mapping to a DirectoryArtifactValue (see #20418).\r\n\r\nBecause the file type to be uploaded to the BES is determined solely by the Artifact type, this causes the uploader to attempt to upload a directory as if it were a file. This fails silently when building with the bytes; when building without the bytes, it crashes when attempting to digest the (in-memory) directory, which has no associated inode (see #20415).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the file type computation to take into account both the artifact and its metadata, preferring the latter when available.\r\n\r\nFixes

a tree artifact contains a symlink to a directory, the TreeArtifactValue contains a TreeFileArtifact mapping to a DirectoryArtifactValue (see #20418).\n\nBecause the file type to be uploaded to the BES is determined solely by the Artifact type, this causes the uploader to attempt to upload a directory as if it were a file. This fails silently when building with the bytes; when building without the bytes, it crashes when attempting to digest the (in-memory) directory, which has no associated inode (see #20415).\n\nThis PR fixes the file type computation to take into account both the artifact and its metadata, preferring the latter when available.\n\nFixes #20415.\n\nCloses #20419.\n\nCommit https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/bb5ff63d18abda883f2ccf7cf47e009ef6012420\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 587654070\nChange-Id: Ib62bbaaed62b00c12bcabdc2bc9bee57aee0bcef","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20424/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11138450744,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc54hlpwzwAAAAKX50U4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/11138450744","actor":{"login":"keertk","id":110264242,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpJ_sg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110264242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk","html_url":"https://github.com/keertk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8e2dfcda3debcb5a1aac507a9bf8a5ded6203bc2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/8e2dfcda3debcb5a1aac507a9bf8a5ded6203bc2","created_at":"2023-12-04T12:29:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1839847412","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20415#issuecomment-1839847412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20415","id":1839847412,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5tqdf0","user":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-05T01:31:18Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T01:31:18Z","body":"A fix for this issue has been included in [Bazel 7.0.0 RC6](https://releases.bazel.build/7.0.0/rc6/index.html).
