the `target_compatible_with` on `alias()` targets only works\r\nwhen a `select()` is involved. That's because `alias()` targets by\r\ndefault don't have a toolchains evaluated.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the behaviour by making it so all `alias()` targets\r\nwith a `target_compatible_with` attribute are skipped appropriately.\r\nWhen `target_compatible_with` is present, then toolchains are\r\nevaluated for `alias()` targets.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is basically an enhancement to @gregestren's\r\n1c3a2456c95fd19974a5b2bd33c5ebdb2b2277e4 (bazelbuild/bazel#14310). In\r\naddition to resolving toolchains when a `select()` is present, Bazel\r\nwill now also resolve toolchains when a `target_compatible_with`\r\nattribute is set.\r\n\r\nI also took this opportunity to rename `HAS_SELECT` to something\r\nmore appropriate. The name may be too long now, but I feel\r\nthat at least it's descriptive.\r\n\r\nFixes #17663","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8950073712,"node_id":"CE_lADOATz7jc5f8S8yzwAAAAIVd0lw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/8950073712","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"1d2e9c87f50051aa4031a432a53e076d382f63be","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/1d2e9c87f50051aa4031a432a53e076d382f63be","created_at":"2023-04-06T22:05:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9341167441,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc5f8S8yzwAAAAIsxudR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/9341167441","actor":{"login":"fweikert","id":12609729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA5NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12609729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert","html_url":"https://github.com/fweikert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fweikert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"856518d7ea41e97880a2515a338f111f728be55d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fweikert/bazel/commits/856518d7ea41e97880a2515a338f111f728be55d","created_at":"2023-05-25T14:57:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
