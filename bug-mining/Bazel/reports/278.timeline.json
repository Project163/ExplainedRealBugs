It goes like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntouch MODULE.bazel\r\necho 'filegroup(name=\"fg\", srcs=glob([\"**/*.txt\"]))' > BUILD.bazel\r\necho '/foo' > .bazelignore\r\n\r\nbazel query --output=build :fg\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix is trivial. I could imagine treating `/foo` as `foo` in `.bazelignore`, but given that AFAICT the entries starting with slashes are just ignored, I'll just make it an error (but not a crash).\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to remove the entries starting with a slash in `.bazelignore`, since both according to my reading of the code and my experiments, they are ignored anyways.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2530640999/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lberki","id":3524818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjQ4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3524818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki","html_url":"https://github.com/lberki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15595869833,"node_id":"AE_lADOATz7jc6ikzGszwAAAAOhlhaJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/15595869833","actor":{"login":"lberki","id":3524818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjQ4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3524818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki","html_url":"https://github.com/lberki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-10T07:23:20Z","assignee":{"login":"lberki","id":3524818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjQ4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3524818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki","html_url":"https://github.com/lberki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15598463887,"node_id":"CE_lADOATz7jc6ikzGszwAAAAOhvauP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/15598463887","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"7879fac3ad3680114e8a988d4ae00522953e58fa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/7879fac3ad3680114e8a988d4ae00522953e58fa","created_at":"2024-12-10T10:25:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2531656039","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24
