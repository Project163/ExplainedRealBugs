With `--enable_workspace`, we happen to have a fallback in the WORKSPACE file (which gives an empty repo mapping for nonexistent repos); this fallback is not there with `--noenable_workspace`.\r\n\r\nNow, it's not completely clear to me what the correct behavior should be. What should we use as the repo mapping of `@@foo`? If we give it an empty mapping, it essentially means that `@@foo` cannot use any labels with a repo part (e.g. `load(\"@bazel_skylib//...` would fail). As an alternative, it's arguable that we should just outright fail, since `@@foo` isn't defined anywhere. @lbcjbb, could you share a bit about your use case with the \"external aspect\"? Is it for IDE usage?\r\n\r\nIn any case, we definitely shouldn't crash.
