a repo rule's attributes might contain invalid labels because of unresolved apparent repo names. This could be due to either module extensions generating bad repo definitions, or users providing e.g. bad labels to `patches` attribute of overrides. This causes us to write a label like `@@[unknown repo 'foo' requested from @@]//:bar` into the lockfile, which will cause Bazel to crash on a subsequent attempt to parse the lockfile.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it so that we throw an error at the time of writing the lockfile, instead of writing a corrupted lockfile that users can't recover from unless they manually delete it. In the unlikely event that we do have a corrupted lockfile, we also no longer crash, but give a helpful error message instead.\r\n\r\nFixes
