This elicits this behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_JAVA_OPTIONS=--wtf bazel version  # Works, with an warning message\r\nJDK_JAVA_OPTIONS=--wtf bazel version  # crashes\r\nJAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=--wtf bazel version  # crashes\r\n```\r\n\r\n`_JAVA_OPTIONS` was special-cased in 2012 before Bazel was open source.\r\n\r\nWe should treat these command line options consistently.\r\n\r\nGoing a bit further, maybe it's worth purging the environment of the JVM running Bazel?
