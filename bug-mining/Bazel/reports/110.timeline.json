one could add a feature that disables the addition of `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY`, that could end up breaking rulesets and tools from third parties that rely on runfiles libraries and thus this variable. That doesn't sound like a great feature to have since the problem is clearly unrelated to this particular variable.\r\n\r\nAlternatives I see:\r\n1. Use a custom Bazel binary until this is fixed in the compiler. This isn't difficult, you just have to modify the line https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/a3c677dfea2de636a719d50345a5a97af96fae60/src/main/starlark/builtins_bzl/common/cc/cc_helper.bzl#L971 and then build `bazel build -c opt //src:bazel`. The C++ rules don't exist outside the Bazel binary yet, otherwise you could just load a custom version of `rules_cc`.\r\n2. In your C/C++ toolchain, wrap the compiler into a binary or shell script that fixes up the param file before invoking the compiler with it (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/apple_support/blob/master/crosstool/wrapped_clang.cc for an example that used to be part of Bazel itself).\r\n3. If this quoting style is common enough and not just a bug, maybe support for it could be added to the C++ rules.\r\n\r\nWould any of that work for you?\r\n\r\nCC @buildbreaker2021 who might have more

While one could add a feature that disables the addition of `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY`, that could end up breaking rulesets and tools from third parties that rely on runfiles libraries and thus this variable. That doesn't sound like a great feature to have since the problem is clearly unrelated to this particular variable.\r\n\r\nYes, I agree with all this. However, since my team is developing an embedded application, we do not rely on runfiles, so disabling this _should_ not effect our implementation, but I do understand the thought here.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Alternatives I see:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Use a custom Bazel binary until this is fixed in the compiler. This isn't difficult, you just have to modify the line https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/a3c677dfea2de636a719d50345a5a97af96fae60/src/main/starlark/builtins_bzl/common/cc/cc_helper.bzl#L971\r\n>     and then build `bazel build -c opt //src:bazel`. The C++ rules don't exist outside the Bazel binary yet, otherwise you could just load a custom version of `rules_cc`.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the \"quick\" solution that I will implement if I can't get the command line length down below where a param file is required.\r\n\r\n> 2. In your C/C++ toolchain, wrap the compiler into a binary or shell script that fixes up the param file before invoking the compiler with it (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/apple_support/blob/master/crosstool/wrapped_clang.cc for an example that used to be part of Bazel itself).\r\n\r\nAnd this will be the longer term solution we will target if needed.\r\n\r\n> 3. If this quoting style is common enough and not just a bug, maybe support for it could be added to the C++ rules.\r\n\r\nEvaluating our other compilers, it seems that this quoting is unique to one, so I don't think option 3 is the right path for Bazel to take.\r\n\r\n\r\n> In my original proposal for runfiles handling, I proposed to add the define only to targets that directly depend on the runfiles library in `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles`. I could see that being a better solution than introducing a feature.\r\n> \r\n> @buildbreaker2021 What do you think? It would be a slightly incompatible change.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think this is a more correct solution, which would also fix my
