A tool used in Android compilation depends on the current Android SDK, which cannot be discovered for tools (which are built in an exec configuration).\r\n\r\nThe [`android_binary`] rule, even with rules_android, is still [the native version](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/rules/android/BazelAndroidBinaryRule.java). This currently defines an attribute, [`$build_java8_legacy_dex`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/android/AndroidRuleClasses.java;drc=0356a3ff1d978fe645f71a546680bd89391466dc;l=696), which uses the exec transition and depends on [`@bazel_tools////tools/android:build_java8_legacy_dex`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:tools/android/BUILD.tools;drc=7c1b139fc0a26b69131b62a019dac3ce9d31082d;l=202).\r\n\r\n`build_java8_legacy_dex` is an `sh_binary`, so it's correct that this dependency uses the exec transition: it's a tool which is executed in a build action. However, this transitively depends on [`@bazel_tools//tools/android:android_jar`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:tools/android/BUILD.tools;drc=7c1b139fc0a26b69131b62a019dac3ce9d31082d;l=14), which is implemented by the [`android_tools_defaults_jar`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/rules/android/BazelAndroidToolsDefaultsJarRule.java).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `android_tools_defaults_jar` is used to depend on the Android SDK, which cannot be found via toolchain resolution in the exec configuration.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this dependency is actually unused: adding a dummy SDK (like the dummy SDK currently added for the native `android_sdk_repository`) is sufficient to allow the build to complete. Alternately, we could try to remove the dependency if it is unused.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate: clone https://github.com/katre/rules_android/tree/show-atdj\r\n```\r\n$ cd examples/basicapp\r\n$ USE_BAZEL_VERSION=last_green bazelisk build --fat_apk_cpu=arm64-v8a //java/com/basicapp:basic_app \r\n2023/09/22 15:27:33 Using unreleased version at commit 48b2e857ebd2c0ca6835b2f2252b58a773d8a7c9\r\nERROR: /usr/local/google/home/jcater/repos/rules_android/examples/basicapp/java/com/basicapp/BUILD:3:15: While resolving toolchains for target //java/com/basicapp:basic_app: No matching toolchains found for types @bazel_tools//tools/android:sdk_toolchain_type.\r\nTo debug, rerun with --toolchain_resolution_debug='@bazel_tools//tools/android:sdk_toolchain_type'\r\nIf platforms or toolchains are a new concept for you, we'd encourage reading https://bazel.build/concepts/platforms-intro.\r\nWARNING: errors encountered while analyzing target '//java/com/basicapp:basic_app': it will not be built\r\nINFO: Analyzed target //java/com/basicapp:basic_app (42 packages loaded, 246 targets configured).\r\nINFO: Found 0 targets...\r\nERROR: command succeeded, but not all targets were analyzed\r\nINFO: Elapsed time: 1.069s, Critical Path: 0.01s\r\nINFO: 1 process: 1 internal.\r\nERROR: Build did NOT complete successfully\r\n$ USE_BAZEL_VERSION=last_green bazel query --experimental_google_legacy_api --output=label_kind -- 'somepath(//java/com/basicapp:basic_app, @bazel_tools//tools/android:android_jar)'\r\n2023/09/22 15:27:58 Using unreleased version at commit 48b2e857ebd2c0ca6835b2f2252b58a773d8a7c9\r\nandroid_binary rule //java/com/basicapp:basic_app\r\nsh_binary rule @bazel_tools//tools/android:build_java8_legacy_dex\r\nfilegroup rule @bazel_tools//tools/android:desugared_java8_legacy_libs\r\ngenerated file @bazel_tools//tools/android:desugared_java8_legacy_libs.jar\r\ngenrule rule @bazel_tools//tools/android:desugar_java8_legacy_libs\r\nandroid_tools_defaults_jar rule @bazel_tools//tools/android:android_jar\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
