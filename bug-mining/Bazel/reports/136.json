The `abseil/abseil-cpp` example currently fails to build as is. This is not a big deal per se, but adding a step to checkout a release tag which is known to build would be useful to ensure the tutorial is functional.\r\n2. The current docker build of the `latest` tag (bazel 6.2.1) no longer includes `python2` nor `clang`, the \"Explore the Bazel container\" section should therefore be updated to reflect that.\n\n### Where do you see this issue? (include link to specific section of the page, if applicable)\n\n\n- https://bazel.build/install/docker-container#build-abseil-inside-container\r\n- https://bazel.build/install/docker-container#explore-bazel-container\n\n### Any other information you'd like to share?\n\nI may be able to make a pull request for this soon.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18975/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
