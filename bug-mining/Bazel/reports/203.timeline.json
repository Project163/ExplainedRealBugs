the bug go away if you use `--noenable_runfiles` instead of `--nobuild_runfile_links`?\r\n\r\nThis is admittedly very confusing, but `--noenable_runfiles` means \"no runfile symlinks are created ever\", while `--nobuild_runfilke_links` means \"no runfile symlinks are created when the binary is built, but they'll be created just in time before the binary is executed (as a build action, bazel test or bazel run)\".

If you build it with `--noenable_runfiles`, it makes no such assumption. (I understand that setting `--noenable_runfiles` is not a viable workaround.)\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure what you mean by here you're invoking the binary directly outside of Bazel but it seems like the way coverage is setup should be to take this java tool as a binary so runfiles are kept.\r\n\r\nYeah, I'm now convinced that there's an actual bug here. Judging from the logs, it looks like the following is happening:\r\n\r\n- `bazel coverage` invokes `collect_coverage.sh`\r\n- `collect_coverage.sh` [assembles](https://source.corp.google.com/h/github/googlesource/codesearch/+/master:bazelbuild/bazel/tools/test/collect_coverage.sh;l=232;drc=48a8d01b05149757f69a6a65a22a280bf003cd24) an `LCOV_MERGER_CMD`, then [invokes](https://source.corp.google.com/h/github/googlesource/codesearch/+/master:bazelbuild/bazel/tools/test/collect_coverage.sh;l=254;drc=48a8d01b05149757f69a6a65a22a280bf003cd24) it\r\n- `LCOV_MERGER_CMD` runs the (previously built?) `.../remote_coverage_tools/Main` binary\r\n- The binary is unable to find its runfiles symlink tree, because it was neither created at build time nor just-in-time\r\n\r\nSo I expect there's some missing logic in the `coverage` command to ensure that the runfiles symlink tree for `.../remote_coverage_tools/Main` has been created before the command runs, if `--nobuild_runfile_links` is set. (For comparison, the local spawn runner does this by [calling](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/exec/local/LocalSpawnRunner.java;l=134;drc=40d6780e2f3342129c8d22075c22b600e27862d9) `RunfilesTreeUpdater#updateRunfiles` before executing the spawn; here it's a bit more involved because the runfiles aren't for the binary that is directly invoked by Bazel, but for a binary that it transitively invokes.)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1861082668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11279620659,"node_id":"RTE_lADOATz7jc556WMpzwAAAAKgUVoz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/11279620659","actor":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-18T17:25:43Z","rename":{"from":"remote_coverage_tools/Main: Cannot locate runfiles directory","to":"remote_coverage_tools/Main cannot locate runfiles directory when building with `--nobuild_runfile_links`"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
