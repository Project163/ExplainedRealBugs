In particular, it doesn't tell you *where* the offending usage occurs.\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n```sh\r\ntouch WORKSPACE\r\necho 'java_library(name=\"a\", deps=[\"//b\"])' > BUILD\r\nmkdir b\r\necho 'java_library(name=\"b\", deps=select({\"//c\": []}))' > b/BUILD\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you run `bazel build :a`, you get the following error message (and nothing else):\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: Analysis of target '//:a' failed; build aborted: no such package 'c': BUILD file not found in any of the following directories. Add a BUILD file to a directory to mark it as a package.\r\n - /Users/wyv/test/another-test/c\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt doesn't tell you that `//c` is being referred to from the file `b/BUILD`. If `:a` has lots of deps, it's nigh impossible to figure out what's wrong.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nmacOS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.1.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
