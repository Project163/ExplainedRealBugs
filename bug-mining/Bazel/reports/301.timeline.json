directory traversal has no guarantees around files&directories that are added after the traversal has started, in particular it's unsafe to\r\n- move `.class` away to `.class.uninstrumented`\r\n- create new `.class` with same name\r\n- continue recursive traversal\r\n\r\nAs it is allowed by POSIX `readdir()` to visit newly-created `.class` again https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/functions/readdir_r.html\r\n> If a file is removed from or added to the directory after the most recent call to opendir() or rewinddir(), whether a subsequent call to readdir_r() returns an entry for that file is unspecified.\r\n\r\nAnd second visit will attempt to instrument already instrumented `.class`, but actually fail on the `move()` step as destination already exists.\r\n\r\nThis does reliably happen on buildbarn remote FUSE workers when running `bazel coverage` for JVM targets\r\n\r\nFixes

Description of the bug:\n\n\nFor large java libraries (those with a large number of classes - unclear if jar size also relevant), `bazel coverage` fails with `FileAlreadyExistsException`. See below. The tests themselves run fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbazel coverage :petstore-tests\r\n...\r\nERROR: /home/vmware/code/git/bd007141-sandbox/bazel/issues/coverage-FileAlreadyExistsException/BUILD.bazel:24:13: Building libpetstore-library.jar (1 source file, 1 source jar) failed: (Exit 1): java failed: error executing Javac command (from target //:petstore-library)\r\n  (cd /home/vmware/.cache/bazel/_bazel_vmware/1a134ebb0e3eb1ab84f7e5bc8cbdaac7/execroot/_main && \\\r\n  exec env - \\\r\n    LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 \\\r\n    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin \\\r\n  external/rules_java~~toolchains~remotejdk21_linux/bin/java '--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.api=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.main=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.model=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.processing=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.resources=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.tree=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.util=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-opens=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.code=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-opens=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.comp=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-opens=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.file=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-opens=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.parser=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED' '--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED' '-Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false' -XX:-CompactStrings -Xlog:disable '-Xlog:all=warning:stderr:uptime,level,tags' -jar external/rules_java~~toolchains~remote_java_tools/java_tools/JavaBuilder_deploy.jar @bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/libpetstore-library.jar-0.params @bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/libpetstore-library.jar-1.params)\r\n# Configuration: 25c6b61d2b490f64bacfcbd8e3b48657aada7aa131f7b07e2420d917097d6690\r\n# Execution platform: @@platforms//host:host\r\njava.nio.file.FileAlreadyExistsException: bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/libpetstore-library.jar-coverage-metadata/com/foo/api/Pets0Api$1.class.uninstrumented\r\n        at java.base/sun.nio.fs.UnixFileSystem.move(UnixFileSystem.java:906)\r\n        at java.base/sun.nio.fs.UnixFileSystemProvider.move(UnixFileSystemProvider.java:309)\r\n        at java.base/java.nio.file.Files.move(Files.java:1430)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.buildjar.instrumentation.JacocoInstrumentationProcessor$1.visitFile(JacocoInstrumentationProcessor.java:136)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.buildjar.instrumentation.JacocoInstrumentationProcessor$1.visitFile(JacocoInstrumentationProcessor.java:113)\r\n        at java.base/java.nio.file.Files.walkFileTree(Files.java:2786)\r\n        at java.base/java.nio.file.Files.walkFileTree(Files.java:2857)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.buildjar.instrumentation.JacocoInstrumentationProcessor.instrumentRecursively(JacocoInstrumentationProcessor.java:111)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.buildjar.instrumentation.JacocoInstrumentationProcessor.processRequest(JacocoInstrumentationProcessor.java:85)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.buildjar.SimpleJavaLibraryBuilder.buildJar(SimpleJavaLibraryBuilder.java:151)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.buildjar.SimpleJavaLibraryBuilder.run(SimpleJavaLibraryBuilder.java:120)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.buildjar.BazelJavaBuilder.build(BazelJavaBuilder.java:111)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.buildjar.BazelJavaBuilder.parseAndBuild(BazelJavaBuilder.java:91)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.buildjar.BazelJavaBuilder.lambda$main$0(BazelJavaBuilder.java:52)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.lib.worker.WorkRequestHandler$WorkRequestCallback.apply(WorkRequestHandler.java:252)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.lib.worker.WorkRequestHandler.respondToRequest(WorkRequestHandler.java:480)\r\n        at com.google.devtools.build.lib.worker.WorkRequestHandler.lambda$startResponseThread$1(WorkRequestHandler.java:433)\r\n        at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1583)Target //:petstore-tests failed to build\r\nINFO: Elapsed time: 2.005s, Critical Path: 1.94s\r\nINFO: 2 processes: 2 internal.\r\nERROR: Build did NOT complete successfully\r\n//:petstore-tests                                               FAILED TO BUILD\r\n```\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n* Linux (tested on Rocky 9.4 x86) (This does not repro on mac x86)\r\n* extract attached archive\r\n[bazel-coverage-FileAlreadyExistsException.tar.gz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18325184/bazel-coverage-FileAlreadyExistsException.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n* generate a swagger spec with
