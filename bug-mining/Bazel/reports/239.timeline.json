Description of the bug:\n\n\nPrior to upgrading to  bazel 6.0.0, on a setup with remote execution, with `bazel test --remote_download_toplevel --nozip_undeclared_test_outputs` I'd see `test.outputs` populated with files. \r\nOn bazel 6.0.0, `test.outputs` is always empty on passing tests.\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nWith remote execution, run `bazel test --remote_download_toplevel --nozip_undeclared_test_outputs`. Observe that test.outputs is empty on passing tests.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.0.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nIf I remove `--nozip_undeclared_test_outputs`, I see `test.outputs/outputs.zip` on passing tests too\r\nIf I remove `--remote_download_toplevel`, I see the desired files in `test.outputs/*` on passing tests too\r\n\r\nAdding `--experimental_remote_download_regex=\".*\"` didn't
