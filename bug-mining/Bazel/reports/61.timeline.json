is achieved by the following related changes:\r\n\r\n1) Moving the `additional_linker_inputs` attribute up from the `cc_binary_base` rule to the `cc_rule`. The rationale here is that any rule that allows `linkopts` to be set should also support `additional_linker_inputs`.\r\n\r\n2) Adding the `additional_linker_inputs` attr to the `cc_library` rule context. This was copied verbatim from the existing `cc_binary` attribute list.\r\n\r\n3) Appending the `ctx.files.additional_linker_inputs` list to the list of linker scripts wherever they are passed as `additional_inputs` in the `cc_library.bzl` builtin file corresponding to the `cc_library` rule.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nFor context on this PR, see issue #17788 as well as the original [Google group discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/bazel-discuss/c/1VFvNBDqzVU/m/F5UmYO-RAAAJ), which inspired the feature request.\r\n\r\nResolves

is achieved by the following related changes:\r\n\r\n1) Moving the `additional_linker_inputs` attribute up from the `cc_binary_base` rule to the `cc_rule`. The rationale here is that any rule that allows `linkopts` to be set should also support `additional_linker_inputs`.\r\n\r\n2) Adding the `additional_linker_inputs` attr to the `cc_library` rule context. This was copied verbatim from the existing `cc_binary` attribute list.\r\n\r\n3) Appending the `ctx.files.additional_linker_inputs` list to the list of linker scripts wherever they are passed as `additional_inputs` in the `cc_library.bzl` builtin file corresponding to the `cc_library` rule.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nFor context on this PR, see issue #17788 as well as the original [Google group discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/bazel-discuss/c/1VFvNBDqzVU/m/F5UmYO-RAAAJ), which inspired the feature request.\r\n\r\nResolves #17788.\r\n\r\nCloses #18952.\r\n\r\nCommit https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/05899953a1726328b0ff9d940720e363260ce5c4\r\n\r\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 557505297\r\nChange-Id: I4811b60e102c6426697efcb202296fe77a3d5f25","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10162012603,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc5g7AkAzwAAAAJdtAG7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10162012603","actor":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c58fea100c84d00b321101c81a9d0e4c2cb56329","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/c58fea100c84d00b321101c81a9d0e4c2cb56329","created_at":"2023-08-22T18:50:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1728420948","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17788#issuecomment-1728420948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17788","id":1728420948,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5nBZxU","user":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-20T21:02:24Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T21:02:24Z","body":"A fix for this issue has been included in [Bazel 6.4.0 RC1](https://releases.bazel.build/6.4.0/rc1/index.html).
