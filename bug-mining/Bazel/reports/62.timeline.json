Can you also reproduce this if you change `--output_user_root` within the same project or is this specific to two different projects sharing an `--output_user_root`?\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay. You may have already tried this given there is an open PR. I just tried and I believe it needs to be \"two different projects sharing an `--output_user_root`\" in order to reproduce. I added a new script to my repro repo (bazel_repro_same_directory.sh) so you can see what I tried, where I only use a single repo but do 2 different builds using different `--output_user_roots`. Both times I see the same absolute path to the file in the runfiles manifest. I think this makes sense though? Even if we are reproducing the issue I have outlined here, the absolute path to the file would not have changed, so I would expect the path to be the same.
