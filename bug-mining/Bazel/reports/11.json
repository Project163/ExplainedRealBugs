This is because it depends on workspace being set, and workspace is only set [when `RUN_UNDER_RUNFILES` is set](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/9d0163002ca63f4cdbaff9420380d72e2a6e38b3#diff-fa3ae340fea197099f8d4b5101d1d71bccc3ceece3517b4ea9126e2d448eab01R501-R507). This is a regression from the previous behavior where the directory placed in `/tmp` would be deleted as long as it was [running under a zip](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/9d0163002ca63f4cdbaff9420380d72e2a6e38b3#diff-fa3ae340fea197099f8d4b5101d1d71bccc3ceece3517b4ea9126e2d448eab01L296-L303). This should be fixed so that the `Bazel.runfiles_*` directories are cleaned up whenever it is running under a zip.\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nBuild a zipapp target on Bazel 6.0.0 (without `RUN_UNDER_RUNFILES` set) and on whatever machine you consume that zipapp there will be a `Bazel.runfiles_<sha>` directory with the zipapp contents left around from execution.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.0.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
