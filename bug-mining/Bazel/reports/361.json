Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n1. Build Bazel from the source code with static C++ runtime linking:\n`bazel.exe build --compilation_mode=opt //src:bazel.exe -s --stamp --embed_label=8.3.1-000 --features=static_link_msvcrt`\n2. Ensure that Bazel server is not running:\n`bazel.exe --client_debug shutdown`\n3. Build any target with `--client_debug` option:\n`bazel.exe --client_debug build //examples/windows/dll:hellolib`\n\nThe output of last command:\n```\n[INFO 18:17:40.539 src/main/cpp/rc_file.cc:62] Parsing the RcFile c:\\github\\bazelbuild/.bazelrc\n[INFO 18:17:40.540 src/main/cpp/rc_file.cc:126] Skipped optional import of %workspace%/user.bazelrc, the specified rc file either does not exist oris not readable.\n[INFO 18:17:40.541 src/main/cpp/blaze_util_windows.cc:1457] python.exe found on PATH: C:\\tools\\Python311\\python.exe\n[INFO 18:17:40.541 src/main/cpp/blaze.cc:1649] Debug logging requested, sending all client log statements to stderr\n[INFO 18:17:40.542 src/main/cpp/blaze.cc:1652] Running (pid=31384)\n[INFO 18:17:40.544 src/main/cpp/blaze.cc:1510] Acquired the client lock, waited 0 milliseconds\n[USER 18:17:41.469 src/main/cpp/blaze.cc:958] Starting local Bazel server (8.3.1-000) and connecting to it...\n\n```\nAt this point Bazel exits without building the target.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nWindows\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\nThe issue was found on version 8.3.1 and is reproducible on latest master. It has not been observed on 7.6.1.\nVery likely, the problem is related to this commit:\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/1744d45c0c57af23f631c2145e8af4b185dca77f\n\n\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nDebugging showed that crash happens at this point:\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/1967cb02e7c77263c5bdbb89cc1e0fcacf0a7409/src/main/cpp/blaze.cc#L1315\nbecause the value of `environ` at line above is NULL. Also, we have found that `environ` is always NULL, from start of program and until this point.\nBut in case when we do not specify `--client_debug` option, the value of `environ` became valid at this point:\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/e3802cfa72433649b5d695b2011a355fcae4c745/src/main/cpp/blaze_util.cc#L247\n\nI believe that origin of the issue is using a `wmain` function on Windows instead of `main`. According to [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/using-wmain?view=msvc-170):\n`Similarly, if your program uses a wmain function, a wide-character environment is created at program startup and is pointed to by the _wenviron global variable. An MBCS (ASCII) environment is created on the first call to _putenv or getenv, and is pointed to by the _environ global variable.`\nSo, an ASCII environment is not initially created until the `getenv()` call somewhere inside `absl::InitializeLog()`.\n\nThe workaround is placing a dummy `getenv()` call in `wmain` function. This resolves the issue.\nHowever, I believe you might prefer to use a wide-character version of environment with `_wenviron` global variable.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26948/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26948/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
