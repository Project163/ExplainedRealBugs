is trivial to repro. The issue is this [logic](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/exec/StandaloneTestStrategy.java;l=819;drc=874a050aa7ab3f2034bbd4afb3a5fbf4ed5109d1) in StandaloneTestStrategy that appends the test stderr file into the stdout file and then deletes the former. With `--experimental_remote_cache_async`, this logic runs concurrently with the uploading of the test spawn, and might find that the stderr file has already been deleted.\r\n\r\nThis is an instance of a more general problem that, in order for async uploading to work correctly, we must uphold the invariant that the outputs of a spawn must never be deleted for the remainder of the execution (or at least until uploading has taken place).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2147298305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2147408587","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22501#issuecomment-2147408587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22501","id":2147408587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5__trL","user":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-04T12:26:06Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T12:26:06Z","body":"In addition, the `test.err` files are guaranteed to always be empty, because `test-setup.sh` [redirects](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:tools/test/test-setup.sh;l=18;drc=8e639dfa8c7aa0723123ee90dc933d528a4f2b68) stderr to stdout.

an action may modify a spawn's outputs after execution, the upload of outputs to the cache and reuse for deduplicated actions need to happen synchronously directly after spawn execution to avoid a race.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements this for cache uploads by marking all actions with this property and simply disabling async upload for all spawns executed by such actions.\r\n\r\nFor output reuse, all executions deduplicated against the first one register atomically upon deduplication and cause the cache upload to wait for all of them to complete reuse. \r\n\r\nFixes #22501\r\nFixes #23288
