Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nCreate a VS (2015 or greater) project and check Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Command Line.  `/Zc:inline` is set.\r\n \r\n or alternatively\r\n \r\n Use the VS generator with a CMake project and open the generated vcproj file in VS.  The same flag is set.\r\n \r\n Now create a cc_library and `bazel build -S //...`.
