Description of the bug:\n\n\nOur build uses JDK 8 to run tools and build binaries.  Bazel itself and a sizeable amount of the precompiled tools are compiled using JDK 11, however, the Bazel java_tools are compiled with JDK 8 and work fine in our setup.\r\n\r\nThe `remote_coverage_tools` binaries, however, are precompiled using JDK 11, resulting in the following stacktrace in our setup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: A JNI error has occurred, please check your installation and try again\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/google/devtools/coverageoutputgenerator/Main has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0\r\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)\r\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:757)\r\n        at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:142)\r\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(URLClassLoader.java:468)\r\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader.access$100(URLClassLoader.java:74)\r\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:369)\r\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:363)\r\n        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\r\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:362)\r\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:419)\r\n        at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:365)\r\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:352)\r\n        at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(LauncherHelper.java:601)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo maintain JDK 8 compatibility (if desired), it would seem that the remote_coverage_tools should be built targeting JDK 8, or the sources made available as a part of the Bazel binary distribution\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nIn Bazel itself:\r\n\r\n```bazel coverage --java_language_version=8 --tool_java_language_version=8 --java_runtime_version=8 --tool_java_runtime_version=8  //src/tools/singlejar:output_jar_simple_test```\r\n\r\nWill have this stack trace in the logs.\r\n\r\nThe build fails with JDK 8 in recent 7.0.0-pre builds due to (apparently) incompatible changes.  A different example may needed for that purpose.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux, Alma 9 (RHEL-like), arm64\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.1.0rc1 (also reproduces with 6.0.0)\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17165 refers to use of the java 11 runner to build against java 8 targets.  We are using Java 8 everywhere.\r\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17568 is python-specific\r\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17458 is specific to the runfiles library\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1536631615","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17458#issuecomment-1536631615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17458","id":1536631615,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5blyM_","user":{"login":"pete-gillin-privitar","id":69794439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk0NDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69794439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar","html_url":"https://github.com/pete-gillin-privitar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-gillin-privitar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-05T18:37:51Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T18:37:51Z","body":"I'm seeing this issue with bazel 6.1.2.
