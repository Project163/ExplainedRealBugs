Description of the bug:\n\n\nWhile running a build our Artifactory HTTP cache timed out for a request. Obviously we're looking at why it did that but we expected Bazel to fall back to running the action locally and instead it failed the build\r\n`\r\nERROR: /<workspace path>/BUILD:1802:10: Compiling <source file>.c failed: unable to finalize action: Download of '/<artifactory repo path>/cas/b8f31e5fda95495273a86cc5c7395298eb321490395ca90815a9184f2a9ec980' timed out. Received 0 bytes.\r\n`\r\n\r\nThe documentation suggests `--remote_local_fallback` only applies to remote execution but some comments on the bug tracker suggested it might also apply to remote caching so we tried that but still saw the issue.\r\n\r\nI can try to recreate the issue but it's not totally trivial as I'll need to setup an HTTP server that can deliberately time out. So thought I'd check if this is expected behavior or if perhaps there is a trivially obvious bug to someone who knows the Bazel source.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nNot trivial to reproduce! I can work on that if it would be useful.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux - RHEL 8\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 7.0.0-pre.20231011.2- (@non-git)\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\nBuilt from the 7.0.0-pre.20231011.2 release tag.\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nNo\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No

Description of the bug:\n\n\nSince upgrading to Bazel 7, we've encountered numerous sporadic build failures. Most are covered by other GitHub issues, but AFAICT nobody's filed one about .jdeps files.\r\n\r\nI am going to experiment with `--noexperimental_inmemory_jdeps_files`.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nUnknown.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 7.2.0-vmware\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\nThis is just Bazel 7.2.0 with a handful of patches for PRs that are either outstanding or have been rejected. None are related to scheduling, remote caching, etc.\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20161\r\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22387\r\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22127\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nOur RBE implementation is Buildfarm.\r\n\r\n- I haven't ruled out the possibility that Buildfarm is misbehaving. However,\r\n    - We didn't run into failures like this when still on 6.4.0.\r\n    - I was hoping that the retry flags specified below would allow us to recover from transfer failures.\r\n- Only RBE workers are allowed to write to Buildfarm's CAS (`--noremote_upload_local_results`).\r\n    - Is this flag inherently incompatible w/ `experimental_inmemory_foo` flags?\r\n    - We're using dynamic execution. If the flags are incompatible, then is it possible that dynamic execution contributes to the nondeterministic nature of the failures?\r\n\r\nWe're using the following options:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# RBE-related flags\r\n--remote_download_outputs=all\r\n--internal_spawn_scheduler\r\n--spawn_strategy=dynamic\r\n--dynamic_local_strategy=worker,sandboxed,local\r\n--remote_retries=5\r\n--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=5\r\n--verbose_failures\r\n--remote_cache=\r\n--disk_cache=\r\n--noremote_upload_local_results\r\n--experimental_remote_cache_async\r\n--experimental_remote_merkle_tree_cache\r\n--remote_local_fallback\r\n--remote_local_fallback_strategy=sandboxed\r\n--experimental_remote_downloader_local_fallback\r\n--remote_cache_compression\r\n\r\n# Workaround for https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22387 .\r\nbuild --noexperimental_inmemory_dotd_files\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn failing builds w/ this syndrome, `java.log` contains backtraces resembling the following\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.google.devtools.build.lib.remote.common.BulkTransferException: Missing digest: HASH/LEN for LABEL.jdeps\r\n        at
