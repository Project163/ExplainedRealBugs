target.toFile().isDirectory()) {\r\n-        WindowsFileOperations.createJunction(link.toString(), target.toString());\r\n+      if (createSymbolicLinks) {\r\n+

There's no hope for the other case; junctions are inherently different from symlinks (junctions can only point to directories, and they are always absolute), creating a dangling junction instead of a dangling symlink was just enough to fix https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2474 (in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/6c07525462062d491816a66a94c3db3b2dbc8f98).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2197258612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"laszlocsomor","id":10532244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTMyMjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10532244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor","html_url":"https://github.com/laszlocsomor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laszlocsomor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13347605691,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6C_8f0zwAAAAMblEy7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13347605691","actor":{"login":"luke-flow","id":173067581,"node_id":"U_kgDOClDNPQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173067581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/luke-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b07ccb500dcad4bb82f4d7860e5b118b08bd19ee","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luke-flow/rules_go/commits/b07ccb500dcad4bb82f4d7860e5b118b08bd19ee","created_at":"2024-07-01T08:43:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"luke-flow","id":173067581,"node_id":"U_kgDOClDNPQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173067581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/luke-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luke-flow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-01T08:52:04Z","updated_at":"2024-07-01T08:52:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_go/issues/3976","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_go","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_go/issues/3976/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_go/issues/3976/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-contrib/rules_go/issues/3976/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/issues/3976","id":2383242635,"node_id":"I_kwDOAzdJo86ODWWL","number":3976,"title":"Windows symlinked binaries are unreliable with remote cache enabled.

As Laszlo points out above, we could make it work for the `--windows_enable_symlinks` case, but that's not a complete solution since not everyone is able or willing to set this flag (it requires administrator privileges).\r\n\r\nPossible solutions, in rough order of complexity:\r\n\r\n1. Always fall back to making a copy on Windows if the symlink target doesn't exist.\r\n2. Disable \"building without the bytes\" for symlink artifacts (i.e., the target of the symlink is always downloaded, even with `--remote_download_minimal`. This must happen transitively since symlinks can point to other symlinks.\r\n3. Plant a dangling junction initially, but replace it with a symlink or copy when the target is later downloaded (might be too complex).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2240168882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-19T21:25:50Z","updated_at":"2024-07-19T21:25:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19018","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19018/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19018/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19018/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19018","id":1816103755,"node_id":"I_kwDOATz7jc5sP4tL","number":19018,"title":"Race condition creating symlinks on Windows results in a junction to empty directory being created instead of a symlink to a file","user":{"login":"carpenterjc","id":3050626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTA2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc","html_url":"https://github.com/carpenterjc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpenterjc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":106503259,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDY1MDMyNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/type:%20bug","name":"type: bug","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":192364241,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTIzNjQyNDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/P3","name":"P3","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"We're not considering working on this, but happy to review a PR.

Description of the bug:\n\n\nWhile using a `cc_import` to add a dependency to a `cc_binary` that is produced by a custom starlark rule elsewhere in the repository.\r\n\r\nThis executable is then use by and run by a `cc_test`. \r\n\r\nWhat we find is rarely bazel will create \"symlink\" the file before it is written by the custom rule. When this happens bazel will create a directory junction instead of a symlink to the file. \r\n\r\nSometimes what is supposed to be a symlink (or copy, if symlinks are disabled) shows up as a directory junction instead (this breaks -- you cannot interact with a directory junction which points at a file)\r\nWhen you're in this state, bazel build doesn't fix the problem. Only a bazel clean or manually removing the junction fixes it.\r\nIt appears to be a race condition, because it doesn't happen consistently.\r\nCode inspection of the bazel symlink implementation for Windows shows that it creates a directory junction either if the target exists and is a directory, or if the target doesn't exist -- even if symlinks are disabled on Windows.\r\nThis implies the bug: if the core.symlink action is scheduled ahead of the action which generates the link target, it will always produce the wrong result on Windows.\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nThis happens rarely and we believe its a race condition.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nWindows 11\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.2.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?
