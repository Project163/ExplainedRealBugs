Probably that shouldn't be allowed.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nRules API\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\ndef.bzl:\n\n```starlark\ndef _foo_impl(ctx):\n    ctx.file(\"BUILD.bazel\", 'exports_files([\"foo.txt\"])')\n    ctx.file(\"foo.txt\", \"hello world\")\n\n_foo = repository_rule(implementation = _foo_impl)\n```\n\nMODULE.bazel:\n\n```starlark\nfoo = use_repo_rule(\"//:def.bzl\", \"_foo\")\nfoo(name = \"foo\")\n```\n\nBUILD.bazel:\n\n```starlark\ngenrule(\n    name = \"bar\",\n    srcs = [\"@foo//:foo.txt\"],\n    outs = [\"bar.txt\"],\n    cmd = \"cp $< $@\",\n)\n```\n\nBuilding this repository will succeed even though the `_foo` repository rule is private (and Buildifier complains that it's unused).\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nmacOS 15.3.1\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.1.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nSearched these places for \"use_repo_rule\", didn't find anything relevant\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
