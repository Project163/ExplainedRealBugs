The rationale was that we don't want to have to evaluate `foo` just to decide whether or not `foo_input` is in fact an `InputFile`.\r\n\r\nBut this restriction means that the common idiom:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbzl_library(\r\n    name = \"foo\",\r\n    srcs = [\"foo.bzl\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nblocks `bzl_library` from being a symbolic macro (e.g. wrapping the underlying rule). We believe this will be a common blocker well beyond this one example.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we will now only block the implicit creation of input files when they collide exactly with a target or macro, and not when they merely fall within a macro's namespace.\r\n\r\nA consequence of this design change is that it complicates how input files are handled when we have lazy macro evaluation. But we'll deal with that when the time comes.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24064/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
