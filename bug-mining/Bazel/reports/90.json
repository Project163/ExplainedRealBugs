This causes problems when you need to make an binary that uses a runfiles libraries runnable outside of Bazel e.g. in an container or if you just want to package the binary in some way.\r\n\r\nTo make the binary runnable outside of bazel the `.repo_mapping` file is required so that runfiles lookups don't fail. That means that there needs to be an way to either generate or copy the `.repo_mapping` file in starlark so that e.g. a tar rule can list the repo mapping file in it's inputs.\r\n\r\nThere is currently an workaround for this for Python zip that is not available to others: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/4e60992432a49dda255eb005544ae8c03b30e243#diff-06b3fa5571583c2c73ec269859f1b9194038c26cc6c0e9c8897f53b992731658R382\r\n\r\nThis API could be publicly exposed or if it's possible the repo mapping could be exposed on the `FilesToRunProvider` like the runfiles manifest is exposed today.\r\n\r\nTagging @fmeum and @Wyverald since there is some context in a couple of Slack threads that they were part of:\r\nhttps://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/C014RARENH0/p1698153613312699\r\nhttps://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/CA3NW13MH/p1697050350018059?thread_ts=1697034827.979009&cid=CA3NW13MH\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\n\r\nRules API\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19937/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
