Is this something that can be added as a secondary option for that platform, or is there something special about `/private/var/tmp` as an output root? \n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nA similar issue as interrogated with #16937, but for macOS instead of just Linux.\n\n### Which operating
