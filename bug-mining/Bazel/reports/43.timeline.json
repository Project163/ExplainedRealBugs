It's that damn `platforms` repo again...\r\n\r\nWhen you don't enable Bzlmod, `@platforms` for everyone is the `@@platforms` repo defined in a WORKSPACE prefix/suffix (don't remember which). All good.\r\n\r\nWhen you enable Bzlmod, `@platforms` is still the `@@platforms` repo defined in a WORKSPACE prefix/suffix for everything that is *not* in the Bzlmod system (i.e. all the WORKSPACE repos including `@@rules_nodejs`). However, for things in the Bzlmod system (i.e. only built-in modules like `bazel_tools` and `local_config_platform` because your MODULE.bazel file is empty), `@platforms` actually refers to `@@platforms~0.0.5`. This is important because when we search for an appropriate execution platform (most likely your host machine), `@local_config_platform//:host` actually uses the platforms defined in `@@platforms~0.0.5`, but `rules_nodejs` defines toolchains for platforms defined in `@@platforms`.\r\n\r\nThe immediate workaround would be to add a single line in your MODULE.bazel file (`bazel_dep(name=\"platforms\", version=\"0.0.5\")`).

possible.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1438406403/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8570480356,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOATz7jc5ceW3EzwAAAAH-1ybk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/8570480356","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-21T12:35:18Z","label":{"name":"untriaged","color":"c34ddd"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8570480369,"node_id":"LE_lADOATz7jc5ceW3EzwAAAAH-1ybx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/8570480369","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-21T12:35:18Z","label":{"name":"P2","color":"e99695"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"seh","id":175841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTg0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh","html_url":"https://github.com/seh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-02T15:55:20Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T15:55:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17655","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17655/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17655/

related to #17289, when I try to use [_rules_oci_'s `oci_image` rule](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_oci/blob/main/docs/image.md#oci_image) in a root module (that is, in a Bazel workspace with a _MODULE.bazel_ file and with the `--enable_bzlmod` flag active), building the target fails due to Bazel claiming that there is no repository named \"platforms\" defined:\r\n```\r\nbazel build

\"platforms\" module's repository explicitly anywhere in my code and remove that entry from my _MODULE.bazel_ file, then Bazel fails differently, though this is not the root of my complaint

easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease find [attached here an archive of a Bazel repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/files/10873027/bzlmod-platforms-test.tar.gz), with a root module named \"bzlmod_platforms_test.\" In the _WORKSPACE.bzlmod_ file, it uses _rules_oci_'s `oci_pull` rule to pull an OCI image from the _distroless_ project.\r\n\r\nIn the \"test\" package, there's a tiny shell program named _greet.sh_, packaged into a tar archive by _pkg_tar_, and then used as the content of an OCI image in the \"image\" target by way of the `oci_image` rule.\r\n\r\nUnpack that archive, and attempt to build the \"test:image\" target.\r\n```shell\r\ntar zxf bzlmod-platforms-test.tar.gz\r\ncd bzlmod-platforms-test\r\nbazel build //test:image\r\n``` \r\nObserve that the build fails for lack of the \"platforms\" repository (nominated in the error message as \"@platforms\").\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nmacOS 13.2.1\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 6.0.0\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nThe use of _rules_oci_ and _pkg_tar_ is based mostly on @alexeagle's bazel-contrib/rules_oci#77, simplified here to show that I'm not even using the \"platforms\" module explicitly in my own code. In the real repository in which this problem arose, I _am_ using that module explicitly in various places, but I wanted to show that I was unable to use _pkg_tar_ and _rules_oci_ together both with and without a dependency on the \"platforms\" module. In other words, while the error message makes it _look_ like I'm missing a dependency, expressing that dependency explicitly doesn't help.\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\n_No
