It was already an error for it to contain a symlink pointing to an absolute path; this flag extends the restriction to relative paths. The error message will look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnsupported symlink 'sym' inside tree artifact 'bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/tree'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to migrate: have the action produce a regular file instead of a symlink, possibly by copying the target file into place.\r\n\r\nRationale: a tree artifact is currently defined to contain only regular files. If a remote action reports back a symlink, it must be resolved locally, which is generally impossible and potentially non-hermetic. Allowing only the hermetic cases (i.e., where resolution doesn't escape the action's inputs and outputs) would additional complexity and have dubious value.\r\n\r\nNote that this is distinct from #16361, which calls for the ability to include *unresolved* symlinks in a tree artifact on an opt-in basis.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
