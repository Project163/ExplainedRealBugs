Some examples are:\r\n- [`StarlarkTransitionCache`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/StarlarkTransitionCache.java?ss=bazel&q=caffeine&start=31)\r\n- [`BuildConfigurationKeyCache`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/producers/BuildConfigurationKeyCache.java?ss=bazel&q=caffeine&start=41)\r\n- [`PlatformMappingValue.parserCache`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/config/PlatformMappingValue.java;drc=0803ad3770155be411a703950502dc71743017bd;l=152?ss=bazel&q=caffeine&start=21)\r\n- [`StarlarkDefinedConfigTransition.ruleTransitionCache`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/StarlarkDefinedConfigTransition.java?q=symbol%3A%5Cbcom.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.StarlarkDefinedConfigTransition.ruleTransitionCache%5Cb%20case%3Ayes)\r\n\r\nEach of these are used to cache expansive computations that may be repeated multiple times in the same build (ie, in one `bazel build` call). Each of these would ideally also persist from build to build in case the same computation is needed across builds.\r\n\r\nWe've also seen several classes of error arising from the files used to determine cache values being changed between builds, but the cache not being invalidated:\r\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22995 - Flags from `platform` weren't re-computed when the underlying BUILD file changed\r\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23097 - Transitions weren't re-computed when the underlying bzl file changed.\r\n\r\nThere may well be more of these.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13636300502,"node_id":"UNE_lADOATz7jc6QuyYlzwAAAAMsyW7W","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13636300502","actor":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unassigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-24T20:58:39Z","assignee":{"login":"sgowroji","id":48122892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTIyODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48122892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji","html_url":"https://github.com/sgowroji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgowroji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13636300514,"node_id":"UNE_lADOATz7jc6QuyYlzwAAAAMsyW7i","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13636300514","actor":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unassigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-24T20:58:39Z","assignee":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13636300531,"node_id":"UNE_lADOATz7jc6QuyYlzwAAAAMsyW7z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13636300531","actor":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328
