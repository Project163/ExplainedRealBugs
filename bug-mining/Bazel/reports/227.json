Otherwise, when using `ctx.actions.run`, prefer the former (i.e., if the tool in question is the `executable` for the action, there's no need to also pass it under `tools`).\r\n\r\nNote that `ctx.executable._my_tool` refers solely to the executable file, but passing it to the `executable` or `tools` argument automatically includes its associated runfiles in the action inputs, **as long as the tool is a direct dependency of the target calling `ctx.actions.run/ctx.actions.run_shell`**. If you want to pass the tool around (e.g., in a returned provider) for other targets to use, you must obtain a `FilesToRunProvider` via `ctx.attr._my_tool[DefaultInfo].files_to_run`, and pass it around instead.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
