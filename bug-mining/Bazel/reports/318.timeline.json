targets observed from Starlark advertise the `DefaultInfo` provider, but internally that provider is split into `FilesProvider`, `FilesToRunProvider` and `RunfilesProvider`. This is confusing to users that use `cquery` to inspect targets using Starlark expressions. This is improved by synthesizing a `DefaultInfo` provider in the same way as during regular analysis. As a result, the `default_runfiles` and `data_runfiles` of a target can now be inspected with `cquery`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25702/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25702/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-26T13:52:09Z","updated_at":"2025-03-26T13:52:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25365","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25365/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25365/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25365/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25365","id":2874671182,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATz7jc6MRhOC","number":25365,"title":"Don't
