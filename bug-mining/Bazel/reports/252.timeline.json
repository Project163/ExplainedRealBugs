Description of the bug:\n\n\nBasic format of the error is: `src/main/tools/linux-sandbox-pid1.cc:320: \"mount(/home/ubuntu/sdmain/logs, /home/ubuntu/sdmain/logs, nullptr, MS_BIND | MS_REC, nullptr)\": Permission denied`\r\n\r\nThis is occurring as root user, and the /home/ubuntu/sdmain/logs is what we've set the $TMPDIR env var to.\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5900, this is an old bug from 2018 in which setting TMPDIR is not compatible with linux-sandbox.cc. (I'm able to comment on the issue, but I can't see how to re-open it after the bot closed it.)\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5900#issuecomment-2257129539\r\n\r\nFor our tests, we've edited the default spawn strategy in our namespace to replace the generic `sandbox` with `processwrapper-sandbox`, but it took us some time to find the above issue. If the underlying incompatibility can't be fixed easily, it would be nice if spawn strategy could see that TMPDIR is set, and not attempt to use the linux-sandbox in that case.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nNot sure what triggers linux-sandbox in general. In our environment, we've been using TMPDIR for many years, and recently upgraded to Bazel 7 and Ubuntu 20 (in that order), with the latter triggering this bug.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nUbuntu 22.04.4 LTS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 7.1.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5900#issuecomment-2257129539\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No
