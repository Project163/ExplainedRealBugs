`mtime` instead of `atime` was an explicit decision, because `atime`:\r\n\r\n1. is more likely to be affected by other programs running on your system\r\n2. is unreliable if you use the `relatime`

updated at least once per day, but the disk cache can churn through a lot of files in the course of a day.\r\n\r\nWhat if we made it so that files in the disk cache are always created with permissions `0666` (readable *and* writable by group/other) so that anyone can set the `mtime` on them?
