error message observed in #26713 is consistent with `FileChannel#open` failing because the given path doesn't exist. This could happen if one Bazel process observed that `!entryDir.isDirectory()`, which is true if the path doesn't exist, and proceeded to delete the path while another process had just created the directory and is now opening the channel. Since the entry dir is never expected to be an existing non-directory unless the cache has been corrupted, this logic can be removed.\r\n\nAnother possible source of `IOException` during normal operation is on an interrupt (such as the user hitting Ctrl+C). Instead, follow Skyframe best practices by surfacing this as an `InterruptedException` instead of a `FileLockInterruptionException`.\n\r\nAlso document that concurrent use on the same path is not supported (it results in an `OverlappingFileLockException` if the lock is already held, regardless of whether that is in shared or exclusive mode) and why the current usages are safe.\r\n\r\nFixes

error message observed in #26713 is consistent with `FileChannel#open` failing because the given path doesn't exist. This could happen if one Bazel process observed that `!entryDir.isDirectory()`, which is true if the path doesn't exist, and proceeded to delete the path while another process had just created the directory and is now opening the channel. Since the entry dir is never expected to be an existing non-directory unless the cache has been corrupted, this logic can be removed.\n\nAnother possible source of `IOException` during normal operation is on an interrupt (such as the user hitting Ctrl+C). Instead, follow Skyframe best practices by surfacing this as an `InterruptedException` instead of a `FileLockInterruptionException`.\n\nAlso document that concurrent use on the same path is not supported (it results in an `OverlappingFileLockException` if the lock is already held, regardless of whether that is in shared or exclusive mode) and why the current usages are safe.\n\nFixes #26713\n\nCloses #26914.\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 805338728\nChange-Id: Ie808ebe6113b935180b93c21679d5398aa168802\n\nCommit https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ca1cbfece457915871cc1398a667422410b4c3fc","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26946/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/3275967663","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26713#issuecomment-3275967663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26713","id":3275967663,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc7DQ0yv","user":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-10T17:55:45Z","updated_at":"2025-09-10T17:55:45Z","body":"@bazel-io fork 8.4.1","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/3275967663/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
