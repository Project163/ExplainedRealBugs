Description of the bug:\n\n\nThis is similar to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20721, but 1) about repository rules rather than module extensions and 2) not a regression in 7.0.0.\r\n\r\nA repository rule isn't refetched when its repo mapping changes, which can result in `Label(...)` calls made in the implementation function to return stale results when canonical repo names change, e.g. during `bazel_dep` version bumps.\r\n\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n\nExternal Dependency\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
