If a target is differently configured multiple times, but any of them output to the same path, the IDE integration will have no way of being able to build those targets (not at the same time mind you, I understand that could result in action conflict errors).\n\nThe integration uses this identifier in a name of an output group to be able to build differently configured versions of the same target (configured via different top-level target transitions or a single 1:N split transition).\n\nAdded bonus of being `ConfiguredTarget.getConfigurationKey()` versus some other hash, is that a user can debug issues with targets by using that hash directly in `cquery`.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nmacOS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.3.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n* https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20051\n* https://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/CDCMRLS23/p1698776360408999\n* https://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/CDCEKVCHY/p1699049142476529\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
