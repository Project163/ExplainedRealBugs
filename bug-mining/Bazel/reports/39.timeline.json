issue tracks the progress towards [Remote Builds without the Bytes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXPoGMhd1wmjc_4fqy-bP0RE3AlHk-IHpMUy0nDZLkU/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-1bw8YMFeUPCeK4lOLWTOBA).\r\n\r\n## Milestones\r\n- [x] **Implement basic support for not downloading intermediate artifacts** (In Bazel 0.25)\r\nThe feature can be enabled by adding the flag `--experimental_remote_download_outputs=minimal` to the remote caching / execution invocation. The feature mostly works, but comes with the limitations stated in the subsequent tasks.\r\n- [x] **Fix local actions that need to fetch remote outputs** (In Bazel 0.25)\r\nWhile Bazel can run most actions remotely there are a few dozen or so action implementations that currently can't. This can be problematic because such actions often require Bazel to download remote files which this change tries to avoid. An example of such an action is the `SymlinkAction`.\r\n- [x] **Implement fetching of top level artifacts** (In Bazel 0.26)\r\nImplement `--experimental_remote_download_outputs=toplevel` as described in the design document.\r\n- [x] **Support downloading unzipped undeclared test outputs**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17884 for details\r\n- [x] **Store per output file metadata in the persistent action cache**\r\nThe persistent action cache stores the state of Bazel's output base. It does not know about remotely stored files. We need to extend it to do so. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8248\r\n- [x] **Builds without the Bytes fails on missing AC result**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10880 for details\r\n- [x] **Support remote cache eviction**\r\nAs detailed in the design document it's possible for Bazel to wrongly think that an output file exists on the remote system because it has been evicted (\"garbage collected\") in the meantime. If a Bazel action then depends on an evicted file there is currently no other way but to fail the build/test. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8250\r\n- [x] **Add up- and download stats to the profiler**\r\nA user should have insight into what is being up/downloaded and why.\r\n- [x] **Be compatible with the Build Event Service local file uploader** (In Bazel 0.28.0)\r\nThis change currently doesn't interact well with the BEP and BES. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8249\r\n- [x] **Don't create a runfiles tree for remote actions**\r\nFor a test that runs remotely we currently create a runfiles tree in the output base with dangling symlinks that's unused. We need to fix the `SymlinkTreeStrategy`.\r\n- [x] Download targets of symlinks in runfiles\r\nSee #18249 for details\r\n- [x] **Support symlinks into tree artifacts**\r\nSee #15678 for details\r\n- [x] **ctx.actions.symlink actions are not constant time**\r\nSee #14125 for details\r\n- [x] **Support unresolved symlinks in action outputs**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13355 for details\r\n- [x] **Do not create runfile trees unnecessarily when building without the bytes**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18580 for details\r\n- [x] **Bazel query silently thrashes the analysis cache when --remote_download_minimal is enabled**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10902 for details\r\n- [x] **Build event file creation fails with symlinks when using --remote_download_minimal**\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11942 for details\r\n- [x] Support for mobile-install command\r\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14523 for details\r\n- [x] **Work seamlessly with IDEs**\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/1922

Description of the problem / feature request:\r\n\r\nUsing bazel 3.1.0, I remotely executed a test that created a file in `TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.  This failed as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexternal/bazel_tools/tools/test/test-setup.sh: line 389: file: command not found\r\nCould not create \"/tmp/worker/shard/operations/49e83fda-5340-46c5-a27d-fa393f7c87ca/bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/testlogs/atg/experimental/user/dws/report/test.outputs/outputs.zip\": zip not found or failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears that (a) `tools/test/test-setup.sh` requires a file(1) command to be present, and that (b) our remote execution environment is minimal enough not to provide one.\r\n\r\nThe relevant fragment of code in test-setup.sh has portability provisions for stat, even handling the case of it not being there at all:\r\n```\r\n    386       # stat has different flags for different systems. -c is supported by GNU,\r\n    387       # and -f by BSD (and thus OSX). Try both.\r\n    388       file_size=\"$(stat -f%z \"$undeclared_output\" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s \"$undeclared_output\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Could not stat $undeclared_output\")\"\r\n    389       file_type=\"$(file -L -b --mime-type \"$undeclared_output\")\"\r\n    390\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if it had similar provisions for file(1) and pretty much all the other external commands it relies on.\r\n\r\n### Feature requests: what underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\r\n\r\nI would like to remove obstacles to obtaining additional data from the remote execution of tests using bazel.\r\n\r\nIf the remote test execution mechanism could work without any system commands being present, that would be excellent.\r\nBarring that, if the test encyclopedia could enumerate what the remote test execution environment must provide in order for bazel's internal scripting to work, that would give us something to work off of in configuring our remote execution environment.\r\n\r\n### Bugs: what's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\nEasy to say: set up a remote test executor that does not make any system commands available to the test runner.  Then use it to remotely execute a test that leaves a file in `TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18.04.\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\nrelease 3.1.0\r\n\r\n###  Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n@werkt ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
