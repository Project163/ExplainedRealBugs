The second build gives the cyclic dependency error. Setting lockfile_mode=off makes it go back to giving the first error.

linear bisect on my machine, where I delete `MODULE.bazel.lock` before every build and run the build twice points to 476e183da5. It's always the second build that fails, which is the first to use the lockfile. https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ce993c49aeb16b9d64f76fd408ef0b5fa2e8bf63 only touches JVM rules, so it's rather unlikely to be the cause here (although not impossible, it touches the \"bootstrap\" part of Bzlmod).\r\n\r\nEdit: This makes sense as the cause: Validating the up-to-dateness of main repo mapping entries requests the full repo mapping, which causes a cycle if WORKSPACE evaluation, which is needed for the full repo mapping, also depends on a module extension with recorded repo mapping entries. The internal deps extension has such entries:\r\n```\r\n        \"recordedRepoMappingEntries\": [\r\n          [\r\n            \"\",\r\n            \"bazel_tools\",\r\n            \"bazel_tools\"\r\n          ]\r\n        ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to fix this. The chunked nature of WORKSPACE means that we only learn its repo mapping step by step and we certainly don't want to have a special repo mapping key for each chunk.
