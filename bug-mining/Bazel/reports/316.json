The error specifically occurs when Bazel tries to rename temporary parameter files.\nerror:\n\n`\nERROR: D:/myworkspace//BUILD.bazel:9:30: Compiling path/to/myfile.cxx failed: Exec failed due to IOException: D:\\udu\\b\\f65vp5rh\\execroot\\_main\\bazel-out\\x64_windows-opt\\bin\\path\\to\\mylib\\_objs\\libmylib_base\\myfile.obj.params.tmp.3723 -> D:\\udu\\b\\f65vp5rh\\execroot\\_main\\bazel-out\\x64_windows-opt\\bin\\path\\to\\mylib\\_objs\\libmylib_base\\myfile.obj.params (Permission denied)\n`\n\nWhen checking the build directory after the error, we only find the .obj.params file but not the .tmp.XXXX file mentioned in the error.\n\n`\nSUBCOMMAND: # //path/to/mylib:libmylib_base [action 'Compiling path/to/myfile.cxx'...]\ncd /d D:/udu/b/f65vp5rh/execroot/_main\n  SET BAZEL_DO_NOT_DETECT_CPP_TOOLCHAIN=1\n    SET INCLUDE=C:\\apps\\MVS174\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.29.30133\\ATLMFC\\include;...\n    SET PATH=C:\\apps\\MVS174\\Common7\\IDE\\\\Extensions\\Microsoft\\IntelliCode\\CLI;...\n  external\\toolchain+\\toolchain\\x64-windows\\14.29.30133\\cl.exe @bazel-out/x64_windows-opt/bin/path/to/mylib/_objs/libmylib_base/myfile.obj.params\n`\n\n\nThis issue appears consistently on windows builds and makes using remote caching unreliable. We've been examining the source code and suspect the issue occurs in `AbstractActionInputPrefetcher.java` at and around this line:\n\n\n[AbstractActionInputPrefetcher.java line 624](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/fce5effa85e01fb115b90a6e20881a5b81fa26c7/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/remote/AbstractActionInputPrefetcher.java#L624)\n\n\nThis line attempts to rename a temporary file to its final location, but on Windows this appears to fail with permission denied errors.\n\n\nMy configuration:\n\nwindows build environment.\nBazel caching with --remote_cache=grpc://server-name:port\nUsing --remote_download_toplevel/minimal\n\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
