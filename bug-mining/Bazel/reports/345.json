As a consequence, replacing an executable file with an executable target with additional runfiles is a potentially breaking change for anyone who consumes it in a filegroup.\n\n### Description\n\nWith `--incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data`, `filegroup` merges the runfiles from its `srcs` into its own runfiles, regardless of whether it is then used in a \"default\" or \"data\" runfiles context.\n\n### Incompatible Flag\n\n--incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data\n\n### Migration Guide\n\nSince flipping this flag may only add additional runfiles, migration usually isn't needed. \n\nAnalysis test assertions may need to be updated and test runtime may increase in some cases due to larger runfiles trees. If this causes problems, `query` and `cquery`'s `somepath` operator can be used to determine the source of the additional runfiles.\n\n### In which Bazel LTS version will this incompatible change be enabled?\n\nBazel 9\n\n### Additional Context\n\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25365\n\n### TODO List\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26330/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
