tried fixing this a few months ago but ran into circular dependency problems in Bazel's test setup code. Will take another look later.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1370925560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8151135114,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOATz7jc5aed8IzwAAAAHl2HOK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/8151135114","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-04T13:24:07Z","label":{"name":"platform:

Description of the bug:\n\n\nI have a repo with platforms defined:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/apple_support/blob/f2be7660d083eeb14e52134e60308411b6c9e74a/platforms/BUILD\r\n\r\nFor everyone consuming this repo I want to recommend a platform_mappings file like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @build_bazel_apple_support//platforms:ios_sim_arm64\r\n    --cpu=ios_sim_arm64\r\n    --apple_platform_type=ios\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `build_bazel_apple_support` is included in the platform label. But when building in the apple_support repo itself with this file, and passing something like `--platforms=@build_bazel_apple_support//platforms:ios_sim_arm64` as the platform, the platform_mappings file isn't taken into account. In the output of `bazel config SHA` you can see the platform is set correctly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  platforms: [//platforms:ios_sim_arm64]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the flags are not:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  apple_platform_type: macos\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I change the platform_mappings file to remove the repo name it works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  //platforms:ios_sim_arm64\r\n    --cpu=ios_sim_arm64\r\n    --apple_platform_type=ios\r\n```\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?

all, apologies for the confusion. We're trying to sustainably manage the number of open issues/PRs in the bazel repo and bring down the backlog.\r\n\r\nAll issues & PRs without any activity for 30 days will get a ping from the bot. If there's no further activity for an additional 7/14 days, they will be automatically closed.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want your issue/PR to be closed after the ping (or flagged), we request that you add a comment or notify a maintainer, and we'll add one of the following labels so that the issue is left open:\r\n- Issues: \"not stale\", \"awaiting-bazeler\"\r\n- PRs: \"not stale, \"awaiting-review\", \"awaiting-PR-merge\"\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions. We'll do our part to make sure appropriate labels are in place so that your issues/PRs don't get closed (or flagged)! cc @sgowroji
