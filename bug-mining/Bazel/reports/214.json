If a different value is set, platform-based flags should be able to explicitly set the default and have that override the previous value, but currently they are ignored.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/katre/bazel/commit/2aa5c32c9390160f9ea62a796de06a00786be565 for a small demo.\r\n\r\n# Original description\r\n\r\n### Description of the bug:\r\n\r\n\r\nI found a truly bizarre bug that I can't make heads or tails of. If a custom host platform explicitly sets a _particular label flag in Pigweed_ to a value, and a platform set via `platform_data` attempts to override it, then the override will fail.\r\n\r\nWhat's bizarre about it is that,\r\n\r\n1. It only happens when the target platform is set via `platform_data`, not if it's set on the command line.\r\n2. I've not been able to reproduce this with a minimal upstream repository, only with Pigweed itself.\r\n3. In fact I've not been able to reproduce it with other label flags in Pigweed, including label flags defined in the same `BUILD.bazel` file. As far as I can tell, there's only one unlucky flag that cannot be overridden!\r\n\r\n@katre I know you have a lot on your plate, but if you have any suggestions for how to debug this, they'd be very appreciated. This one is a real head-scratcher, and also prevented me from deploying platform-based flags.\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\nConfigurability\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
