Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a target with a c++ header file and a c++ source file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\n\r\ncc_library(\r\n    name = \"my_lib\",\r\n    hdrs = [\"my_lib.hpp\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\ncc_binary(\r\n    name = \"main\",\r\n    srcs = [\"main.cpp\"],\r\n    deps = [\"my_lib\"]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`my_lib.hpp` content:\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <string>\r\n\r\nstruct MyLib {\r\n  std::string value = \"my_lib\";\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n`main.cpp` content:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include \"my_lib.hpp\"\r\n\r\nint main(){\r\n  MyLib obj;\r\n  std::cout << obj.value << std::endl;\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `bazel run my_lib`. and modify `my_lib.hpp` to set default value of `MyLib::value` to another string (do not modify the `main.cpp`), run `bazel run my_lib` again.
