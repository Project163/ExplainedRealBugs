Since the introduction of the `watch` method and `watch` parameters on many other methods, there are far more flexible and consistent ways to watch paths. Furthermore, `watch = No` is currently not honored when passing a `Label` to any of these methods, which directly contradicts the intended behavior.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Description\n\nThe `repository_ctx.path` and `module_ctx.path` methods no longer cause the argument to be watched (previously, they did if and only if the argument is a `Label`).\r\n\r\nOther methods on the context objects no longer watch `Label` arguments with `watch = No`.\n\n### Incompatible Flag\n\n--incompatible_no_implicit_watch_label\n\n### Migration Guide\n\nIf any method with a `watch` parameter is used on the path returned by `path`, no action needs to be taken since it will be watched automatically in all versions of Bazel with the incompatible flag.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, explicitly call `watch` on the method if available, which can be tested with `hasattr` on the context object.\n\n### In which Bazel LTS version will this incompatible change be enabled?\n\nBazel 8\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### TODO List\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23861/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
