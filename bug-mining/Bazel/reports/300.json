The label passed to `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag` must be fully qualified. This means both using the canonical repo name, AND expanding any labels that match the name of their parent directory (e.g. `//foo:foo`).\n2. If a nonexistent flag is passed, Bazel doesn't emit any warnings or errors.\n\nThe compounding of the two issues makes `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag` difficult to use since the only way to ensure you've done the right thing is by creating some kind of test that verifies the behavior change of the flag.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nConfigurability\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
