into this some more. Even if `RunfilesSupport` adds the repo mapping artifact to root symlinks, the Python rules still wouldn't see it as it is added only after the rule implementation has run.

Getting it in the context of the rule only seems to be necessary if the rule wants to build a runfiles structure manually for itself - if it did this for some other rule, that rule's repo mapping would be in its runfiles.

I'm thinking just have an extra target generated along side with the necessary info, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef py_binary(name, ...\r\n  repo_mapping(\"_\" + name + \"_repo_map\")\r\n  py_binary_rule(..., _INTERNAL_ONLY_REPO_MAP = \"_\" + name + \"_repo_map\")\r\n\r\ndef repo_mapping_impl(ctx):\r\n  return [DefaultInfo()] # repo mapping automatically added, right?\r\n\r\ndef py_binary_impl(ctx):\r\n  repo_map = ctx.attr._INTERNAL_ONLY_REPO_MAP.runfiles\r\n```\r\n\r\nCouple other thoughts:\r\n* PyBuiltins.java is where various Java-hooks can go. If the necessary info can be easily gotten via Java, that's the place to put such hooks.\r\n* The `input_manifests` arg _might_ be of help? There's a (now unused) helper in PyBuiltins that converts a runfiles object into a RunfilesSupplier.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1498203128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rickeylev","id":34175098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTc1MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34175098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev","html_url":"https://github.com/rickeylev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickeylev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1509597047","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17941#issuecomment-1509597047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17941","id":1509597047,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5Z-p93","user":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-15T06:55:37Z","updated_at":"2023-04-15T06:55:37Z","body":"@rickeylev With Bzlmod enabled, every target has the repo mapping as a root symlinks that is injected in `getRunfilesInputs`: https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/Runfiles.java;drc=0ce17480390cdced2df8d59249561613e81f446f;l=421\nIt may thus not be accessible by rule implementations directly.\n\nThe artifact itself is created in `RunfilesSupport`: https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/RunfilesSupport.java;l=135;bpv=1;bpt=1\n\nWe may have to make it available from there.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1509597047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
