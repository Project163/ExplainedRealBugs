Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nMinimal example: https://github.com/jfirebaugh/bazel_experimental_reuse_sandbox_directories_bug\r\n\r\nClone this repository, and run `bazel build --repo_env=CREATE_DIRECTORY=1 --experimental_reuse_sandbox_directories genrule` followed by `bazel build --repo_env=CREATE_DIRECTORY=0 --experimental_reuse_sandbox_directories genrule` (the only difference between the two is the `CREATE_DIRECTORY` value). The second command will fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: <workspace>/BUILD.bazel:1:8: Executing genrule //:genrule failed: I/O exception during sandboxed execution: <output_base>/sandbox/darwin-sandbox/18/execroot/__main__/external/repository/output (Directory not empty)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the second command is modified to remove the use of `--experimental_reuse_sandbox_directories`, then it succeeds. It also succeeds if you delete the sandbox stash (`rm -rf \"$(bazel info output_base)/sandbox/sandbox_stash\"`).\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nmacOS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.4.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\nn/a\n```\n\n\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\n\n\nNo\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nNo\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19935/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
