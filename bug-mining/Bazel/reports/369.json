From a brief look through the code in Bazel that creates symlinks, symlinks shouldn’t be allowed to be created to directories on windows, requiring junctions instead.\n\nThis is causing rules_js to be unusable on Windows with newer versions of Bazel. See https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/issues/2261.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
