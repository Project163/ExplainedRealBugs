I thought to check BEP to see if there was an `exit_code` field on TestResult. The good news is that there is one, in `TestResult.ExecutionInfo`! The bad news is that I'm not seeing it in my BEP jsonl output file. My test, which is run standalone, is only providing a `timing_breakdown` value in its test result.\n\nDoes anyone know if this feature is working as intended? I did see in the code for StandaloneTestStrategy that `setExitCode` is called at some point, but it wasn't clear to me whether it was being called in a location relevant to BEP. Or maybe there's a better way to get at this information? \n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n1. Set a value for `--build_event_json_file`\n2. Write a test that fails in an unusual way\n3. Run the test with a test runner that returns some non-conventional exit code, such as 65.\n4. Observe the absent `exit_code` field in the BEP output for the failed `testResult`\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\nmacOS 15.3\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\nrelease 7.4.1\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nhttps://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/CA31HN1T3/p1738199682813539\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
