This worked fine when building for Linux, with auto-detected toolchain but cross-compiling for Windows, I got linker errors.\r\n\r\nLinking the executable fails because the command line contains `-lmylib.dll` whereas `-lmylib` is expected. After hours of digging I've found [this piece of code](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/dd305035b031081423ab51041ee525d38236a737/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/cpp/LibrariesToLinkCollector.java#L611):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    boolean hasCompatibleName =\r\n        name.startsWith(\"lib\") || (!name.endsWith(\".so\") && !name.endsWith(\".dylib\"));\r\n    if (CppFileTypes.SHARED_LIBRARY.matches(name) && hasCompatibleName) {\r\n      String libName = name.replaceAll(\"(^lib|\\\\.(so|dylib)$)\", \"\");\r\n      librariesToLink.addValue(LibraryToLinkValue.forDynamicLibrary(libName));\r\n    } else if (CppFileTypes.SHARED_LIBRARY.matches(name)\r\n        || CppFileTypes.VERSIONED_SHARED_LIBRARY.matches(name)) {\r\n      librariesToLink.addValue(LibraryToLinkValue.forVersionedDynamicLibrary(name));\r\n    } else {\r\n      // Interface shared objects have a non-standard extension\r\n      // that the linker won't be able to find.  So use the\r\n      // filename directly rather than a -l option.  Since the\r\n      // library has an SONAME attribute, this will work fine.\r\n      librariesToLink.addValue(\r\n          LibraryToLinkValue.forInterfaceLibrary(inputArtifact.getExecPathString()));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Linux, the \".so\" suffix is correctly stripped, on Windows it is not.\r\nAdding \"|dll\" to the `replaceAll` regular expression fixed the issue for me.\r\nI would assume to properly fix this, one would also add `&& !name.endsWith(\".dll\")` for `hasCompatibleName`.\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\n\r\nC++/Objective-C Rules, Configurability, Core\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
