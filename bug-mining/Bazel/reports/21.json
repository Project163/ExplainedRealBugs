However, it's common in CI to use `bazel query` to find the minimal set of targets to build/test to validate a proposed change. This typically produces a list of explicit targets which may include incompatible targets. Filtering them with `cquery` (https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets) works but is an extra step which takes time. Additionally, there might be thousands of targets to filter which must be chunked into separate command line invocations because `cquery` doesn't have any support for target pattern files like build and query do.\r\n\r\nA command line argument like `--skip_incompatible_explicit_targets` that skips incompatible explicit targets would allow us to take the output from `bazel query` and use it directly in a `bazel test` command without using `cquery` to filter out incompatible targets.\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nI'd like to speed up our CI builds by not filtering all of the affected targets through `cquery`.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 4.2.2-2.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\nWe've internally forked bazel but this feature request is unrelated to our modifications.\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\nIt outputs a few commits from our internal fork.\n```\n\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nI started a discussion in the Bazel Slack workspace here: https://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/CA31HN1T3/p1670884944989049\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
