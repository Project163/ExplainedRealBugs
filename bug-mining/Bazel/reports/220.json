A chain which by all accounts appears to still exist behind the scenes in Bazel, its just that only the error message is shown now (meaning the cause is never shown).\r\n\r\nIs there a way more information can be exposed to permit debugging of this issue?\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore, Local Execution\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nAs implied by this issue being undiagnosed, I've so far been unable to reproduce the issue intentionally. I have determined that CI passes if `bazel clean` is run first, which suggests a collision in the output directory.\r\n\r\nHowever for investigating the lack of a stack trace, the repro for similar issues that have occurred recently should suffice. e.g. #22260 \n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux, macOS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 7.2.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nOutput snippet for reference (shows 2 targets `:lib` and `:pkg` in the same package having actions fail due to outputs being unable to be copied).\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO: Analyzed target //tools/protogen_regenerate:cli (414 packages loaded, 7482 targets configured).\r\nERROR: /___/tools/logging/BUILD.bazel:15:15: Transpiling & type-checking TypeScript project @@//tools/logging:lib [tsc -p tools/logging/tsconfig.json] failed: I/O exception during sandboxed execution: Could not move output artifacts from sandboxed execution\r\nTarget //tools/protogen_regenerate:cli failed to build\r\nERROR: /___/tools/logging/BUILD.bazel:8:12 Copying files to directory tools/logging/pkg failed: I/O exception during sandboxed execution: Could not move output artifacts from sandboxed execution\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
