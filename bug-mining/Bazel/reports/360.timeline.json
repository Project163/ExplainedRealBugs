So the best think I can think of is that if `WatchService` detects that a directory is deleted (or maybe created), iterate over all nodes in Skyframe and  mark the ones under it as dirty.\n\nThe silver lining of this cloud is that this shouldn't be too slow, since it's a CPU-only operation, no I/O is
