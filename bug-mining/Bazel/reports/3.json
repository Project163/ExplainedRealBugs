issue tracks enabling `--incompatible_python_disable_py2` (implemented in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d1bbf4b7698e019c11b7d1c483eb0b4959954060) as part of #15684 \r\n\r\nWhen enabled, the Python rules will reject Python 2 only attribute values. This includes:\r\n  * `python_version=PY2`\r\n  * `srcs_version=PY2` and `srcs_version=PY2ONLY`\r\n  * Setting `py2_runtime`\r\n\r\nTo fix, you must update your rules (or dependencies) to not set these Python 2 values:\r\n  * For `srcs_version`: remove the attribute.\r\n  * For `py2_runtime`: remove the attribute.\r\n  * For `python_version`: remove the attribute from `py_binary` and `py_test`. For `py_runtime`, \r\n    the entire target can be deleted, as there is nothing that can use it.\r\n\r\nNote that the `PyInfo` and `PyRuntimeInfo` providers do not raise an error. This is simply because providers can't access flags to know whether to enforce behavior; code should still be updated as appropriate:\r\n  * For PyInfo, stop reading/writing `has_py2_only_sources` and `has_py3_only_sources`.\r\n  * For PyRuntimeInfo, set `python_version=PY3`\r\n\r\nMost of this can be automated using [buildozer](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildozer)\r\n\r\n```\r\nremove python_version //...%py_binary\r\nremove python_version //...%py_test\r\nremove srcs_version //...%py_binary\r\nremove srcs_version //...%py_test\r\nremove srcs_version //...%py_library\r\nremove py2_runtime //...%py_runtime_pair\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may not be your code with a problem, but a dependency. In this case, you probably just need to update your dependency to a newer version -- most projects no longer require Python 2.\r\n  * For rules_pkg, upgrade to 0.3.0 or greater\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
