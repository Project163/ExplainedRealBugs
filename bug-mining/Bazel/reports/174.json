If using `--noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution`, or using `bazel test`, test results appear as soon as the tests are done running.\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\nCore\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n```shellsession\r\n$ git checkout git@github.com:bazelbuild/bazel.git\r\n$ cd bazel\r\n$ USE_BAZEL_VERSION=7.0.2 bazel coverage --bes_results_url=https://app.buildbuddy.io/invocation/ --bes_backend=grpcs://remote.buildbuddy.io --cache_test_results=no //src/test/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/...\r\n$ USE_BAZEL_VERSION=7.0.2 bazel clean\r\n$ USE_BAZEL_VERSION=7.0.2 bazel coverage --bes_results_url=https://app.buildbuddy.io/invocation/ --bes_backend=grpcs://remote.buildbuddy.io --cache_test_results=no --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution //src/test/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the first run, `testResult` events aren't published until the end of the build. In the second run they are published as soon as they are done running.\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 7.0.2\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nI saw the message in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/37247d53dc828ad9d03cf4a1537d1db5d83caf99, and it seems that there was a change regarding how the combined report was generated. Maybe that is delaying these related events?\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
