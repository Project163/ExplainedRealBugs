Notably, there is no happens-before relationship between the actual filesystem operation creating the symlink and the execution of dependent actions, which results in a race that can result in the symlink not being available during action execution, thus causing an `IOException`.\r\n\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n1. Increase the likelihood of action execution winning the race by inserting `Thread.sleep(10000)` before line https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/d8613c222f233406165c623b1a92179faed142ba:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/buildtool/SymlinkForest.java;l=474.\r\n2. Run `bazel build //...` in https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/main/frontend.\r\n\r\nThis should reliably reproduce https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/issues/421.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nAny\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nHEAD\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?
