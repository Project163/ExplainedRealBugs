This is problematic because if we create a PR to upgrade Bazel version to 8.x, it will corrupt all CI machines used to build that PR, i.e., all other PRs that are still using 7.x will fail if they use the same CI machines.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
