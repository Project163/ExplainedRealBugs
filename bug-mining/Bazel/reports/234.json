However, if you run bazel test a second time (all tests should be cached, so this is actually a no-op), all the test logs get uploaded then. This assigns a new invocation, however, since the shas of the cached tests are the same, the old invocation's test logs get populated too.\r\n\r\nBy \"not all logs are uploaded\", I mean that some logs are uploaded successfully, but others are not even attempted to be uploaded (therefore the bazel timeout and retry options have no effect). I haven't been able to find a correlation between which logs are uploaded and which are not. \r\n\r\nIf I remove the `--disk_cache=` arg, all the logs are uploaded on the first try.\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\n\r\nRemote caching\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n`bazel test --disk_cache=~/.cache/bazel --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:9089 --bes_backend=<something> --noremote_upload_local_results --experimental_build_event_upload_max_retries=10 --remote_retries=10 --remote_timeout=1h //...`\r\n\r\nI haven't tested without the bes backend, because I use the bes viewer to check whether the logs are there. For bes I used the OSS buildbuddy docker container.\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\nBazelisk version: v1.15.0\r\nBuild label: 7.0.1\r\nBuild target: @@//src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel:BazelServer\r\nBuild time: Thu Jan 18 18:04:46 2024 (1705601086)\r\nBuild timestamp: 1705601086\r\nBuild timestamp as int: 1705601086\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go.git\r\n54c12e5d6bc591137ca9127a7629a8fc68ab6094\r\n54c12e5d6bc591137ca9127a7629a8fc68ab6094\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?
