agree that, if the credential helper returns a nonzero exit code, the helper response should be completely ignored (i.e., a subsequent request to the same URI should always call the helper again).\n\nHowever, I'm not sure I understand this sentence:\n\n> Furthermore, this caching of connection completely ignores the expiry provided to Bazel in the credential helper response.\n\nAre you still talking about the case where the helper returns a nonzero exit code? Or are you saying that, *even if the helper returns exit code 0 and includes an expiry in the response*, the HTTP downloader will keep using the credentials for longer than the expiry?
