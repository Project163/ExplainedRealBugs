could be as simple as (expanding on what I wrote in the doc back then):\r\n1. adding a new `facts` parameter to `module_ctx.extension_metadata` that accepts an arbitrary Starlark value that can be converted to JSON. This is persisted in the lockfile, even for reproducible extensions (in that case, only the facts). Facts can help make more extensions reproducible. In lockfile mode `error`, a reproducible extension is expected to produce the exact same fact object that it received, otherwise it is considered out of date and fails.\r\n2. if a lockfile entry for the extension (and OS/arch, if dependent on those) exists and its `bzlTransitiveDigest` matches (but not necessarily its usages or recorded inputs hashes), provide that object back to the implementation in `module_ctx.facts`.\r\n\r\nExtensions are expected to only store universally true statements in facts, e.g. the immutable foo registry package bar@1.2.3 has download URL X and hash Y. It's essentially a generic `go.sum` file.\r\n\r\n@Wyverald @meteorcloudy \n\nEdit: Edited to better explain how reproducible extensions work with

Description of the feature request:\n\n\nMost rulesets that integrate with third-party deps maintain their own lock files. These are read at build-time to generate various workspaces (eg. `@maven` is commonly created when using `rules_jvm_external`). At present, the way to fully update a module file to incorporate changes made in these definitions is:\n\n1. Update the source of truth for the third party deps\n1. Run ruleset-specific tooling to update the lock file\n1. Run `bazel mod tidy`\n\nIt would be a smoother user experience if there was some way to tell Bazel that the second step could be performed using some target that can be `bazel run`.  Could we extend `module_context.extension_metadata` to include a list of runnable targets, env vars, and possibly command line flags that could be called to update deps?\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nSimplifying developer workflows when updating third party dependencies. This is handled differently by every ruleset, and makes working in a polyglot repo hard, especially for users who seldom update dependencies.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nThere is a proposal for the module lock file to have persistent storage: #24777. It is possible that as part of this, we could use the bazel lock file to store resolution results (or similar) for third party dependencies, but to do so, we'd still need to use `bazel run`.\n\nAs an example, in `rules_jvm_external` the resolution is done using a target that can be executed via `bazel run`, as the target has its own dependencies, is too large to include as a binary, and requires the use of the hermetic java toolchain provided by `rules_java`. We don't want to prebuild the resolver since that would require additional infrastructure for us to manage release and would complicate developing the ruleset.\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n[Discussion on the Bazel Slack channel](https://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/C014RARENH0/p1737035398851649)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24951/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16000168314,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOATz7jc6kDDvazwAAAAO5rzF6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/16000168314","actor":{"login":"meteorcloudy","id":4171702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE3MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy","html_url":"https://github.com/meteorcloudy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-20T14:56:07Z","label":{"name":"untriaged","color":"c34ddd"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16000168317,"node_id":"LE_lADOATz7jc6kDDvazwAAAAO5rzF9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/16000168317","actor":{"login":"meteorcloudy","id":4171702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE3MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy","html_url":"https://github.com/meteorcloudy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-20T14:56:07Z","label":{"name":"P2","color":"e99695"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2674494229","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24777#issuecomment-2674494229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24777","id":2674494229,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc6faYsV","user":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-21T13:00:16Z","updated_at":"2025-02-21T13:01:40Z","body":"There's another potential application for this: `use_repo_rule` could use it to persist the \"recommended attributes\" that a repo rule implementation can return (e.g. for `sha256`). This would allow repo rules to persist and reuse hashes and other information that is costly to compute without a need for users to specify them manually in `MODULE.bazel`.\n\n@malt3, @sluongng and I are thinking about how to make repo rules work better with BwoB. A \"remote-friendly\" variant of `http_archive` could rely on this capability to persist the names of files in an archive, which could then be fetched and extracted in a build rule while still allowing analysis time access to the archive contents. \n\n@Wyverald @meteorcloudy What do you think about that? This could resolve most of the \"repo rules should be able to depend on build rules\" use cases with much lower implementation complexity. https://github.com/fmeum/rbe_repos.bzl/tree/main/examples is a prototype I built to demonstrate what this could do, but it currently requires a module extension wrapper to persist information in the
