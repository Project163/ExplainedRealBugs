expand a bit on the issue: due to how Bazel works internally (the action inputs are mutated in place after input discovery), all headers are missing if `aquery` is run before action execution, and headers that survive pruning are present if `aquery` is run after action execution. (For Bazel, all headers survive pruning since include scanning is a Blaze-only feature; I'm only including this sentence for additional context.)\r\n\r\nIn a related note, I've recently discovered that `aquery` will also omit pruned inputs (i.e., inputs reported in a `unused_inputs_list` for a Starlark action or the equivalent mechanism for native C++ and Java actions) when run after execution, including when the action is loaded from the persistent action cache. In this case there's no way to force `aquery` to report them, as they're (afaict) completely gone from Bazel's internal representation of the action.\r\n\r\nKeeping this untriaged so we discuss it at the next subteam meeting and decide what to do about it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2261324332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2261470940","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23154#issuecomment-2261470940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23154","id":2261470940,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc6Gy07c","user":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-31T21:12:13Z","updated_at":"2024-07-31T21:12:13Z","body":"@tjgq
