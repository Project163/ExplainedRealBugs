Description of the problem:\r\n\r\nThe constraint value `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler:gcc` is not detected/enabled correctly when the GCC compiler is used and can not be targeted with a `config_setting`.\r\n\r\n### Bugs: what's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\nThe following Bazel repo demonstrates the issue. It has a dummy target that is intended to be compiled with different `copts`, depending on the compiler. We use `config_setting`s  which match on the `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler` flag and `select` on them later.\r\n\r\nWORKSPACE:\r\n```starlark\r\nworkspace(name = \"test-bar\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBUILD:\r\n```bazel\r\nconfig_setting(\r\n    name = \"llvm_compiler\",\r\n    flag_values = {\"@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler\": \"clang\"},\r\n)\r\n\r\nconfig_setting(\r\n    name = \"gcc_compiler\",\r\n    flag_values = {\"@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler\": \"gcc\"},\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Only to show the bug(?) in the local `cc_toolchain_config`.\r\nconfig_setting(\r\n    name = \"compiler_compiler\",\r\n    flag_values = {\"@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler\": \"compiler\"},\r\n)\r\n\r\n# non-existent flags to show which condition matched.\r\nDEFAULT_COPTS = select({\r\n    \":llvm_compiler\": [\"-fail_llvm\"],\r\n    \":gcc_compiler\": [\"-fail_gcc\"],\r\n    \":compiler_compiler\": [\"-fail_compiler\"],\r\n    \"//conditions:default\": [\"-fail_default\"],\r\n})\r\n\r\ncc_binary(\r\n    name = \"dummy\",\r\n    srcs = [\"empty.cc\"],\r\n    copts = DEFAULT_COPTS,\r\n    deps = [],\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nempty.cc\r\n```c++\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe system has both gcc and clang installed and available in $PATH:\r\n```\r\n> gcc -v\r\ngcc version 9.3.0 (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04)\r\n\r\n> clang -v\r\nUbuntu clang version 12.0.0-++20201207052627+22558c8501e-1~exp1~20201207163316.246\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow try to compile the dummy target.\r\n\r\nWith no `$CC`/`$CXX` set, we expect the build to fail with the `-fail_gcc` message, as GCC is the default.
