Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n1. download [hello-bazel-java.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22077127/hello-bazel-java.zip)\n2. run demo.sh\n```\n$ cat demo.sh\nset -euxo pipefail\n\nbazelisk shutdown\n\nbazelisk build //... --watchfs\nmv src/main/java/com/example/{app,app2}\nbazelisk build //... --watchfs || true\nmv src/main/java/com/example/{app2,app}\nbazelisk build //... --watchfs\nmv src/main/java/com/example/{app,app2}\nbazelisk build //... --watchfs || true\nmv src/main/java/com/example/{app2,app}\nbazelisk build //... --watchfs && echo OK || {\n    echo FAIL, try again after shutdown\n    bazelisk shutdown\n    bazelisk build //... --watchfs\n    exit 1\n}\n```\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nUbuntu 22.04.5 LTS\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.3.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n```\n+ bazelisk shutdown\n+ bazelisk build //... --watchfs\nStarting local Bazel server (8.3.1) and connecting to it...\nINFO: Analyzed 3 targets (82 packages
