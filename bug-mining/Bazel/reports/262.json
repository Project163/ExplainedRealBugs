I'm seeing errors where the worker doesn't get run because the executable isn't present in the sandbox. `IOException while preparing the execution environment of a worker`\r\n\r\nBoth path mapping and multiplex sandboxing work on their own:\r\n\r\n- Disabling multiplex workers with `--noworker_multiplex` gets path mapping working.\r\n- Disabling path mapping with `--experimental_output_paths=off` gets multiplex sandboxing working.\r\n\r\nHere's a minimal repro case as well as the full error (in the README): https://github.com/lucidsoftware/path-mapping-bug-repro You can repro with `bazel build example`. The worker doesn't do anything, but it doesn't need to in order to repro the bug as we're not getting to the point where the worker actually runs.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @jjudd in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658#discussioncomment-10918092_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
