a multi-tenancy server deployment setup, the clients might want to\r\ntreat the remote downloader server as a pull-through proxy and use it to\r\ndownload from private storage systems.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we do support it via --remote_downloader_headers. However\r\nthis scheme does not apply to the specific URL, while credentials and\r\nauthentication could sometimes be host/domain specific.\r\n\r\nAdd a flag to let users opt-in to credentials propagation to the remote\r\nserver. This is off by default as not all remote servers can be\r\ntrusted. When the flag is enabled, URL-specific credentials from Netrc\r\nor a custom credentials helper can be propagated to the remote server.\r\n\r\nThe server implementation needs to support the new\r\n`http_header_url:<url-index>:<header-key>` qualifier where the\r\n`url-index` is a 0-based position of the URL inside the\r\nFetchBlobRequest's uris field. This new qualifier is modeled after the\r\nexisting `http_header` qualifier.\r\n\r\nFixes #23499\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23578/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14253305241,"node_id":"CE_lADOATz7jc6VK_PazwAAAANRkC2Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/14253305241","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"4c12bfedbccb1f65d3b751d1a1c1ae85cb9275b0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/4c12bfedbccb1f65d3b751d1a1c1ae85cb9275b0","created_at":"2024-09-13T19:16:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14253819693,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6VK_PazwAAAANRmAct","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/14253819693","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4c12bfedbccb1f65d3b751d1a1c1ae85cb9275b0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sysfce2/bazel/commits/4c12bfedbccb1f65d3b751d1a1c1ae85cb9275b0","created_at":"2024-09-13T20:03:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
