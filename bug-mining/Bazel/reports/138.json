Description of the bug:\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE.bazel.lock repeats content from package manager lockfiles, leading to serious developer experience regressions.\r\n\r\n## Desired behavior\r\n\r\nAs an example, in https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/611827d1bacfe83408cba2bbdcca4a801687d814/frontend\r\n\r\nBazel (via `npm_translate_lock`) starts from `pnpm-lock.yaml` [1] which fully specifies all the fields (URL, integrity) needed for `rctx.download` calls in rules_js.\r\nWhen developers have a merge conflict in that file, they can just run the install again, because the tool is aware of git merge conflict markers. https://pnpm.io/git#merge-conflicts (the same is true for npm and yarn, the other popular JS package managers)\r\n\r\n> Note that in a big monorepo, it's very common to have lockfile merge conflicts because a PR that updates versions take a while to land (you have to green up all the usages) and in the meantime you need to rebase over other commits that have landed which also updated a dependency.\r\n\r\nAlso, when tooling like Dependabot updates their dependency versions, the lockfile is updated as well.\r\n\r\nSo, when the lockfile is updated, I would expect this entry in the `MODULE.bazel.lock` file to be trivially updated:\r\n```\r\n \"accumulatedFileDigests\": {\r\n    \"@@//:.npmrc\": \"25afec638a4a1dc4a7277d8babd30464e9d942cf93d3e47505a4677adad1a901\",\r\n    \"@@//:pnpm-lock.yaml\": \"656fb164bf8539b6945f307477907a7087d4b7b74db0e525065d1ba70898ebd5\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nHowever, when upgrading that repo to Bazel 7.0, we now get a MASSIVE Bazel lockfile, much larger than the original:\r\n```\r\n$ bazel query //...\r\n$ wc -l MODULE.bazel.lock pnpm-lock.yaml \r\n 172470 MODULE.bazel.lock\r\n  12893 pnpm-lock.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf these lines, nearly all are in this block:\r\n```\r\n\"moduleExtensions\": {\r\n    \"@@aspect_rules_js~1.32.2//npm:extensions.bzl%npm\": {\r\n      \"general\": {\r\n        \"bzlTransitiveDigest\": \"EkNX7WbLkG1/zKMTRsHgYFdQKwWxWuZMReEve7JbvqQ=\",\r\n        \"accumulatedFileDigests\": {\r\n          \"@@//:.npmrc\": \"25afec638a4a1dc4a7277d8babd30464e9d942cf93d3e47505a4677adad1a901\",\r\n          \"@@//:pnpm-lock.yaml\": \"656fb164bf8539b6945f307477907a7087d4b7b74db0e525065d1ba70898ebd5\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"envVariables\": {},\r\n        \"generatedRepoSpecs\": {\r\n... [170,990 lines elided] ...\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny merge conflicts in this file will present the developer with a massive headache, and they'll likely just delete-and-recreate the lockfile to get past it. Of course that's a bad practice as you've accidentally lost the pinning of all other Bazel modules.\r\n\r\nAlso, PRs from Dependabot will cause Bazel's lockfile to be out-of-date. Dependabot PRs are commonly security-related, so engineers have a great sense of urgency in merging them, and will again just work around the Bazel lockfile checking on CI or disable the feature.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/blob/main/frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Dependency\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\n7.0.0rc4\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20272/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20272/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
