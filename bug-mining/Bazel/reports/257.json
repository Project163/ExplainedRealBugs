Description of the bug:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a dependency on a **Bazel module** [swift-syntax](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/swift-syntax), for reasons we override this module using `archive_override`:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nSWIFT_SYNTAX_VERSION = \"510.0.3\"\r\n\r\nbazel_dep(\r\n    name = \"swift-syntax\",\r\n    version = SWIFT_SYNTAX_VERSION,\r\n    repo_name = \"SwiftSyntax\",\r\n)\r\n\r\narchive_override(\r\n    module_name = \"swift-syntax\",\r\n    integrity = \"sha256-8HShak9S6SPqhVyHqV89Jnz37KdNa907iyPnSuWfpys=\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"swift-syntax-%s\" % SWIFT_SYNTAX_VERSION,\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://github.com/square/swift-syntax-prebuilt/releases/download/{version}/swift-syntax-{version}.tar.gz\".format(\r\n            version = SWIFT_SYNTAX_VERSION,\r\n        ),\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use another **Bazel module** [rules_swift_package_manager](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/rules_swift_package_manager) which provides a module extension `swift_deps` that provides **Bazel repositories** for use within the build. This `swift_deps` extension proxy generates a repository named `swiftpkg_swift_syntax`.\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nswift_deps = use_extension(\r\n    \"@rules_swift_package_manager//:extensions.bzl\",\r\n    \"swift_deps\",\r\n)\r\nswift_deps.from_package(\r\n    declare_swift_deps_info = True,\r\n    resolved = \"Package.resolved\",\r\n    swift = \"Package.swift\",\r\n)\r\nuse_repo(\r\n    swift_deps,\r\n    \"swift_deps_info\",\r\n    \"swiftpkg_swift_syntax\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to replace the `swiftpkg_swift_syntax` repository with my override `swift-syntax` repository, I use the new `override_repo` feature in Bazel 7.4+:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\noverride_repo(\r\n    swift_deps,\r\n    swiftpkg_swift_syntax = \"swift-syntax\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the following error:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbazel build //...\r\n\r\nStarting local Bazel server and connecting to it...\r\nERROR: /Users/lpadron/Desktop/override_repo_example/MODULE.bazel:87:14: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n        File \"/Users/lpadron/Desktop/override_repo_example/MODULE.bazel\", line 87, column 14, in <toplevel>\r\n                override_repo(\r\nError in override_repo: The repo exported as 'swiftpkg_swift_syntax' by module extension 'swift_deps' is overridden with 'swift-syntax', but no repo is visible under this name\r\nERROR: Error computing the main repository mapping: error executing MODULE.bazel file for the root module\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
