However, they cannot be expanded, and thus canonicalization of a set of flags using only the flag proto may include flags that are superseded by later expansion flags, which is not ideal.\n\nFor context, my current goal is to use `help flags-as-proto` output to parse the arguments passed to a bazel command, detect trivial problems, and canonicalize the arguments passed in.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\ndebian trixie\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.0.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\nfatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)\nStopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).\nfatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)\nStopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).\n```\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nI found that there are boolean-like flags that also accept enum values via `BoolOrEnumConverter`.\n\nI found that there are currently 21 expansion options in bazel:\n```\nnoincompatible_genquery_use_graphless_query\nincompatible_genquery_use_graphless_query\npersistent_android_resource_processor\npersistent_multiplex_android_resource_processor\npersistent_android_dex_desugar\npersistent_multiplex_android_dex_desugar\npersistent_multiplex_android_tools\nstart_app\ndebug_app\njava_debug\nremote_download_minimal\nremote_download_toplevel\nhost_jvm_debug\nlong\nshort\nexpunge_async\nexperimental_spawn_scheduler\nexperimental_persistent_javac\nnull\norder_results\nnoorder_results\n```\n\nIf the expansions are added to the proto, I can support these 21 manually in order to be compatible with older versions of bazel, and then support any expansion options added in the future dynamically using the proto.\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25006/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25006/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
