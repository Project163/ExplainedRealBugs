@Wyverald \r\n\r\nGetting rid of the `@` would probably require wiring up the actual `StarlarkSemantics` in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/7556e1107b666d10b660470a571631463c7eb4ec/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/query2/cquery/StarlarkOutputFormatterCallback.java#L191 instead of using the defaults.\r\n\r\nHaving consistent stringification across cquery output modes is challenging with Bzlmod: In the interest of emitting human-readable labels, I implemented main repository mapping \"unmapping\" to the default output mode. This means that canonical repository names such as `@rules_go~1.2.3~go_deps~foo` will be printed as `@foo` if the main repository declares the apparent name `foo` for this repo.\r\n\r\nBut in general Starlark code, the stringification of a label should always yield a canonical label string such as `@@rules_go~1.2.3~go_deps~foo//...`. Changing that behavior just for cquery would seem to require passing in a custom `StarlarkSemantics` object for cquery that includes the main repository mapping.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1481435053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8829165001,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc5hnhzCzwAAAAIOQl3J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/8829165001","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-23T15:48:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8829165018,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc5hnhzCzwAAAAIOQl3a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/8829165018","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-23T15:48:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8831267306,"node_id":"LE_lADOATz7jc5hnhzCzwAAAAIOYnHq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/8831267306","actor":{"login":"ShreeM01","id":109167932,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoHFPA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109167932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01","html_url":"https://github.com/ShreeM01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreeM01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-23T18:56:47Z","label":{"name":"type:

Description\r\n\r\nIt appears that bazel `cquery` output when using the starlark output format [has changed in bazel 6](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17864).
