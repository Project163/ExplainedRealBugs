Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nI originally confirmed the issue by overriding remote_coverage_tools and patching LcovPrinter.print to return false unconditionally, which sure enough, produces a 0 byte lcov database but doesn't fail the action.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nAny\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 7.1.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel.git\r\nd7a9bb5b1e345097820a89fcda106dc7eb7d3fa0\n```\n\n\n### Is this a regression? If yes, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced.\n\n\nThis was always a problem.\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nI suggest we modify LcovPrinter.print with throws IOException.
