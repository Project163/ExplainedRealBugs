Description of the feature request:\n\n\nForking from #25167 and its implementation in #25205, it was requested during code review that the default output root on macOS be moved from the historically relevant `/private/var/tmp` to the more conventional `$HOME/Library/Caches`. This issue serves to track that implementation.\n\nAs a relatively new contributor, it's unclear if this is would be an incompatible change, though based on the fact I can't see any incompatible startup options, I am assuming it's either atypical or not supported in the release model.
