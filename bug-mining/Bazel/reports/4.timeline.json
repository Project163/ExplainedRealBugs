not easily as the code base we build this on is private and I cannot share it. Also it's built using a localjdk workspace config so none of that would be repeatable on anyone else's machine (unless they have java in the same path).\r\n\r\nThe issue is quite straightforward / obvious though. The `Optional.isEmpty` method was added in Java 9+ so it would (as expected) fail in any Java 8 JVMs. My ask is can we just make this 1 line Java 8 compliant by making it `!optional.isPresent()` instead.\r\n\r\nIf Bazel still intends to support Java 8+ then this would be a requirement to make sure that the coverage tools remain Java 8 compliant. Unless the intention is Java 8+ compilation and not runtime.\r\n\r\nThis all works just fine on Bazel 5.4.0 and if you look at the diffs between 5.4.0 and 6.0.0, you can see this class updated to Java 9+ only complaint code.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1375859506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cjohnstoniv","id":1009163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkxNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv","html_url":"https://github.com/cjohnstoniv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjohnstoniv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1375883123","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17165#issuecomment-1375883123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17165","id":1375883123,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5SAk9z","user":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-09T16:12:16Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T16:12:16Z","body":"I personally don't see a reason not to make this one line compatible with Java 8.
