While this ensures that any literal Unicode character in the pattern will match that character in a path, it makes it so that any kind of Unicode-aware pattern logic (case insensitive match, character ranges etc.) won't behave correctly.\n\nInstead, both patterns and file paths should be transformed with `StringEncoding.internalToUnicode` before matching.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nCore\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
