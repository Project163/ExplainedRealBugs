I could argue it makes it more confusing, as there will be a magical value for this flag (zero) that will have one behaviour (clear the cache), while all others values wont.\r\n\r\n> compromise by declaring that --credential_helper_cache_duration=0 also has the effect of clearing the cache\r\n\r\nIs there a difference in terms of complexity, between the proposed solution, and clearing the cache every time the flag changes value?
