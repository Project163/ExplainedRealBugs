@Wyverald WDYT?\r\n\r\nI could imagine implementing something like `ctx.download_multiple()`; it would be a non-trivial but small addition to our API surface, although the official Bazel Way at the moment is, as you say, to define multiple repositories and achieve parallelism that way.\r\n\r\n@jacky8hyf How big are your downloads and how many of them are there and what pain do you experience from this? As long as you don't have an enormous number, repository-level parallelization should work, even if it is, as you say, a bit clunky.\r\n\r\nWhat I have pretty strong feelings about is that I'd much rather not get into the business of implementing something like Futures (`tokens = [ctx.download(url) for url in urls]; [token.wait() for token in tokens]`) in Starlark.\r\n\r\nFrom that internal bug, do I understand correctly that this is not a hard blocker, \"only\" a significant usability hurdle?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1753046186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lberki","id":3524818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjQ4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3524818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki","html_url":"https://github.com/lberki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lberki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10591542857,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc5yV-v8zwAAAAJ3Th5J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10591542857","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-09T13:45:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10591542881,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc5yV-v8zwAAAAJ3Th5h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10591542881","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-09T13:45:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10591542903,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc5yV-v8zwAAAAJ3Th53","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10591542903","actor":{"login":"meteorcloudy","id":4171702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE3MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy","html_url":"https://github.com/meteorcloudy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-09T13:45:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10591542913,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc5yV-v8zwAAAAJ3Th6B","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/

think I'm hitting into a use case for this as well, though in my case splitting the downloads across multiple repos doesn't help, as passing a list of labels to a subsequent repo rule seems to still force downloads to happen serially. Details copied from the [Slack thread][slack].\r\n\r\nTo add some detail, I'm attempting to write a module extension that downloads several artifacts, extracts them, and then manipulates the output (in a way that's not amenable to e.g. a `genrule`).\r\n\r\nInitially I went for the obvious implementation (`rctx.download_and_extract()` in a loop). Which worked, but had the disadvantage that prompted this FR, i.e. the downloads being serial.\r\n\r\nI tried to work around this by changing it to more of a hub-and-spoke model: the `module_extension` generates a number of `http_archive`s, and then another repo rule takes a label list with the targets from the `http_archive`s.\r\n\r\nHowever, this also seems to result in downloads happening serially -- I'm guessing this is because the label attr prefetch mechanism mentioned in the [docs][prefetch].\r\n\r\nI've got a minimal-ish repro [here][repro] if it helps clarify the use-case at all. Please let me know if there's anything I've missed that would make the workaround as described ineffective.\r\n\r\n[slack]:
