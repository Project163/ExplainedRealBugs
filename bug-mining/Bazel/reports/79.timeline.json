Add a dummy SDK in `android_sdk_repository` (https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android/pull/154)\r\n   1. The dummy SDK is ugly, I'd prefer to remove it entirely, and it's definitely a hack.\r\n2. Make [`DexArchiveAspect`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/android/DexArchiveAspect.java) not care if the SDK can't be fulfilled: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19649\r\n   1. I'm not sure how to tell if this is causing an error in the case where `DexArchiveAspect` can't find the SDK.\r\n   2. I _think_ that based on the comment at [`getPlatformBasedToolchainJars`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/android/DexArchiveAspect.java;drc=8b75e0b2b9c14f44ed02e24f20c0589398cab78d;l=214) that this is okay, but I'd really like to prove it.\r\n3. Make `AndroidPlatformsTransition` set the relevant flags (`--cpu`, `--android_cpu`, etc) (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19650) and add a platform_mapping file to every project so that `android_binary` sees a valid target platform.\r\n   1. This is probably the most correct, but requires anyone doing a legacy build to include a valid platform_mappings file.\r\n   2. On the one hand we can provide a trivial file to use\r\n   3. On the other hand it has to be copied into projects, there's no way to use a platform mapping from an external repository.\r\n\r\n@ted-xie, your empty SDK change (#19601) does not appear to be a valid solution: all of these work with and without it.\r\n\r\n@ted-xie Let me know which of these you think is best.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1737949926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"katre","id":326527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre","html_url":"https://github.com/katre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10491340615,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc5xz22QzwAAAAJxVSdH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10491340615","actor":{"login":"ted-xie","id":4371677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzE2Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4371677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie","html_url":"https://github.com/ted-xie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-27T19:20:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10491340628,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc5xz22QzwAAAAJxVSdU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/10491340628","actor":{"login":"ted-xie","id":4371677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzE2Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4371677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie","html_url":"https://github.com/ted-xie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ted-xie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-27T19:20:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"katre","id":326527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre","html_url":"https://github.com/katre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-03T15:17:06Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T15:17:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_android/issues/154","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_android","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_android/issues/154/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_android/issues/154/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_android/is
