Description of the feature request:\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to use this in my WORKSPACE file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"my_repo\",\r\n    url = \"https://gitlab.com/kilian-funk/test_project/-/archive/main/test_project-main.tar.gz\",\r\n    auth_patterns = {\"gitlab.com\": \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: <password>\"},\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere `test_project` is a private repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tarball containing the repo can be downloaded on the command line with:\r\n```\r\ncurl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: <token-goes-here>\" <url>\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately the `http_archive` rule results in something equivalent to:\r\n```\r\ncurl --header \"Authentication: PRIVATE-TOKEN: <token-goes-here>\" <url>\r\n```\r\nTherefore, `http_archive` is not compatible with gitlab.com for private repos, since it does not let the user customize the authentication header in the required way. `http_archive` is making too many assumptions on how an authentication header should look like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nLinux, Ubuntu\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 5.3.2\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to

Description of the feature request:\n\n\nCurrently, the value of `--credential_helper` can be either the path to a script that resides in the workspace or an executable on `PATH`.  This forces users to install the helper beforehand which is undesirable for ruleset authors to force upon users.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n\nCLI, Loading API, Rules API\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nOur two rulesets suffer from this because `rctx.download[_and_extract]` does not support setting arbitrary headers to be sent over the HTTP requests. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17829, therefore we are forced to use credential helpers to be able to set custom headers. \r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is that it is easy to tell users to add a few lines to their bazelrc which will add headers based on our custom logic using a bash script.\r\n\r\nFor example, i can tell users to add these to their bazelrc\r\n\r\n```\r\n--credential_helper=\".*dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org.*=bash -c '{\\\"headers\\\": {}}'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas telling them to install an obscure binary from the internet.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\ndarwin/arm64\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.3.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1713463800","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17829#issuecomment-1713463800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17829","id":1713463800,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5mIWH4","user":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-11T08:58:05Z","updated_at":"2023-09-11T08:58:05Z","body":"@meteorcloudy Do you see any potential issues with allowing `rctx.download[_and_extract]` to set arbitrary headers? \r\n\r\n@thesayyn Would you be interested in contributing this functionality if you get the okay from maintainers?
