In this case, an absolute path to the source file will be stamped into the `runfiles_manifest`. However, if we run 2 builds from 2 different clones of the same repo, on the same commit, with `output_user_root` and `output_base` set to the same paths on both builds, then the `runfiles_manifest` will be incorrectly cached for the second clone / build. The `runfiles_manifest` on the second clone / build will contain a reference to the absolute path of the inputted source file located in the first clone.\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nCreate 2 identical bazel workspaces containing a simple `sh_binary` that references a source file in 2 different folders. Build both targets with `--output_user_root` and `--output_base` set to the same folders on both. Check the 2 different `runfiles_manifest` files and they will contain the same absolute path. That of the source file from the first one built. \r\n\r\nA minimal example can be found here: https://github.com/JesseTatasciore/bazel-manifest-caching-repro\r\n\r\nI added a simple script named `bazel_repro.sh` which will perform the instructions I mentioned above (create the clones, run the builds and `cat` the different `manifest_runfiles` files)\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nConfirmed on `macOS Monterey` (Apple M1) and `Amazon Linux 2` (`centos`). Please note that I have not tried on any other OS's\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 6.0.0\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nNo\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nThis is some output of the script I mentioned in the minimal repro I provided:\r\n```\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nFirst Build PWD\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n/Users/jesse/Development/bazel-manifest-caching-repro/test/test1/bazel-manifest-caching-repro\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nFirst Build runfiles_manifest\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nrepro/hello_world /Users/jesse/Development/bazel-manifest-caching-repro/test/outputs/__main__/execroot/repro/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/hello_world\r\nrepro/hello_world.sh /Users/jesse/Development/bazel-manifest-caching-repro/test/test1/bazel-manifest-caching-repro/hello_world.sh\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nSecond Build PWD\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n/Users/jesse/Development/bazel-manifest-caching-repro/test/test2/bazel-manifest-caching-repro\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nSecond Build runfiles_manifest\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nrepro/hello_world /Users/jesse/Development/bazel-manifest-caching-repro/test/outputs/__main__/execroot/repro/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/hello_world\r\nrepro/hello_world.sh /Users/jesse/Development/bazel-manifest-caching-repro/test/test1/bazel-manifest-caching-repro/hello_world.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom which, you can see that the absolute path under `Second Build runfiles_manifest` does not match the output from `Second Build PWD` as it should. It has `test1` from `First Build PWD` instead of the expected `test2`","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
