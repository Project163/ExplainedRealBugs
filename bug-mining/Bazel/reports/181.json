It appears to fail to resolve a path it constructs.\r\n\r\nReverting to Bazel 6.4.0, or passing the `--noincompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` build option, are both successful workarounds.\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n0. Ubuntu 20.04.\r\n1. Download `bazelisk-linux-amd64` from https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/tag/v1.19.0, add it to your PATH, and make it executable.\r\n2. Clone https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples, and change into the `examples/cpp-tutorial/stage1` directory.\r\n3. Execute `bazelisk-linux-amd64 build //main:hello-world`.\r\n4. As part of the build failure output, receive the following error message:\r\n```\r\nexternal/gcc_toolchain_x86_64/bin/gcc: line 45: /tmp/external/gcc_toolchain_x86_64_files/bin/x86_64-linux-gcc: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nUbuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 7.0.0\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/examples\r\nmaster\r\nfatal: ambiguous argument 'master': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.\r\nUse '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:\r\n'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'\r\n9c4e6c5de1a053efa956c0a7a8f54d302d24e0b1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?
