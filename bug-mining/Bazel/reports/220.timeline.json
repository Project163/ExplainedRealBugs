Description of the bug:\n\n\nThis is the same as https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13229, except it seems to have resurfaced with `--remote_download_toplevel` (or `--remote_download_minimal`) enabled. Since `--remote_download_toplevel` enabled by default in bazel 7.x+, it occurs in the default configuration of bazel 7.x+ if remote cache is enabled.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, if I have an action that creates a directory artifact, and then I replace it with a different action that creates a file in the directory, that action will fail because bazel fails to add write permissions to the directory. I can work around this with `bazel clean`, but that is prohibitively expensive for large repos.\r\n\r\nThe error looks like:\r\n```\r\nERROR: BUILD.bazel:8:8: Action foobar/foobar2 failed: I/O exception during sandboxed execution: Could not move output artifacts from sandboxed execution\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe original issue was supposed to be fixed in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/cff2ea55dafc57d7d2db813522942e2ee137ed08, but it seems like that logic isn't being used when `--remote_download_toplevel` is enabled.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nLocal Execution\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nCreate the workspace from this gist: https://gist.github.com/william-smith-skydio/654bfe393e9388bb11c2c2f32f60628c\r\n\r\nRun:\r\n```\r\nbazel build //:foobar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will succeed. Now change `use_dir` to `False` for the `foobar` rule and re-run:\r\n```\r\nbazel build //:foobar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fails:\r\n```\r\nERROR: BUILD.bazel:8:8: Action foobar/foobar2 failed: I/O exception during sandboxed execution: Could not move output artifacts from sandboxed execution\r\nTarget //:foobar failed to build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output directory has these permissions (the directory is missing write permissions):\r\n```\r\n$ ls -lh bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/ \r\ntotal 4.0K\r\ndr-xr-xr-x 2 williamsmith williamsmith 4.0K Aug 28 15:24 foobar\r\n```\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nUbuntu 18.04\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\n7.3.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nOther potentially-related issues:\r\n * https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13229\r\n * https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20032\r\n * https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22260\r\n * https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23283\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nThis issue is present in 7.3.1 and 8.0.0-pre.20240821.2 with remote cache enabled (since `--remote_download_toplevel` is default). In the above reproducer I use `--disk_cache` for simplicity, but it also happens with a proper remote cache. The issue is also present in 6.4.0 if I enable `--remote_download_toplevel`, but for whatever reason I couldn't reproduce with `--disk_cache`, only a proper remote cache.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2408133601","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23283#issuecomment-2408133601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23283","id":2408133601,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc6PiTPh","user":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-11T21:19:52Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T21:19:52Z","body":"A fix for this issue has been included in [Bazel 7.4.0 RC1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/7.4.0rc1).
