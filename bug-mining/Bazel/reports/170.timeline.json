Description of the problem / feature request:\r\n\r\nWhen referencing a `bool_flag` in a `config_setting` via an `alias` indirection, the flag value set on the command line seems to be ignored.\r\nNOTE: it isn't necessarily only broken for `bool_flags`, but that's just a simple example that illustrate the issue. I suspect other flag types would have the same problem.\r\n\r\n### Feature requests: what underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\r\n\r\nI want to enable some sort of late-binding for enabling/disabling features, in a way that would 'point' to different workspaces based on a flag (boolean or otherwise). Since `select()` isn't possible in a `WORKSPACE`, it seems that a recommended alternative is to go through a `select`, `config_setting` + `alias` indirection. \r\nI have tried to simplify my example to a minimum size, so this doesn't exactly illustrate what I'm trying to archive, but it does illustrate the bug I see when following that approach\r\n\r\n### Bugs: what's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\nWith the following files, run `run_all.sh` which will run 4 builds, one by one, and execute the result, printing `feature a: 0` or `feature a: 1` depending on the outcome of the `select` in the `BUILD` file.\r\nAs we can see, we get `0` and `1` (depending on the `--//:enable_feature_a=xxx` command line option) when the `select` is for a `config_setting` that references a `bool_flag` directly, but we always get `0` regardless of the command line option when using a `config_setting` that references a `bool_flag` via an alias.\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ cat WORKSPACE \r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"bazel_skylib\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n
