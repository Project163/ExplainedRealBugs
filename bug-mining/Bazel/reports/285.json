This will result in a failure if there's a reference to those rules or symbols.\nWARNING: Couldn't auto load rules or symbols, because no dependency on module/repository 'rules_android' found. This will result in a failure if there's a reference to those rules or symbols.\n```\n\nWe're not actively using either of these rules in our codebase, but I wouldn't rule out that we have them as transitive dependencies in our dependency tree.\nWe're using bzlmod, our WORKSPACE file exists and is empty.\n\nHow can we silence these warnings? They are not helpful for us, and I'd be reluctant to roll out this upgrade to our users, as they'll be confused by warnings that aren't actionable or relevant to them.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
