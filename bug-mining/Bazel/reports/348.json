When repository contents cache is enabled, this can result in mismatched content.\n\nAt the same time, no message (like `canonical reproducible form can be obtained by`) is shown when these integrity values are absent.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nExternal Dependency\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\n1. Create a file with some data (`file://` will be used for simplicity):\n   ```shell\n   $ cat /path/to/test.txt\n   some data\n   ```\n\n2. `MODULE.bazel` (the archive itself is irrelevant):\n   ```bazel\n   module(name = \"mymodule\")\n\n   http_archive = use_repo_rule(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\n   http_archive(\n       name = \"myrepo\",\n       url = \"URL of any archive\",\n       integrity = \"integrity of the archive\",\n       remote_file_urls = {\n           \"test.txt\": [\"file:///path/to/test.txt\"],\n       },\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. Fetch `myrepo`:\n   ```shell\n   $ bazel query @myrepo//...\n   $ cat \"$(bazel info output_base)\"/external/*myrepo*/test.txt\n   some data\n   ```\n\n4. Change `test.txt`:\n   ```shell\n   $ cat /path/to/test.txt\n   other data\n   ```\n\n5. Clean and re-run Bazel:\n   ```shell\n   $ bazel clean --expunge && rm MODULE.bazel.lock\n   $ bazel query @myrepo//...\n   $ cat \"$(bazel info output_base)\"/external/*myrepo*/test.txt\n   some data\n   ```\n   But the content should be `other data`.\n\nWhen repository contents cache is disabled, output is as expected:\n```shell\n$ cat /path/to/test.txt\nsome data\n$ bazel query --repo_contents_cache= @myrepo//...\n$ cat \"$(bazel info output_base)\"/external/*myrepo*/test.txt\nsome data\n\n$ cat /path/to/test.txt\nother data\n$ bazel clean --expunge && rm MODULE.bazel.lock\n$ bazel query --repo_contents_cache= @myrepo//...\n$ cat \"$(bazel info output_base)\"/external/*myrepo*/test.txt\nother data\n```\n\nThe same thing is applicable to remote patches - while they require an integrity string to be set, it can be set to an empty string, which disables integrity check in `repository_ctx.download()`.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nUbuntu 22.04\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.3.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\nExpected unset integrity of remote files/patches to be either an error or correctly accounted for when returning `reproducible = True`.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26694/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
