Continue to disallow `include()` as part of BCR published repositories.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\nUnder bzlmod `include()` is only allowed in the root module. This makes it impossible to split the `MODULE.bazel` files of rulesets which use extensive dev dependencies up into manageable bits using includes and test them via `local_path_override` and such.\n\nConsider a ruleset which uses `rules_rust` to create prebuilds of tools which are then embedded into the released form of the ruleset via `multitool` at which point `rules_rust` and the LLVM toolchains and such required to generate prebuilds can (should!) be discarded as dev-only MODULE configuration. It would be convenient to use say `bazel/includes/rust.MODULE.bazel` and `bazel/includes/llvm.MODULE.bazel` for such fragments. This works great within a central repo but is effectively broken when developing non-root repos.\n\nIt's possible to preprocess `MODULE.bazel` files as part of BCR releases to eliminate `include()` calls which are relevant only to development, but there's no good workaround for source development. Consider wanting to `local_path_override` such a repo in for development testing.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/27137/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/27137/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
