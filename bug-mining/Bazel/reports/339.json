With repo contents cache PRs cherry-picked, we can now start removing WORKSPACE logic from HEAD. This will remove a great deal of maintenance burden, and allow us to clean up age-old tech debt.\n\nList of user-visible changes:\n- The WORKSPACE file will no longer be read or processed. It will remain a repo boundary marker file for backwards compatibility.\n- The `bazel sync` command will be removed. It's replaced by `bazel fetch --all`.\n- Several fields will disappear from the `native` object in .bzl files loaded for module extensions and repo rules, including `native.register_toolchains`, `native.bind`, etc. These never worked, but the fields were there; they'll be removed.\n- The flags surrounding the \"resolved workspace file\" (`--experimental_resolved_file_instead_of_workspace`, `--experimental_repository_resolved_file`) are deleted.\n- The output of `bazel mod show_repo` will no longer contain meaningless stack traces.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26131/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
