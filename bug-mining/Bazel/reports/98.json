All the other workflows already declare top-level read-only permissions and grant extra permissions at the jobs that require them.\r\n\r\nThis issue can be solved in two ways:\r\n- add top-level read-only permissions to both workflows; and/or\r\n- set the default token permissions to read-only in the repo settings.\r\n\r\nI'll be sending a PR along with this issue that sets the top-level permissions. If you instead (or also) wish to modify the default token permissions:\r\n\r\n1. Open the repo settings\r\n2. Go to [Actions > General](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/settings/actions)\r\n3. Under \"Workflow permissions\", set them to \"Read repository contents and packages permissions\"\r\n\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
