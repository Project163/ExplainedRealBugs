Description of the problem / feature request:\r\n\r\nCurrently, if a rule has a private tool that it needs to invoke as part of its logic, this tool needs to have public visibility since visibility resolution is per target, not per rule.\r\n\r\nBazel should support a mechanism to allow any target of a specific rule to have access to the private tools/dependencies, but not having to expose these dependencies publicly.\r\n\r\nTake for example: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/master/tools/codesigningtool/BUILD#L9\r\n\r\nThere's no available mechanism through which to make this target private to instances of `ios_application`, since this rule can be created in any package and maintaining a whitelist is a huge burden.\r\n\r\n### Feature requests: what underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\r\n\r\nLack of visibility enforcement and needing to expose all internals of rules into potential abuse, making it harder to control affected targets and therefore make
