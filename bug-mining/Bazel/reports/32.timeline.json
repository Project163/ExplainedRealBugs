CL harmonizes the criteria for permitting a symlink for locally and remotely produced tree artifacts, namely:\r\n\r\n1. A symlink to an absolute path is allowed.\r\n2. A symlink to a relative path is allowed, as long as the target is inside the tree artifact.\r\n3. The target path must exist (a consequence of tree artifacts transparently dereferencing symlinks; see also #15454).\r\n\r\nas enforced by TreeArtifactValue#visitTree (see https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/TreeArtifactValue.java;l=585;drc=de9d1f59915a36229978d46b78a22c9e5389db92).\r\n\r\nThe admonition about symlinks potentially compromising hermeticity is still valid, but there's little gain in making the behavior divergent between local and remote execution. I don't believe we can go in the other direction and extend the restriction to cover local execution, as it would break existing projects.\r\n\r\nThe --incompatible_remote_disallow_symlink_in_tree_artifact flag is deleted. It was added at a time when symlink resolution was extremely unreliable when building without the bytes; the state of symlink handling has improved a lot since then. I'm deleting the flag entirely (as opposed to making it a no-op) because it was only introduced in the Bazel 7 tree and hasn't made it into a stable release yet.\r\n\r\nMakes #18284 obsolete.\r\n\r\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 587691220\r\nChange-Id: I470a8fc523bdbb7577ad5a564b6b2c0acab17d7d","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11140620057,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc5k3c3TzwAAAAKYCF8Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/11140620057","actor":{"login":"keertk","id":110264242,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpJ_sg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110264242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk","html_url":"https://github.com/keertk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keertk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d54043ece9ce72f2d17c673a6ba55110af1c9db3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/d54043ece9ce72f2d17c673a6ba55110af1c9db3","created_at":"2023-12-04T15:17:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11140669237,"node_id":"RTE_lADOATz7jc5k3c3TzwAAAAKYCR81","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/11140669237","actor":{"login":"tjgq","id":4370077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4370077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq","html_url":"https://github.com/tjgq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjgq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-04T15:21:02Z","rename":{"from":"incompatible_remote_disallow_symlink_in_tree_artifact","to":"[OBSOLETE] incompatible_remote_disallow_symlink_in_tree_artifact"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
