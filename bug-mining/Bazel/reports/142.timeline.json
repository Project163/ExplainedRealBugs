An idea from the sidelines: Since the stub script knows best whether it created a manifest jar, it could pass along its path as an environment variable or Java system property.\r\n\r\nSince the original solution already depends on an environment variable being passed along (`$JACOCO_IS_JAR_WRAPPED`), it could probably just pass the name of the wrapped jar instead.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1941555757/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"c-mita","id":3749031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDkwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3749031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita","html_url":"https://github.com/c-mita","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"c-mita","id":3749031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDkwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3749031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita","html_url":"https://github.com/c-mita","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-mita/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-15T11:37:43Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T11:37:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21365","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21365/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21365/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21365/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21365","id":2136309432,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATz7jc5m9wFq","number":21365,"title":"Pass

the java classpath exceeds the limit, we create a manifest JAR\r\nand pass that on the classpath. JacocoCoverageRunner knows how to\r\nextract information from this JAR. But if another JAR ends up on that\r\nclasspath, it confuses the coverage runner which is expecting only a\r\nsingle jar in this case.\r\n\r\nThis changes the java_stub_template file to export the name of the\r\ncreated manifest jar so the coverage runner can extract it.\r\n\r\nWe also change the template file so the relevant exports don't occur\r\nin the middle of a larger function.\r\n\r\nIt's possible this is somewhat overengineered and that we could\r\nalways rely on the manifest jar always being the first one discovered\r\nby the coverage runner, but it is not totally obvious to me that that\r\nwill always be true.\r\n\r\nFixes
