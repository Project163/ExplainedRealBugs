Description of the bug:\n\n\nIf you modify which target a label flag points to in a transition, Bazel will fail to invalidate the cache.\r\n\r\nI verified this bug is present in versions `8.0.0-pre.20240618.2` and https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/0ddcfd327ffd012d348deeae08ec0836409706ad.

Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/tpudlik/label_flag_transition_cache_bug\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\nLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 8.0.0-pre.20240618.2\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\n\n\nYes, it's a regression, but it's a little tricky to construct the `--bisect` for it because it's a caching issue. I decided to file it before figuring one out. Sorry!\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\nSeemed related to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22995, but the fix for that issue doesn't fix this one.\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23097/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"katre","id":326527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre","html_url":"https://github.com/katre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-24T19:44:54Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T19:44:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23101","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23101/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23101/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23101/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23101","id":2428347695,"node_id":"I_kwDOATz7jc6QvaUv","number":23101,"title":"Better handling for caches in skyfunctions","user":{"login":"katre","id":326527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre","html_url":"https://github.com/katre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":106503261,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDY1MDMyNjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/type:%20feature%20request","name":"type: feature request","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":192364170,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTIzNjQxNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/P2","name":"P2","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":"We'll consider working on this in future.

have several caches used currently in skyfunction implementations, with many specifically, used directly or indirectly from `ConfiguredTargetFunction`. Some examples are:\r\n- [`StarlarkTransitionCache`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/StarlarkTransitionCache.java?ss=bazel&q=caffeine&start=31)\r\n- [`BuildConfigurationKeyCache`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/producers/BuildConfigurationKeyCache.java?ss=bazel&q=caffeine&start=41)\r\n- [`PlatformMappingValue.parserCache`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/config/PlatformMappingValue.java;drc=0803ad3770155be411a703950502dc71743017bd;l=152?ss=bazel&q=caffeine&start=21)\r\n- [`StarlarkDefinedConfigTransition.ruleTransitionCache`](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/StarlarkDefinedConfigTransition.java?q=symbol%3A%5Cbcom.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.StarlarkDefinedConfigTransition.ruleTransitionCache%5Cb%20case%3Ayes)\r\n\r\nEach of these are used to cache expansive computations that may be repeated multiple times in the same build (ie, in one `bazel build` call). Each of these would ideally also persist from build to build in case the same computation is needed across builds.\r\n\r\nWe've also seen several classes of error arising from the files used to determine cache values being changed between builds, but the cache not being invalidated:\r\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22995 - Flags from `platform` weren't re-computed when the underlying BUILD file changed\r\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23097 - Transitions weren't re-computed when the underlying bzl file changed.\r\n\r\nThere may well be more of these.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13885479299,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6PRDjszwAAAAM7o5mD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13885479299","actor":{"login":"yperess","id":9535482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MzU0ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9535482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess","html_url":"https://github.com/yperess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yperess/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9e3c146572bf49ee0e873ff9409241a3a7eb1f65","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taliperess/mymom-health/commits/9e3c146572bf49ee0e873ff9409241a3a7eb1f65","created_at":"2024-08-14T18:42:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
