can apply an optimization where it compiles the source files only against direct dependencies, making use of the fact that Turbine includes sufficient information about transitive dependencies into the direct header jars in a special directory.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that downstream consumers of header compilation action can use its `.jdeps` file regardless of which of these actions actually uses path mapping, all such paths to transitive jars have to be unmapped.\r\n\r\nWith this commit, actions can declare additional artifacts whose paths they want to apply path mapping to. By always passing all transitive jars into the path mapper, even when only the direct jars are inputs to the action, the transitive header jar paths can be unmapped and stripped path collisions between them correctly result in a noop `PathMapper` being used for the current action.\r\n\r\nFixes

can apply an optimization where it compiles the source files only against direct dependencies, making use of the fact that Turbine includes sufficient information about transitive dependencies into the direct header jars in a special directory.\n\nIn order to ensure that downstream consumers of header compilation action can use its `.jdeps` file regardless of which of these actions actually uses path mapping, all such paths to transitive jars have to be unmapped.\n\nWith this commit, actions can declare additional artifacts whose paths they want to apply path mapping to. By always passing all transitive jars into the path mapper, even when only the direct jars are inputs to the action, the transitive header jar paths can be unmapped and stripped path collisions between them correctly result in a noop `PathMapper` being used for the current action.\n\nFixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21091\n\nCloses #19872.\n\nCommit https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/fd196bf03f4301cc3fbfc307570637f4de71c82c\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 604772306\nChange-Id: I21d25785b2e909aace8554251f41b1012185138a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1930929931","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21091#issuecomment-1930929931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21091","id":1930929931,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5zF6cL","user":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-06T23:16:43Z","updated_at":"2024-02-06T23:16:43Z","body":"Reopening, I accidentally left the issue reference in the PR description even after you confirmed the error.
