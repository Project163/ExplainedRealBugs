we weren't creating input files for labels used in the attribute of a top-level symbolic macro. This meant that if you wrote\n\n```\nmy_macro(\n    name = \"foo\",\n    srcs = [\"input.txt\"],\n)\n```\n\nyou'd get an error message claiming that input.txt is not declared and requires an `exports_files()`. (The usages of input.txt by targets declared inside of foo don't count, because implicit input file creation only works for usages of labels outside of symbolic macro bodies.)\n\nThis CL fixes this behavior, refactors the relevant logic in Package.java, and adds more test coverage.\n\nPackage.java:\n- Factor the big for loop from `beforeBuild()` to `createAssumedInputFiles()`. Leave the original for loop in place for test suite accumulation, and pull the `if (discover...)` out of the new call.\n- Factor the meat of the logic into a helper, `maybeCreateAssumedInputFile()`, so we can reuse it for both rules and macros (previously there was no loop over references in macros).\n- Add tedious javadoc to this tedious logic.\n\nSymbolicMacroTest.java\n- Add explanatory comment to `macroCanReferToInputFile()`.\n- Expand `macroCannotForceCreationOfImplicitInputFileOnItsOwn()` to check that the target is still not created when the inner usage is in an attr of a MacroInstance rather than a Rule.\n\nPackageFactoryTest.java\n- Expand comment in `testSymbolicMacro_macroPreventsImplicitCreationOfInputFilesUnderItsNamespace()`, include coverage for when the reference comes from within a target or submacro inside the symbolic macro itself.\n- New test case for the behavior of this CL, `..._macroInstantiationCanForceImplicitCreationOfInputFile()`.\n- Drive-by: Add a test case for when a badly named target in a symbolic macro clashes with an implicitly created input file. This behavior may be affected by lazy macro evaluation in the future.\n\nConfirmed that this CL works for the case I originally discovered it on while writing examples documentation.\n\nFixes #24007.\n\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 686919555\nChange-Id: I6313070f76456c0b0b5d5458ca35c89d1d6da33b\n\nCommit https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/2b9a2e79d57fbae57337f2afdabb44bdad7d33f4","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24027/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14703309734,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6ahMeFzwAAAANsYrOm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/14703309734","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c72995a624d8b1caea60ad179e886ae618223630","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/c72995a624d8b1caea60ad179e886ae618223630","created_at":"2024-10-17T17:57:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2442878717","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24007#issuecomment-2442878717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24007","id":2442878717,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc6Rm179","user":{"login":"iancha1992","id":132618328,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-eYWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132618328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992","html_url":"https://github.com/iancha1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iancha1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-28T23:44:04Z","updated_at":"2024-10-28T23:44:04Z","body":"A fix for this issue has been included in [Bazel 8.0.0 RC2](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/8.0.0rc2).
