What happened?\r\n\r\nI have documented the very confusing effects of this problem just an hour or so ago on https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/issues/1546#issuecomment-2269842960. Very shortly after that, I identified this flag as the problem and a week of debugging comes to a close!\r\n\r\nI am unsure if this is related to rules_js 2.x, or Bazel 7 and what mix of these might trigger this problem. Primarily because this is a part of a large simultaneous upgrade. But I can say it happens on rules_js 2.0.0-rc9 combined with Bazel 7. \r\n\r\nI feel it is more likely related to a change in Bazel 7 and may apply to older versions of rules_js too. [This change](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/7b87ae1b81b681d4fc7e42282b6966fbcaf6301c) to the `--experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` flags behaviour was made in Bazel 7.0. See the [thread](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4327) for more details. However, this is speculation. In the interest of caution, I have added a note on that thread about this issue **as its being proposed to turn this flag on by default in Bazel 7.3.0**.\r\n\r\nIn my case the problem manifests in the following situation, but it is doubtful to be limited to just this:\r\n\r\n1. `--experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` is enabled.\r\n1. A PNPM workspace with an application package with depends on another internal workspace package. \r\n2. The internal workspace package has many runtime deps in its `package.json`. These are also declared on the `data` attribute of the `npm_package`.\r\n3. In the app `package.json` there is a `workspace:*` dependency to the shared package.\r\n4. In the app package, there are `js_binary` targets connected to `js_library` targets. Those `js_library` targets specify the `:node_modules/@example/shared-pkg` in their `data` attributes.\r\n\r\nDue to `--experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation`, symlinks are created differently. This happens all the way down the dependency tree in `node_modules` and I've also seen sandbox escape back to the source files in certain configurations.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen by executing commands along the lines of (masked some info)\r\n\r\n```\r\nls -la /private/var/tmp/_bazel_xxxxxxxx/c84d9fb447025e8f818c667552514689/execroot/_main/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/xxx-workspace-root-parent-xxx/xxx-workspace-root-xxx/xxx-app-package-xxx/bin_/bin.runfiles/_main/xxx-workspace-root-parent-xxx/xxx-workspace-root-xxx/node_modules/.aspect_rules_js/xxx-my-shared-pkg-name-xxx@0.0.0/node_modules\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `--experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` turned on, symlinks look like this (snippet + masked):\r\n\r\n```\r\naxios -> /private/var/tmp/_bazel_xxxxxxxx/c84d9fb447025e8f818c667552514689/execroot/_main/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/ui-plane/xxx-workspace-root-xxx/node_modules/.aspect_rules_js/xxx-my-shared-pkg-name-xxx@0.0.0/node_modules/axios\r\nbody-parser -> /private/var/tmp/_bazel_xxxxxxxx/c84d9fb447025e8f818c667552514689/execroot/_main/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/ui-plane/xxx-workspace-root-xxx/node_modules/.aspect_rules_js/xxx-my-shared-pkg-name-xxx@0.0.0/node_modules/body-parser\r\ncombined-stream -> /private/var/tmp/_bazel_xxxxxxxx/c84d9fb447025e8f818c667552514689/execroot/_main/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/ui-plane/xxx-workspace-root-xxx/node_modules/.aspect_rules_js/xxx-my-shared-pkg-name-xxx@0.0.0/node_modules/combined-stream\r\nconnect-redis -> /private/var/tmp/_bazel_xxxxxxxx/c84d9fb447025e8f818c667552514689/execroot/_main/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/ui-plane/xxx-workspace-root-xxx/node_modules/.aspect_rules_js/xxx-my-shared-pkg-name-xxx@0.0.0/node_modules/connect-redis\r\ncookie-parser -> /private/var/tmp/_bazel_xxxxxxxx/c84d9fb447025e8f818c667552514689/execroot/_main/bazel-out/darwin_arm64-fastbuild/bin/ui-plane/xxx-workspace-root-xxx/node_modules/.aspect_rules_js/xxx-my-shared-pkg-name-xxx@0.0.0/node_modules/cookie-parser\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `--experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` turned off, symlinks look like this (snippet):\r\n\r\n```\r\naxios -> ../../axios@1.6.5/node_modules/axios\r\nbody-parser -> ../../body-parser@1.19.0/node_modules/body-parser\r\ncombined-stream -> ../../combined-stream@1.0.8/node_modules/combined-stream\r\nconnect-redis -> ../../connect-redis@5.1.0/node_modules/connect-redis\r\ncookie-parser -> ../../cookie-parser@1.4.6/node_modules/cookie-parser\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter works great. The former does not, throwing lots of module not found errors. I beleive it is considered a sandbox escape by the node fs patches.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\nDevelopment (host) and target OS/architectures: MacOSX 14.5\r\n\r\nOutput of `bazel --version`: 7.2.1\r\n\r\nVersion of the Aspect rules, or other relevant rules from your\r\n`WORKSPACE` or `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_nodejs\", version = \"6.2.0\")\r\n\r\nnode = use_extension(\"@rules_nodejs//nodejs:extensions.bzl\", \"node\", dev_dependency = True)\r\nnode.toolchain(node_version = \"20.11.1\")\r\n\r\n\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"aspect_bazel_lib\", version = \"2.7.8\")\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"aspect_rules_js\", version = \"2.0.0-rc9\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nLanguage(s) and/or frameworks involved: Typescript, Javascript, PNPM workspaces\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\nSee above but more details and musing can be found at https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/issues/1546#issuecomment-2269842960.\r\n\r\nEnsure `build --experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` is in your `.bazelrc`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Any other information?\r\n\r\nI can happily no longer use this flag, which I am doing now. But it should be blocked/documented or fixed.\r\n\r\nI also found it can be worked around (if you for some reason must keep this flag) by using `patch_node_fs = False` on `js_binary` but thats probably very dangerous, as like I said, I've actually seen symlinks at times linking out to the src tree.\r\n\r\nDebugging the problem has been hard because once the symlinks are bad like this, the behaviour of future ops/changes whilst the flag remains on seems to be non-hermetic and you need to `rm -rf` some stuff in `bazel-out` before having another workaround attempt since doing so \"changes the errors\". I was trying crazy stuff like shoving the workspace `node_modules` into the `js_binary`'s `data` attribute. But of course, I now know any \"workaround\" is futile.\r\n\r\nAlso I don't know enough about the matter at hand to say, but its quite possible this issue is with Bazel 7 and there is nothing to fix here. If so, I'm happy to move this there.\r\n\r\nSide point, but this would of been so much easier for me to realise if this type of \"module not found\" errors coming from node were supplemented by a an additional message/log (in some kinda of debug mode?) to say they would have resolved if not for the fs patch and why they were rejected/where it expected stuff to be contained within. I'm guessing that the symlinks go to an absolute path and not a relative one is possibly a key invariant that could be stated. As without this realisation, the paths often look plausible.\r\n\r\nNote this flag is actually mentioned by aspect as one to (possibly) enable:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.aspect.build/guides/bazelrc/#notes\r\nhttps://blog.aspect.build/bazelrc-flags","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aspect-build/rules_js/issues/1877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aspect-build/rules_js/issues/1877/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13956425434,"node_id":"CE_lADOATz7jc6TWTxnzwAAAAM_3iba","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13956425434","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"51d7a3c7e549780a7f162bfe6525fffc4c529ae0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/51d7a3c7e549780a7f162bfe6525fffc4c529ae0","created_at":"2024-08-21T08:19:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13956430418,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6TWTxnzwAAAAM_3jpS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13956430418","actor":{"login":"bazel-io","id":15028808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI4ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15028808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io","html_url":"https://github.com/bazel-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazel-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"51d7a3c7e549780a7f162bfe6525fffc4c529ae0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazel-io/bazel/commits/51d7a3c7e549780a7f162bfe6525fffc4c529ae0","created_at":"2024-08-21T08:19:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13974911775,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATz7jc6TWTxnzwAAAANA-Dsf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/13974911775","actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"15a4335e099042671280885df420d3b0fc5c2ca5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmeum/bazel/commits/15a4335e099042671280885df420d3b0fc5c2ca5","created_at":"2024-08-22T10:24:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/u
