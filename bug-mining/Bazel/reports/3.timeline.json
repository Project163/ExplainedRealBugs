Description of the feature request:\r\n\r\nWith Python 2 having been deprecated 2+ years ago, I think it's time to drop support for it in the Python rules.\r\n\r\nThe *main* motivator here is to make re-implementing the rules in Starlark easier: there's a lot of tests and special code that just deals with Python 2: srcs_version compatibility checking, propagation of that, an aspect to identify mismatches, the python_version transition, etc. Re-implementing all that just doesn't make sense for a dead platform.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm filing this issue as a canonical tracking issue to figure out how to go about dropping this support in Bazel.\r\n\r\nAnalogous rules_python issue: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/886\r\n\r\nIt's been decided that Python 2 support will be dropped as part of Bazel 7. This is also to simplify Starlarkifying the Python rules.\r\n\r\nFlag flip tracking issue: #17293\r\n\r\nVarious refs:\r\n *
