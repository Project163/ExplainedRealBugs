Page link:\n\n\nhttps://bazel.build/tutorials/ccp-toolchain-config\n\n### Problem description (include actual vs expected text, if applicable):\n\n\nIn the tutorial under Under _Configure the C++ toolchain_ the last step is:\r\n\r\n> Run `bazel build //main:hello-world --platforms=android_x86_64` to build the binary for Android.\r\n\r\nHowever with Bazel 7.1.1 this command fails with:\r\n```\r\nERROR: /root/examples/cpp-tutorial/stage4/main/BUILD:3:10: com.google.devtools.build.lib.packages.BuildFileNotFoundException: no such package 'android_x86_64': BUILD file not found in any of the following directories. Add a BUILD file to a directory to mark it as a package.\r\n - /root/examples/cpp-tutorial/stage4/android_x86_64\r\nERROR: Analysis of target '//main:hello-world' failed; build aborted\r\nINFO: Elapsed time: 0.111s, Critical Path: 0.00s\r\nINFO: 1 process: 1 internal.\r\nERROR: Build did NOT complete successfully\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the commandline argument has changed, because building works with: `bazel build //main:hello-world --android_platforms=//toolchain:android_x86_64`\n\n### Where do you see this issue?
