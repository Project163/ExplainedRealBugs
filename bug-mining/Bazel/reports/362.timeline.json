/ `ctx.configuration.short_id` ?\n\n- I'm not 100% convinced we need both, especially with `short_id` being a prefix of `id` with a known stable algorithm. But no doubt each has their relative benefits.\n- Seems like a shame to overload this in cquery's `build_options` API. I guess `ctx.configuration.build_options` could work, then update the `build_options` object with whatever info needed.\n\n> Added bonus of being ConfiguredTarget.getConfigurationKey() versus some other hash, is that a user can debug issues with targets by using that hash directly in cquery\n\n+1. We have a canonical hash to represent configuration keys and should keep that canonical.
