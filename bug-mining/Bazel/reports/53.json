Note: I do not mean [\"source-based code coverage\"](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html) (which I believe only has experimental support in Bazel). I mean using the `--coverage` flag when building with Clang, which should produce identical results as GCC. In other words, using clang as a drop-in replacement for GCC.\r\n\r\nCurrently computing coverage fails because Bazel expects `*.gcov.json` files and it cannot find them:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmv: cannot stat '*.gcov.json.gz': No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis comes from this line:\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/test/collect_cc_coverage.sh#L163\r\n\r\nSo even though GCC 9+ does generate .gcov.json files, Clang 9+ does not do so. \r\n\r\nI am using the following relevant flags and settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncoverage --instrument_test_targets\r\ncoverage --combined_report=lcov\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n        tool_path(\r\n            name = \"gcov\",\r\n            path = \"wrapper/llvm-cov\",\r\n        ),\r\n```\r\n\n\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug?
