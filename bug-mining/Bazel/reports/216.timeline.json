same request, trying to download the same object from our cache.\r\n\r\nLuckily, this invocation ran for several minutes. We double-checked and our cache backend was handling plenty of other invocations at the same period without seeing a similar issue.\r\n\r\nThat narrows down the root cause to be client-side.\r\nOur current hypothesis is that: If we deploy multiple cache instances behind a load balancer and one instance goes offline, the load balancer will close the connection by sending RST packets to the Bazel client. We are currently suspecting that somewhere between the stack of `Netty connection -> GoogleChannelConnectionFactory -> SharedConnectionFactory -> DynamicConnectionPool -> ReferenceCountedChannel`, the connection was not properly closed, leading to Bazel retried request without establishing a new connection to our LB to read a new backend instance.\r\n\r\n@coeuvre do you have a suggestion on how we could experiment/verify if that's the case? The issue has not happened consistently so it has been hard for us to

plausible because the connection is reference counted which implies we might reuse the same `SharedConnection` even it's \"closed\" by one of the request.\r\n\r\nI would install a interceptor in the `SharedConnection`

clear the factory state when the connection reset error occurs so the factory can create a new connection for next `acquire`.\r\n\r\nI will be OOO for next two weeks and can work on a patch
