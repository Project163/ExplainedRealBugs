Please provide a minimal example if possible.\n\n\nIn a `.bzl` file containing a module extension, transitively `load` from e.g. `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_utils.bzl`. \r\n\r\nConcretely, I noticed this while working on Bzlmodifying the deps of `bazel_jar_jar` in https://github.com/bazeltools/bazel_jar_jar/blob/main/jar_jar.bzl, which transitively loads `find_java_toolchain`.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse master; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?
