However, I haven't fully groked how that would work.\n\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\n\nConfigurability, Core\n\n### What underlying problem are you trying to solve with this feature?\n\n\n[`rules_python`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python)'s gazelle plugin resides in a [subdirectory of the `rules_python` repo](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/blob/main/gazelle/).\r\n\r\nA naive first attempt at using `git_override` looks like so:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\n# MODULE.bazel\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_python\", version = \"0.31.0\")\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"gazelle\", version = \"0.35.0\", repo_name = \"bazel_gazelle\")\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_python_gazelle_plugin\", version = \"0.31.0\")\r\n\r\ngit_override(\r\n    module_name = \"rules_python\",\r\n    remote = \"https://github.com/dougthor42/rules_python\",\r\n    commit = \"e1677949eca2abe4c37e5f5b2a69529deb44a3d4\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not update `rules_python_gazelle_plugin`. So we try adding that too:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\ngit_override(\r\n    module_name = \"rules_python_gazelle_plugin\",\r\n    remote = \"https://github.com/dougthor42/rules_python\",\r\n    commit = \"e1677949eca2abe4c37e5f5b2a69529deb44a3d4\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut bazel rightly complains that the `module_name` provided does not match the module name of the git repo.\r\n\r\nSo lastly we try to point to the `gazelle` subdir:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\ngit_override(\r\n    module_name = \"rules_python_gazelle_plugin\",\r\n    remote = \"https://github.com/dougthor42/rules_python/gazelle\",\r\n    commit = \"e1677949eca2abe4c37e5f5b2a69529deb44a3d4\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, this fails because `https://github.com/dougthor42/rules_python/gazelle` does not exist.\n\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\n\n\ngLinux\n\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\n\n\nrelease 7.1.1\n\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\n\n\nN/A\n\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\n\n\n```text\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### Have you found anything relevant by searching the web?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22076/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
