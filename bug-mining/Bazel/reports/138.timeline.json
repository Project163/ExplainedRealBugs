Proposal: there should be an API for `npm_translate_lock` to indicate that we believe all the repositories generated by our repository rule calls already meet the desired properties in https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#lockfile-benefits, and omit the `generatedRepoSpecs` altogether.\r\n\r\nThe key action item here is to do exactly this -- in other words, allow a module extension to say \"I don't want to be locked\" in some manner. I've discussed this topic with the rules_python maintainers in some depth, with some more sophisticated ideas thrown around, but this is the first step.\r\n\r\nThe only question to address here would be whether we want this to be a per-extension setting (the extension is either _always locked_ or _never locked_, à la `my_ext = module_extension(..., local=True)`), or a per-extension-evaluation setting (ie. have the extension impl function return a thing saying \"given what has happened this time, I want the result to be locked/not locked\").

In particular in the case of rules_js this is noticeable since it has to parse a potentially large yaml file in Starlark, which can take on the order of 10 seconds for large projects. Ideally, a solution to this issue would resolve this duplication while still maintaining the performance benefit of the lockfile.\r\n\r\nMy idea is a combination of two features that actually share a lot of their implementation complexity:\r\n\r\n* Let Bazel automatically resolve merge conflicts in the lockfile, similar to what yarn does. This essentially just means parsing both \"sides\" of the conflict and keeping all the extension results whose tags still match the current state of the module files. This way, a merge conflict in the lockfile, which is very common due to it including a hash of the root module file, allows the user to preserve the results of unmodified and potentially non-hermetic module extensions.\r\n* Allow module extensions to declare that their current evaluation is reproducible: given the same tags, file deps and implementation function, they will always produce the same repository rule instantiations. Such an extension will not benefit from 1., but may still benefit from 2. and we should aim to support this in our design. I think that this can be achieved by maintaining a second lockfile in the output base which stores the results of only the module extensions marked as reproducible and that is always in `update` mode. Crucially, these results can still be used to speed up the loading phase on server restarts and changes to the root module file, but they will not be contained in the regular MODULE.bazel.lock and thus not be committed (and not cause merge conflicts or duplication).\r\n\r\nBoth of these features require generalizing the Java (not the JSON) representation of the lockfile to an (ordered) list of lockfiles. I prototyped this and found it to add a modest amount of complexity - it even makes some parts of the existing code cleaner and error messages more precise (e.g. the handling of a missing lockfile).\r\n\r\n> The only question to address here would be whether we want this to be a per-extension setting (the extension is either always locked or never locked, à la `my_ext = module_extension(..., local=True)`), or a per-extension-evaluation setting (ie. have the extension impl function return a thing saying \"given what has happened this time, I want the result to be locked/not locked\"). I'm leaning towards the latter as it gives us more flexibility to introduce stuff like \"custom lockfile content\" further on.\r\n\r\nI also think that there is no reason to not make this decision per-evaluation. We already have the API for this in the form of `module_ctx.extension_metadata`, we just need to add a boolean parameter to it. Given the above, I would rather call this parameter `reproducible` instead of `local`.\r\n\r\n> The key action item here is to do exactly this -- in other words, allow a module extension to say \"I don't want to be locked\" in some manner. \r\n\r\nI haven't been able to come up with an example of an extension that would rightfully want to say \"I don't want to be locked\", but isn't reproducible. Knowing that the extension is reproducible allows further optimizations as described above, so I would find this bit safer to add than a catch-all `local`.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1819889397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/1819895193","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20272#issuecomment-1819895193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20272","id":1819895193,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATz7jc5seWWZ","user":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-20T22:18:35Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T22:19:08Z","body":">
