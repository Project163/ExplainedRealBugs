Bazel correctly parses this as 1.1 seconds. However, if the value is `1e0` (or any other value without any decimal point to the left of the `e`), the parsing apparently fails and bazel reports 0 test cases for the entire test (even if only 1 testcase has such a value).\r\n\r\nHaving a no decimal point is generally valid (most langs accept this, I could not find a counter-example at least) and this should be parsed correctly.\r\n\r\nThese values were written by Boost test's JUNIT writer.\r\n\r\n### Which category does this issue belong to?\r\n\r\nCore\r\n\r\n### What's the simplest, easiest way to reproduce this bug? Please provide a minimal example if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate a test that just writes the following to the XML_OUTPUT_DIR location:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<testsuite tests=\"1\" skipped=\"0\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"0\" id=\"0\" name=\"repro\" time=\"0.000938\">\r\n<testcase assertions=\"1\" name=\"repro_tc\" time=\"1e0\">\r\n</testcase>\r\n</testsuite>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Which operating system are you running Bazel on?\r\n\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### What is the output of `bazel info release`?\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease 7.4.0\r\n\r\n### If `bazel info release` returns `development version` or `(@non-git)`, tell us how you built Bazel.\r\n\r\n\r\nI downloaded bazel.\r\n\r\n### What's the output of `git remote get-url origin; git rev-parse HEAD` ?\r\n\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### If this is a regression, please try to identify the Bazel commit where the bug was introduced with bazelisk --bisect.\r\n\r\nDid not attempt.\r\n\r\n### Any other information, logs, or outputs that you want to share?\r\n\r\nJUNIT XML schema seems to define this field as `xs:decimal` type which arguably should not support scientific notation at all, but in any case Bazel is correctly parsing the cases with a decimal point, which seems inconsistent.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
