never thought about this before, but doesn't that show that `--experimental_repository_cache_hardlinks` really is an unsafe optimization? A repo rule doesn't know when it is in effect and may subsequently modify \"downloaded\" files, which can then either poison the cache or fail with this error.\n\n@meteorcloudy @Wyverald Do you see a way to make this safe? We could limit hardlinking to `rctx.download_and_extract`, where it likely provides the biggest benefit and is also safe since the archive file is kept in an internal temp directory. `FileSystemUtils.copyFile` could be improved to use reflinking if available.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/3460429348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20573805049,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc7UXOqKzwAAAATKS1n5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/20573805049","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-29T08:53:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20573805083,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc7UXOqKzwAAAATKS1ob","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/20573805083","actor":{"login":"Wyverald","id":453203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald","html_url":"https://github.com/Wyverald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wyverald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-29T08:53:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20573805124,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc7UXOqKzwAAAATKS1pE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/20573805124","actor":{"login":"meteorcloudy","id":4171702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE3MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy","html_url":"https://github.com/meteorcloudy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meteorcloudy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-29T08:53:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20573805148,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc7UXOqKzwAAAATKS1pc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/20
