in #14268, this flag is very useful for bigger enterprise\ncontext where folks often version bumping dependencies without\nremembering to update the SHA256 of the downloaded file, leading to\nBazel picking up older download entries from the repository cache.\n\nAs we get more questions about this flag in Slack, marking it as\nstable and flip the default seems to be the right

think of this a bit different than @fmeum (in the closed PR).\r\n\r\nImo for WORKSPACE downloads, the download cache deduplication should only matter “much” across source code revisions(git commits) and not within the same revision. In practice, you would want to group most duplication within a single http_archive with multiple URLs, and there is good value into having a URL invalidation scheme.\r\n\r\nHowever I could see a potential fix to this:\r\n- Create a CAS store for download content, potentially the same CAS as disk_cache.\r\n- Make repository_cache (the download cache, not the new proposed cache) to track pointer record to CAS.\r\n\r\nThis means upon download, the archives should be written to CAS, then Bazel should create a pointer to the CAS in repository_cache dir. We could name this repository_download_cache or http_download_cache for good. This means that different http_archive rules downloading the same blob would create different file pointer records pointing to the same object in

This additional indirection is a good idea to avoid unnecessary duplication (in both downloads and storage). \r\n\r\nI think that we should figure out these details before we enable the invalidation in a release. I mostly see two problems with the behavior of `--repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id`:\r\n\r\n1. The invalidation behavior can only realistically catch mistakes if both the list of URLs and the hash are specified by the end user. However, the flag applies on the level of `repository_ctx.download` and thus affects all repository rules, with the vast majority not reaping the benefits as they don't satisfy this condition. Restricting this behavior to `http_*` rules would avoid these kinds of silent performance degradations without benefits.\r\n2. The behavior of the flag is trivial to implement in Starlark: `canonical_id = \" \".join(urls)` is really all it does. Repository rules that satisfy the condition in 1. could just implement this logic themselves.\r\n3. The invalidation scheme makes it so that adding a mirror to an existing repository rule invalidates the cache, which is pretty counter-intuitive. @sluongng's suggestion would help here.\r\n\r\nEven if we think that 3. is acceptable in order to catch a common mistake (I can get behind this), we would probably still be better off by implementing this for `http_*` and in Starlark only.\r\n\r\n(I will flag this for 7.0.0 so that we end up making a conscious decision rather than running out of
