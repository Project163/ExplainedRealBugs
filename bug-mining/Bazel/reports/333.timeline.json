@fmeum Yes, I was in a hurry with the description of problem, I meant invalidating and rebuilding the actions, not downloading itself. I will fix the description.\nInitially the problem was observed with Bazel 7.4.0, and we have seen the real downloads of files from remote cache. When we have found your fix, we tried the same scenario with Bazel 7.6.1. And we still saw the rebuilds for the actions, even though nothing has been changed in environment. This produces several issues.\nLet's consider a case when software developer works on a code locally and incrementally builds the results with Bazel. The whole solution may be large (let's say, 50 000 actions to build), but only a small part of code is subject to change. Most of actions are taken from remote cache. In this case:\n- when TTL expires, Bazel rechecks all that actions, although the source code for those actions has not been changed. This increases the build time.\n- checking the AC with remote cache produces the unnecessary load on a cache server.\n- in case when AC is missing in remote cache, the action will be rebuilt locally although it might not be needed actually.\n- in case when locally rebuilt action produces non-deterministic output (such as .pdb, .pch files), this invalidates the whole tree of actions which depend on it. This might significantly increase the build time.\nThe described behavior may look as unexpected for users, because not all people know about the TTL feature, which is turned on by default with 3h setting.\nThe workaround for issues above is disabling the TTL functionality with `--experimental_remote_cache_ttl` option.\nWe would expect that TTL feature was implemented without invalidating the actions just because they are taken from remote cache. If it is not technically feasible, then we could consider disabling the feature by default, or removing the feature at all.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/comments/2909347896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexanderGolovlev","id":22532709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTMyNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22532709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexanderGolovlev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17812648314,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATz7jc638D9gzwAAAAQlt3F6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/17812648314","actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-26T11:09:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17812648343,"node_id":"SE_lADOATz7jc638D9gzwAAAAQlt3GX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/17812648343","actor":{"login":"fmeum","id":4312191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4312191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum","html_url":"https://github.com/fmeum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fmeum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-26T11:09:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17812657535,"node_id":"RTE_lADOATz7jc638D9gzwAAAAQlt5V_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/events/17812657535","actor":{"login":"AlexanderGolovlev","id":22532709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTMyNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22532709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexanderGolovlev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderGolovlev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-26T11:09:53Z","rename":{"from":"Bazel
