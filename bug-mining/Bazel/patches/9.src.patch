+### Extension identity
+
+Module extensions are identified by the name and the `.bzl` file that appears
+in the call to `use_extension`. In the following example, the extension `maven`
+is identified by the `.bzl` file `@rules_jvm_external//:extension.bzl` and the
+name `maven`:
+
+```python
+maven = use_extension("@rules_jvm_external//:extensions.bzl", "maven")
+```
+
+Re-exporting an extension from a different `.bzl` file gives it a new identity
+and if both versions of the extension are used in the transitive module graph,
+then they will be evaluated separately and will only see the tags associated
+with that particular identity.
+
+As an extension author you should make sure that users will only use your
+module extension from one single `.bzl` file.

 ## Repository names and visibility
 
 Repos generated by extensions have canonical names in the form of `{{ "<var>"
