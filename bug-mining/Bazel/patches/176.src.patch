-
-  - toolchain type requirements of rules are now treated as implicit
-    dependencies in `bazel query`. This includes those defined via
-    the `toolchains` parameter of starlark `rule()` definitions.
-  - Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback,
-    similarly to `sorted`.

-
-New features:
-
-  - New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio
-    toolchains.
-
-Important changes:
-
-  - The result of `canonicalize-flags` now includes all Starlark
-    flags by default. Use `--noexperimental_include_default_values`
-    for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with
-    non-default values.
-  - Added `windows_quoting_for_param_files` feature for windows-style
-    parameter file escaping.

-
-Incompatible changes:
-
-  - Coverage report generators don't get anymore the JAVA_RUNFILES
-    and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.
-  - apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed, use regular cc_toolchain
-  - "bazel query" and "bazel print_action" can't run under the output
-    base anymore.
-  - The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, should_strip_binary
-    in objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent
-    methods
-    objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, objc_should_strip_binary in cpp
-    fragments
-    instead.
-
-New features:
-
-  - Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.
-
-Important changes:
-
-  - Added a new method, `repository_ctx.watch()`, which asks Bazel to
-    watch for changes to an arbitrary file. When said file changes,
-    Bazel will refetch the repo.
-  - `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request
-    conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp`
-    flag).

-
-  - The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates

-  - Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux
-    that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers
-    (on Linux).
-  - The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed
-    to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version
-    updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be
-    public API and can change at any time. See
-    https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_de
-    ps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository
-    names.
-  - The `to_display_form()` method on `Label` returns a string
-    representation of a label optimized for readability by humans.

-  - `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns

-    information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to
-    resolve

-  - The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults
