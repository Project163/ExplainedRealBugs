-**Note:** This section is intended for Bazel developers, and is not needed by

-
-Several SkyFunction classes implement the [toolchain resolution](/extending/toolchains) process:
-
-1.  [`RegisteredToolchainsFunction`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/RegisteredToolchainsFunction.java) and
-    [`RegisteredExecutionPlatformsFunction`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/RegisteredExecutionPlatformsFunction.java)
-    find available toolchains and execution platforms, based on the current
-    configuration and WORKSPACE file.
-
-1.  [`SingleToolchainResolutionFunction`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/SingleToolchainResolutionFunction.java)
-    resolves a single toolchain type for every execution platform. That is, for
-    every execution platform it finds the best registered toolchain to use based
-    on the following criteria:
-
-    1.  Make sure the toolchain and target platform are compatible, by checking
-        the `target_compatible_with` attribute.
-    1.  Make sure the toolchain and execution platform are compatible, by
-        checking the `exec_compatible_with` attribute.
-    1.  If multiple toolchains are left, choose the highest-priority one (the
-        one that was registered first).
-
-1.  [`ToolchainResolutionFunction`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/ToolchainResolutionFunction.java) calls
-    `SingleToolchainResolutionFunction` for each requested toolchain type, and
-    then determines the best execution platform to use.
-
-    1.  First, remove any execution platform that does not have a valid
-        toolchain for each requested toolchain type.
-    2.  If multiple execution platforms are left, choose the highest-priority
-        one (the one that was registered first).
-        1.  If the execution platform is already set by the toolchain
-            transition, it will be selected first as described below.
-
-As discussed in [Toolchains and Configurations](/extending/toolchains#toolchains_and_configurations),
-the dependency from a target to a toolchain uses a special configuration that
-forces the execution platform to be the same for both. Despite the name
-"toolchain transition", this is not implemented as a configuration
-transition, but instead as a special subclass of
-[`ConfiguredTargetKey`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe/ConfiguredTargetKey.java), called

-considering which execution platform to use, if the forced execution platform
-from the `ToolchainDependencyConfiguredTargetKey` is valid, it will be used even
-if it is not the highest-priority.
