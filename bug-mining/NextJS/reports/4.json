If you use this option and do `yarn start` or `yarn dev` you get the following error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n ⚠ Invalid next.config.js options detected: \r\n ⚠     Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'swcMinify'\r\n```\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nNo\n\n### Does the docs page already exist?
