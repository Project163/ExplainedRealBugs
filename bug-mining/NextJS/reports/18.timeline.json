Bug description\n\nThis error occurs when:\n- using `next@15.2.0-canary.40` or above (works on `15.2.0-canary.39` and below)\n- using `next dev --turbopack` (works with `next dev` or `next build` which uses webpack)\n- using custom `output` path in the generator block of `schema.prisma`\n\nNot sure if it's a prisma or turbopack issue?\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. Clone https://github.com/DiPSoMaNiE/next-canary-prisma-issue\n2. Run `bun install`\n3. Run `prisma generate`\n4. Run `bun dev`\n5. Go to `http://localhost:3000` and see error\n\nTo make it work:\n1. Comment the `output   = \"../generated\"` line in `prisma/schema.prisma`\n2. Run `prisma generate`\n3. Change `import { PrismaClient } from '../generated'` to `import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'` in `src/db.ts`\n4. Run `bun dev`\n5. Go to `http://localhost:3000` and see it works\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nEverything should work as expected with a custom output path for the generated PrismaClient.\n\n### Prisma information\n\n`prisma/schema.prisma`\n```prisma\ndatasource db {\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n}\n\ngenerator client {\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\n  output   = \"../generated\"\n}\n\nmodel User {\n  id        String   @id @default(cuid(2))\n  name      String\n  email     String   @unique\n  createdAt DateTime @default(now())\n  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt\n}\n```\n\n`src/db.ts`\n```ts\nimport { PrismaClient } from '../generated'\n\ndeclare const globalThis: typeof global & { db: PrismaClient }\n\nexport const db = globalThis.db ?? new PrismaClient()\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalThis.db = db\n```\n\n`src/app/page.tsx`\n```tsx\nimport { db } from '@/db'\n\nexport default async function Home() {\n  console.log('count', await db.user.count())\n\n  return <>...</>\n}\n```\n\n### Environment & setup\n\n- OS: macOS Sequoia 15.3.1\n- Database: PostgreSQL 17\n- Node.js version: 22.14.0\n\n\n### Prisma Version\n\n```\nprisma                  : 6.4.1\n@prisma/client          : 6.4.1\nComputed binaryTarget   : darwin-arm64\nOperating System        : darwin\nArchitecture            : arm64\nNode.js                 : v22.14.0\nTypeScript              : 5.7.3\nQuery Engine (Node-API) : libquery-engine a9055b89e58b4b5bfb59600785423b1db3d0e75d (at node_modules/@prisma/engines/libquery_engine-darwin-arm64.dylib.node)\nSchema Engine           : schema-engine-cli a9055b89e58b4b5bfb59600785423b1db3d0e75d (at node_modules/@prisma/engines/schema-engine-darwin-arm64)\nSchema Wasm             : @prisma/prisma-schema-wasm 6.4.0-29.a9055b89e58b4b5bfb59600785423b1db3d0e75d\nDefault Engines Hash    : a9055b89e58b4b5bfb59600785423b1db3d0e75d\nStudio                  : 0.509.0\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prisma/prisma/issues/26439/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prisma/prisma/issues/26439/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16464893657,"node_id":"SE_lADOBC3Cis6rmpq6zwAAAAPVYlbZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/16464893657","actor":{"login":"Matth-G","id":148162285,"node_id":"U_kgDOCNTG7Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148162285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G","html_url":"https://github.com/Matth-G","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matth-G/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-25T17:13:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/2687512422","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/76497#issuecomment-2687512422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/76497","id":2687512422,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis6gMC9m","user":{"login":"davecarlson","id":299702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson","html_url":"https://github.com/davecarlson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecarlson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-27T10:21:06Z","updated_at":"2025-02-27T10:21:06Z","body":"Confirmed this also happens in the stable 15.2.0 next release \n```\nTypeError: The \"path\" argument must be of type string.
