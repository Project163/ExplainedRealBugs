rendering the page on Vercel, we send the `x-matched-path` header to indicate which route should be rendered. Sometimes, like in the case of a middleware rewrite, we will rewrite a path to a statically generated one. This results in a `x-matched-path` header being equal to the generated page and not the route with the dynamic path params in it.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that if we get such a path that we match against that we do save the result of the path matching as they are valid parameters.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a related bug associated with route denormalization which must occur before the routes i18n is parsed.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!
