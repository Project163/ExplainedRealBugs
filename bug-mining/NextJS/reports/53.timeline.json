To avoid getting this warning, you'd need to either ensure your application only has 1 lockfile, or alternatively explicitly specify the root of your application in `nextConfig.turbopack.root` ([docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory)). \n\nAs for the implementation details, Turbopack is attempting to locate the root dir of your project and is using lockfiles to do so.  The algorithm recursively looks upward through the filesystem and may catch stray lockfiles in parent directories that don't actually correspond with your application. When you see this warning message, it means that Turbopack inferred the root is the directory of the selected lockfile but we aren't 100% confident that it's the correct root.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/3119986053/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":18819805851,"node_id":"CE_lADOBC3Cis7BfLCOzwAAAARhv3Kb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/18819805851","actor":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-25T18:53:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/3124507028","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/81864#issuecomment-3124507028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81864","id":3124507028,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis66PDGU","user":{"login":"sKopheK","id":5802917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDI5MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5802917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK","html_url":"https://github.com/sKopheK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sKopheK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-27T15:54:36Z","updated_at":"2025-07-27T15:56:17Z","body":"in
