Manual migration required.\n   Could not automatically update the existing flat config.\n   Please manually ensure your ESLint config includes the Next.js configurations\n```\n\nLet me investigate a bit more ~ I noticed the codemod from ESLint does the same 🤔 \n\nTake this with a grain of salt, I've been context switching a lot today, and have my personal opinions on ESLint9+, but if you manually drop the `defineConfig` function, into this\n\n```js\nexport default [\n  { ignores: [\"src/codegen/**/*\", \"src/codegen-pipeline/**/*\",   \"src/components/setup/Distros.tsx\"] },\n  ...compat.extends(\"next/core-web-vitals\"), // I think the prettier compat extend can be remove here, and same with \"next\" and use the core-web-vitals one instead \n  {\n    plugins: {\n      \"react-compiler\": reactCompiler,\n      prettier,\n    },\n    rules: {\n      \"react-compiler/react-compiler\": \"error\",\n      \"prettier/prettier\": \"error\",\n    },\n  },\n];\n```\n\nAnd the codemod will be able to simplify further... but I can relate and understand that this is overwhelming.\n\nNote that you have to manually ignore a bunch of things too, like the lint file
