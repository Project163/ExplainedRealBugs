was able to find a workaround for this issue by creating my own custom link component that wraps the `next/link` component and navigates programmatically via `router.push` from `next/navigation`.

navigation with `useRouter()`.\n\nThis is odd since `next/link` uses the router methods for navigation under the

Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/statico/repro-nextjs-link-get-routes-prefetch\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Build and start the example with `pnpm build && pnpm start` (**not** `pnpm dev`)\n2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`\n3. Observe that clicking on the links sends the wrong query parameters to the test API route\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nIn development mode with `pnpm dev`, the separate links work as expected:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39e7543e-8931-4de1-9970-4f40e8bb89de\n\nIn production mode with `pnpm build && pnpm start`, the API route appears to be prefetched, and all of the links send the browser to **the same URL with the same query parameters:**\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b6694a7-ed20-4798-83e6-0c67b2e49cc8\n\nFurthermore, hovering over the link in production **shows the correct URL even though that's not going to be the one that the browser goes to**:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e9f4fc9-86ab-42db-8992-020da7a74e34)\n\nThis is bewildering, confusing, and is different from the way hypertext links are supposed to work.\n\nYes, I guess this is somewhat documented by https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link#prefetch but it's not clear that adding `prefetch={false}` is the solution.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:22 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6041\n  Available memory (MB): 65536\n  Available CPU cores: 16\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.13.1\n  npm: 10.9.2\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: 10.2.1\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.2.1 // Latest available version is detected (15.2.1).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.0.0\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\n  typescript: N/A\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
