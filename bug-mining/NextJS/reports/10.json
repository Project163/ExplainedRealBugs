Open the example and run it in dev.\r\n2. Verify that nothing is running on port 8000.\r\n3. Open http://localhost:3000/123 in the browser.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nAn error is expected in both places, not just one. Or return a 500 page.\r\n\r\nCurrently, everything works fine if `fetch` is used only in either `Page` or `generateMetadata`. But when both are used together, an error occurs.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: linux\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Dec 27 17:05:33 UTC 2024\r\n  Available memory (MB): 15311\r\n  Available CPU cores: 12\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 22.11.0\r\n  npm: 10.9.0\r\n  Yarn: N/A\r\n  pnpm: 9.15.2\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 15.1.1-canary.27 // Latest available version is detected (15.1.1-canary.27).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 19.0.0\r\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\r\n  typescript: 5.6.2\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nNot sure\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nnext dev (local), next start (local)\n\n### Additional context\n\nWhen a request is made to an unreachable or nonexistent host, one fetch throws an error, while the other hangs indefinitely. Removing the try-catch block does not change the situation.","closed_by":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/74613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/74613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
