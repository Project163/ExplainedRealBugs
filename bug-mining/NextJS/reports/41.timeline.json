NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the `font-family` declaration in `next/font/local` is ignored when specified in `declarations`.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nCurrently, Next.js forces the generated variable name instead of respecting the provided `font-family`.  \r\nThis change ensures that when `font-family` is explicitly set in `declarations`, it is correctly applied in the generated `@font-face` CSS.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n- Updated `loader.ts` to respect the `font-family` declaration if explicitly defined.\r\n- Removed the restriction on `font-family` in `validate-local-font-function-call.ts`.\r\n- Added tests:\r\n  - `loader.test.ts`: Ensures the `font-family` is correctly used when declared.\r\n  - `validate-local-font-function-call.test.ts`: Confirms that `font-family` is now an allowed declaration.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes

team recently ran into this issue as well, and it's preventing us from using the Next.js font API. \n\nIn our case, we are adopting a company-wide component library, in which the font-family value is a string with spaces (i.e. `font-family: Source Sans Pro`). We can't makes changes to the component library, so we want the `font-family` values in the stylesheet output from Next.js to match the values in the component library.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't possible right now, as the `font-family` value is set to the name of the variable of the `localFont` function call (e.g. with the declaration `const SourceSansPro = localFont({ ...options }}`, the `font-family` in the stylesheet output by Next.js becomes `SourceSansPro`.\n\nThis PR would solve our issue, so we hope the Next.js team will consider including it in a release soon:
