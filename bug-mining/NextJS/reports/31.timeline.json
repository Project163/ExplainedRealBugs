What is the documentation issue?\n\nIt says:\r\n\r\n> `sizes=\"any\"` is added to icons when the extension is .svg or the image size of the file is not determined. More details in this [favicon handbook](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs)\r\n\r\nThis is not true. It will add a `sizes=123x123`, where 123x123 is the intrinsic SVG size defined by (in my case at least) the `viewBox` attribute. `sizes=any` would be a better thing to do, since that's what SVG technically is for, but that's not what's happening at the moment.\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nI've noticed this on Next.js 15.0.3, so maybe it has changed from a previous version, in which case it might also be a bug.\n\n### Does the docs page already exist? Please link to it.\n\nhttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/73600/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/73600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17451290736,"node_id":"LE_lADOBC3Cis6z422YzwAAAAQQLZBw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/17451290736","actor":{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-29T09:21:21Z","label":{"name":"linear:
