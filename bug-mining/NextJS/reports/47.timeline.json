a bug\r\n\r\n  - Related issues linked using fixes #81130\r\n  - Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n  - Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n  What?\r\n\r\n  This PR fixes a bug where Next.js Script components with strategy=\"beforeInteractive\" incorrectly render classname attribute instead of the HTML standard class attribute.\r\n\r\n  Why?\r\n\r\n  The beforeInteractive script strategy in App Router bypassed the existing setAttributesFromProps utility function that properly maps React prop names to DOM attribute names. This caused className props to be directly set as classname attributes in the HTML, which is non-standard and breaks CSS styling.\r\n\r\n  Before (broken):\r\n```\r\n  <script classname=\"example-class\" id=\"example\">...</script>\r\n```\r\n  After (fixed):\r\n```\r\n  <script class=\"example-class\" id=\"example\">...</script>\r\n```\r\n  How?\r\n\r\n  1. Identified the root cause: In /packages/next/src/client/app-bootstrap.ts, the loadScriptsInSequence function manually set attributes using a simple loop that didn't handle DOM attribute name mapping.\r\n  2. Applied the fix:\r\n    - Imported the existing setAttributesFromProps utility function\r\n    - Replaced the manual attribute setting loop with the proper utility function call\r\n    - This ensures className → class mapping works correctly\r\n  3. Added comprehensive tests: Created e2e tests in /test/e2e/app-dir/script-before-interactive/ that verify:\r\n    - Single scripts render with correct class attribute\r\n    - Multiple scripts work correctly\r\n    - Script execution remains unaffected\r\n    - Scripts are properly placed in document head\r\n\r\n  Code changes:\r\n```\r\n  // Before (buggy)\r\n  if (props) {\r\n    for (const key in props) {\r\n      if (key !== 'children') {\r\n        el.setAttribute(key, props[key])  // ❌ className becomes classname\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n  // After (fixed)  \r\n```\r\n  if (props) {\r\n    setAttributesFromProps(el, props)  // ✅ className becomes class\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n  Fixes #81130\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81146/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18484476927,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBC3Cis6-UrFRzwAAAARNwrv_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/18484476927","actor":{"login":"Han5991","id":73056306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDU2MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73056306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991","html_url":"https://github.com/Han5991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1060c5bee9b432667c0b51d2495c79843ed2d1e0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Han5991/next.js/commits/1060c5bee9b432667c0b51d2495c79843ed2d1e0","created_at":"2025-07-05T13:11:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18488162329,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBC3Cis6-UrFRzwAAAARN-vgZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/18488162329","actor":{"login":"Han5991","id":73056306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDU2MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73056306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991","html_url":"https://github.com/Han5991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4738c234e9b558859b9d865dc2cc599326a981a2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Han5991/next.js/commits/4738c234e9b558859b9d865dc2cc599326a981a2","created_at":"2025-07-05T22:58:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18490232419,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBC3Cis6-UrFRzwAAAAROGo5j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/18490232419","actor":{"login":"Han5991","id":73056306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDU2MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73056306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991","html_url":"https://github.com/Han5991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"472c3c4a44a5376d624ce652289b6168e052887f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Han5991/next.js/commits/472c3c4a44a5376d624ce652289b6168e052887f","created_at":"2025-07-06T07:10:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18491584893,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBC3Cis6-UrFRzwAAAAROLzF9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/18491584893","actor":{"login":"Han5991","id":73056306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDU2MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73056306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991","html_url":"https://github.com/Han5991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Han5991/starred{/owner
