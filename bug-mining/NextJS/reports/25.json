Clone [this repository](https://github.com/jantimon/reproduction-nextjs-pure-mode)\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n3. Run the development server:\n   ```bash\n   npm run dev\n   ```\n4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser\n5. Click the view transition link\n6. Observe that the global styling features don't work as expected: \n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a0bfc6d-90e2-4a8b-b699-64fbe2073e16)\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrently it is not possible to migrate some `createGlobalStyle` as outside of the `app` / `pages` folder it is not allowed to define global styles\n\nTherefore it is quite hard to migrate css-in-js components to react server components with css modules \n\n```jsx\nimport { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components';\nexport const GlobalTransitions = createGlobalStyle`\n  ::view-transition-old(root) {\n    animation: 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) both fade-out;\n  }\n  /* ... */\n`;\n```\n\nUsually the linting rule helps to structure the code but for these edge-cases it would help us to disable the linting for a dedicated file. The `/* cssmodules-pure-no-check */` pattern mirrors established escape hatches in other tools:\n- `@ts-nocheck` in TypeScript\n- `/* eslint-disable */` in ESLint\n- `// @ts-ignore` for specific lines in TypeScript\n\n`/* cssmodules-pure-no-check */` already exists in the upstream dependencies (`LightningCSS` & `PostCSS`) - so this request is simply to upgrade these dependencies:\n\n```diff\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n-   \"postcss-modules-local-by-default\": \"4.0.0\",\n+   \"postcss-modules-local-by-default\": \"4.2.0\",\n-   \"lightningcss\": \"1.22.0\",\n+   \"lightningcss\": \"1.29.3\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:16 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\n  Available memory (MB): 65536\n  Available CPU cores: 10\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.18.2\n  npm: 10.8.2\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: 10.2.0\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.3.0-canary.12 // Latest available version is detected (15.3.0-canary.12).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 18.2.0\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
