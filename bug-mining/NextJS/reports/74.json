Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/FacundoSpira/parallel-routes-error\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nI have the following file structure:\n```\napp/\n├─ groups/\n│  ├─ [id]/\n│  │  ├─ new/\n│  │  │  ├─ page.tsx\n│  │  ├─ page.tsx\n├─ @modal/\n│  ├─ (.)groups/\n│  │  ├─ [id]/\n│  │  │  ├─ new/\n│  │  │  │  ├─ page.tsx\n│  ├─ default.tsx\n├─ page.tsx\n\n```\n\nIn both the `/` and `groups/[id]` routes I have Links to `groups/123/new`. When clicking it from the `/` page, it correctly opens the parallel route, but when clicking it from the `groups/123` page, it's redirecting to the actual page, and not the parallel route. This only happens when the route is inside a dynamic group (`[id]`). \n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nExpected: both links should open the parallel route. \n\n**Additional note:** this started happening after upgrading from the `15.6.0-canary.53` version. The reproduction example has two branches:\n- `main`: using next version 16.0.0-canary.3\n- `15.6.0-canary.53`: using 15.6.0-canary.53. Parallel routes work fine here in both cases\n\n### 16.0.0-canary.3\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbc4bb39-1129-4425-8e25-e80c1df0c435\n\n### 15.6.0-canary.53\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97e26043-cbbb-4ae8-a0ed-a465f72a5acc\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 25.0.0: Wed Sep 17 21:41:39 PDT 2025; root:xnu-12377.1.9~141/RELEASE_ARM64_T8103\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\n  Available CPU cores: 8\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.12.2\n  npm: 10.5.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: N/A\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 16.0.0-canary.3 // Latest available version is detected (16.0.0-canary.3).\n  eslint-config-next: 16.0.0-canary.3\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.9.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
