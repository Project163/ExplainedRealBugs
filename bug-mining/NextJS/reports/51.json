NOTE: when `next/font` is *not* imported in the `not-found` page [here](https://github.com/stefanprobst/issue-next-turbo-fonts/blob/main/app/not-found.tsx) it *does* work correctly with turbopack build as well.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nturbopack build should behave like webpack build/dev, and turbopack dev.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #202403151937 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Mar 15 19:52:22 UTC 2024\n  Available memory (MB): 31401\n  Available CPU cores: 16\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.14.0\n  npm: 10.9.2\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: 10.6.2\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.3.0-canary.38 // Latest available version is detected (15.3.0-canary.38).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.8.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
