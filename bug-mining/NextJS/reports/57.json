Since it’s an essential tool for inspecting component hierarchies, monitoring props and state, and debugging re-renders, it should be briefly introduced with a link to official DevTools resources.\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nReact DevTools is a widely used tool among React developers for debugging and inspecting apps. Since the Next.js framework is built on React, mentioning React DevTools in the documentation can help developers better understand and troubleshoot their components within a Next.js environment.\n\n### Does the docs page already exist? Please link to it.\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"icyJoseph","id":21013447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEzNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21013447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph","html_url":"https://github.com/icyJoseph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/82308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/82308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
