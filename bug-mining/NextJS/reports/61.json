Run `npm install && npm test`.\n2. Note the typecheck error:\n\n```\n.next/types/validator.ts:25:11 - error TS1360: Type 'typeof import(\"/Users/billy/work/nextjs-typed-routes-bug/app/route\")' does not satisfy the expected type 'RouteHandlerConfig<\"/\">'.\n  The types returned by 'GET(...)' are incompatible between these types.\n    Type 'Promise<Response | undefined>' is not assignable to type 'void | Response | Promise<Response> | Promise<void>'.\n      Type 'Promise<Response | undefined>' is not assignable to type 'Promise<Response>'.\n        Type 'Response | undefined' is not assignable to type 'Response'.\n          Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'Response'.\n\n25   handler satisfies RouteHandlerConfig<\"/\">\n```\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nThis route handler should pass typechecking:\n\n```tsx\nexport async function GET() {\n  return Math.random() > 0.5 ? new Response() : undefined\n}\n```\n\nCurrently, it doesn't because Next.js's auto-generated type validation says:\n\n```tsx\ntype RouteHandlerConfig<Route extends AppRouteHandlerRoutes = AppRouteHandlerRoutes> = {\n  GET?: (request: NextRequest, context: { params: Promise<ParamMap[Route]> }) => Promise<Response> | Response | Promise<void> | void\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is that `Promise<Response | void>` isn't assignable to `Promise<Response> | Promise<void>`.\n\nThe former should be a valid return type for route handlers. Can Next.js update its validation generator to replace `Promise<Response> | Promise<void>` with `Promise<Response | void>`?\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.6.0: Mon Jul 14 11:30:30 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.140.69~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\n  Available memory (MB): 98304\n  Available CPU cores: 12\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.18.0\n  npm: 11.5.2\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: N/A\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.5.0 // Latest available version is detected (15.5.0).\n  eslint-config-next: 15.5.0\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.9.2\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
