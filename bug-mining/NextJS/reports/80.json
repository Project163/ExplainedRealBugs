Clone the next-16 branch: `git clone -b next-16 https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat.git`\n2. Install dependencies: `bun install` (or `pnpm install`)\n3. Run production build: `bun run build`\n4. Build worker exits with prerender error\n\n\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nwith next16.0.1 ,it failed when building:\n\n```\nError occurred prerendering page \"/sitemap/pages.xml\".

The sitemap API's id parameter type has changed from string to Promise<string> without documentation or migration guide.\n\nWorkaround:\n\n  Adding await to unwrap the Promise:\n\n```\n  export default async function sitemap({ id }: { id: Promise<string> }): Promise<MetadataRoute.Sitemap> {\n    const idValue = await id; // unwrap Promise\n    const { type, page } = parsePaginatedId(idValue);\n    // ...\n  }\n```\n\nHowever, this breaks the documented API contract where id is supposed to be a string according to the\n  https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap.\n","closed_by":{"login":"icyJoseph","id":21013447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEzNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21013447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph","html_url":"https://github.com/icyJoseph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
