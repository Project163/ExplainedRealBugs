you for this investigation @marcelltoth, it saved me a ton of time! Just faced the same problem on AWS Amplify Gen 1 this morning.\n\nIn our app we use `Authenticator` from `@aws-amplify/ui-react` so we had to add more paths:\n\n```js\n  outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n    \"/*\": [\n      \"node_modules/@aws-amplify/core/dist/esm/providers/pinpoint/types/*\",\n      \"node_modules/@aws-amplify/storage/dist/esm/**/*\",\n      \"node_modules/@aws-amplify/ui-react/dist/esm/**/*\",\n    ],\n  },\n```\n\nOur Next.js app is in a monorepo workspace (which is somewhat unconventional for AWS Amplify Gen 1). Because of that, I had to add `../..` before `node_modules`. So in practice, our config looks like this:\n\n```js\n  output: \"standalone\",\n\n  // https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/85172\n  outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n    \"/*\": [\n
