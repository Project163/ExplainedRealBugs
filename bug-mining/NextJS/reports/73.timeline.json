is about whether `new URL(\"logo.png\", import.meta.url)` and `import logo from \"./logo.png\"` return a client or a server asset:\n\n- a server asset is a file that will be read by the server during rendering, for example a Wasm or font file (if you think about vercel/og image generation). It's stored on the server next to the JS chunks\n- a client asset is a file that will be used by the browser, e.g. for an `<img src={logo}/>` usecase. It will be stored on the CDN and have the `_next/` prefix.\n\nFor\n\n- client contexts, it's easy: all imports are client assets (unsurprisingly)\n- SSR contexts, we emulate the client (to prevent hydration mismatches)\n- API/metadata context, it's less clear cut what should happen, but we arbitrarily do the following: `new URL` returns server assets and `import logo` returns client assets.\n\nThat very last case of having client assets for imports, and server assets for `new URL` wasn't implemented in Turbopack.\n\nTurbopack doesn't change anything here fundamentally, but Webpack appears to have some bugs where this is less consistent (across nodejs/edge and api/metadata routes for example).
