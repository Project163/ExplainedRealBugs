Falling back to nearest NotFound boundary.`\r\nThis warning only appears in dev mode, so not a huge issue. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior would either be no warning message, since no parallel routes are being used; or a warning explaining what exactly the problem is, as it doesn't have to do with parallel routes. Maybe it's just the wording, that's off.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nNode.js v23.5.0\r\n\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: arm64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.2.0: Fri Dec  6 19:02:41 PST 2024; root:xnu-11215.61.5~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6030\r\n  Available memory (MB): 36864\r\n  Available CPU cores: 12\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 23.5.0\r\n  npm: 10.9.2\r\n  Yarn: N/A\r\n  pnpm: 9.4.0\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.22 // An outdated version detected (latest is 15.1.4), upgrade is highly recommended!\r\n  eslint-config-next: 14.2.22\r\n  react: 18.3.1\r\n  react-dom: 18.3.1\r\n  typescript: 5.7.2\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
