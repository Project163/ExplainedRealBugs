Set up a fetch function that uses a tag for caching:\n\n```\nexport const getData = async () => {\n  'use cache';\n  cacheTag('example-tag');\n  cacheLife('seconds');\n\n  return fetch('https://example.com/api/data', {\n    method: 'GET',\n  });\n};\n```\n\n2. Create an action or route handler that revalidates the tag:\n\n```\n'use server';\n\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';\n\nexport async function revalidateExampleTag() {\n  revalidateTag('example-tag');\n}\n```\n\n3. Call the revalidation action from another component:\n\n```\n// app/page.tsx or app/components/Trigger.tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { revalidateExampleTag } from '../actions';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => revalidateExampleTag()}>\n      Revalidate\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n**Current**\n\nWhen calling `revalidateTag()` in a Next.js app (App Router), any `fetch()` requests that are internally triggered as part of the revalidation are not logged in the terminal\n\n**Expected**\n\n`fetch()` requests triggered by `revalidateTag()` should be logged in the terminal like any other server-side fetch call\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\n\"next\": \"15.4.0-canary.75\",\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\ndynamicIO\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nnext dev (local)\n\n### Additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ec7eacc-f041-46a4-acf4-a884c49e7531","closed_by":{"login":"unstubbable","id":761683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable","html_url":"https://github.com/unstubbable","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/80444/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/80444/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
