After the revalidation, the full route cache should store a new number, `number2`.\r\n7. go back to `http://localhost:3000` and wait for > 25 seconds. The reason we should wait for 25 seconds is because the client-side router cache is fresh for another 25 seconds\r\n8. hover over the random number button, and another prefetch request should be sent (because the client-side router cache is stale), giving back the number `number2` that is stored in\r\n   the full route cache. However that is not what happens. You will still see `number1`, because the prefetch request is never sent. No matter how long you wait, the prefetch request is never sent.\r\n9. In order to see `number2`, you have to manually refresh the page.\r\n\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrent: the client side router cache only expires for the first time, then it becomes fresh forever.\r\nExpected: the client side cache should expire every > 25 seconds, if the page is visited.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 22.6.0: Thu Sep  5 20:48:48 PDT 2024; root:xnu-8796.141.3.708.1~1/RELEASE_X86_64\r\n  Available memory (MB): 8192\r\n  Available CPU cores: 4\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.15.0\r\n  npm: 10.9.0\r\n  Yarn: N/A\r\n  pnpm: 9.12.3\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 15.1.1-canary.17 // There is a newer canary version (15.1.1-canary.18) available, please upgrade! \r\n  eslint-config-next: 13.5.1\r\n  react: 19.0.0\r\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\r\n  typescript: 5.2.2\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
