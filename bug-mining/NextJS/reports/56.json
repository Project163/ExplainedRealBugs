Start the application in development `node --run dev`\n2. Open the test page `http://localhost:3000/en-GB`\n3. Click on the button to execute the Server Action\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n# Current behavior\n\nClicking on the button executes the server action and sets the cookie, however it immediately throws an error with the following message:\n\n<img width=\"1021\" height=\"579\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3288e078-cb3a-4171-89ea-38020d400607\" />\n\n# Expected\n\nThe server action should execute and the page should be revalidated without issue.\n\n# Notes\n\nNotice that the code in `actions.ts` DOES NOT access `next/root-params` at all.\n\nThe problem occurs due to the following two rules/behaviors:\n\n- `next/root-params` are not supposed to be imported/used in server actions because actions are not tied to a specific route.\n- Mutating cookies in a server action, causes a full page/layout re-render. This happens to avoid stale RSC state.\n\nSo as far as I can tell, what happens is the code that tracks root-params access inside server actions incorrectly considers the route revalidation+rendering as part of the action execution.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.5.0: Tue Apr 22 19:54:25 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.121.6~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\n  Available memory (MB): 32768\n  Available CPU cores: 12\nBinaries:\n  Node: 24.5.0\n  npm: 11.5.2\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: 9.15.9\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.2-canary.27 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.2-canary.27).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.1\n  react-dom: 19.1.1\n  typescript: N/A\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
