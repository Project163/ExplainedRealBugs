not sure I follow. Next.js has [two server runtimes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes) for applications, right? The Edge Runtime is just the default (and until recently the only) option for Middleware.\n\nWe deploy our app to edge network where Node.js and Node.js APIs are not available. This is why we use Edge Runtime not only for the Middleware but for the whole app.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/2725726283/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"miktirr","id":6806359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDYzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6806359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr","html_url":"https://github.com/miktirr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miktirr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/2725767700","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/76930#issuecomment-2725767700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/76930","id":2725767700,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis6id-oU","user":{"login":"samcx","id":28912696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTEyNjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28912696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx","html_url":"https://github.com/samcx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-14T21:06:32Z","updated_at":"2025-03-14T21:06:32Z","body":">

#76930\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nFixes an issue where using a Webpack plugin that creates child compilers in a Next.js project could result in asset emission conflicts.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nStarting from [vercel/next.js#75927](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/75927), Next.js uses compilation.emitAsset to emit assets. However, emitAsset throws an error when attempting to emit an asset with the same name and identical content more than once.\r\nThis behavior is defined in Webpack's implementation:\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/70e3d9d5dbd3548431b8878dead4647beff5c14f/lib/Compilation.js#L4615-L4628\r\n\r\nWhen a plugin hooks into the compilation phase, it also runs for child compilers. This can lead to duplicated asset emission when using plugins that spawn child compilers, such as [vanilla-extract](https://github.com/vanilla-extract-css/vanilla-extract/blob/c66be53d600802b2922da1d6034e2a5ff3fbbcae/packages/webpack-plugin/src/compiler.ts#L85-L89).\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, we now use the thisCompilation hook instead of compilation, which ensures that the plugin only applies to the main compilation and not to any child compilers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/78011/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/78011/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/2797396896","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/76930#issuecomment-2797396896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/76930","id":2797396896,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis6mvOOg","user":{"login":"Karibash","id":40270352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjcwMzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40270352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash","html_url":"https://github.com/Karibash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Karibash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-11T16:23:20Z","updated_at":"2025-04-11T16:23:20Z","body":"Hi @samcx,\nThis issue is not related to whether EdgeRuntime is used or not.\nThe root cause is a change made to the Webpack plugin in the following PR:\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/75927\nI’ve created a PR to fix the issue.
