If locale: false is used you must prefix the source and destination with a locale for it to be matched correctly.\n\n```tsx\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en', 'fr', 'de'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n \n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n...\n```\n\nThe page `internationalization`, which is linked in the first sentence, doesn't actually mention putting anything into `i18n` section of the config, so it's not clear how this section is relevant or when it will work.\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nIt seems that this has copied from `pages` exactly, but is no longer applicable.\n\n### Does the docs page already exist?
