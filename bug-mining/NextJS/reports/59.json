Clone https://github.com/tnunamak/turbopack-openpgp-repro\n2. `npm install`\n3. `npm run dev`\n4. Visit http://localhost:3000/api/test - Works\n5. `npm run dev:turbo`\n6. Visit http://localhost:3000/api/test - Fails\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nStatic imports of OpenPGP.js fail with Turbopack but work with webpack.\n\n```\n  ReferenceError: Cannot access 'globalThis' before initialization\n      at [project]/app/api/test/route.ts [app-route] (ecmascript) (app/api/test/route.ts:2:0)\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n  Static imports should work with Turbopack as they do with webpack, since:\n  - OpenPGP.js docs show static imports as the standard usage\n  - `globalThis` is a standard ES2020 feature\n  - Works in Node.js, webpack, and other bundlers\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #27-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Jul 22 17:01:58 UTC 2025\n  Available memory (MB): 127934\n  Available CPU cores: 24\nBinaries:\n  Node: 24.3.0\n  npm: 11.4.2\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: 10.13.1\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.6 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.6).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.1\n  react-dom: 19.1.1\n  typescript: 5.9.2\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
