Improve IPC socket handling in Turbopack Node.js communication\n\n### What?\nEnhances the IPC communication between Turbopack and Node.js processes by implementing proper socket backpressure handling.\n\n### Why?\nThe current implementation doesn't properly handle backpressure when writing to sockets, which can lead to hanging where Node.js doesn't write the rest of the data.\n\n### How?\n- Added a `Writable` stream wrapper around the socket to properly handle backpressure\n- Implemented drain event handling to ensure data is written correctly\n- Enabled noDelay on both the Node.js client and Rust server sides\n- Moved stringify into the promise to make the stringify + write happen in the same tick.\n\nPart of PACK-4409\n\nFixes #78407\n\nCloses

 @hrhthegreat, thanks for the great report with reproduction, huge help!\nWe've investigated and fixed the root cause of the hanging in this PR:\n\n- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/78462 (landing soon)\n\nAnd while looking at this found that even with it not hanging it was taking quite long to process (unexpectedly long). We've made an improvement to that here:\n\n- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/78522 (landed)\n\nIt's still a bit slower than webpack on the amount of files Tailwind reports, we're going to investigate that further and fix it, but wanted to give you an update.\nThanks
