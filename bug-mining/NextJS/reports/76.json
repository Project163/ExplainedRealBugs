Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/luishdz1010/next-bug-turbo-parallel-routes\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Clone this reproduction repo:\n\n```bash\nnpx degit luishdz1010/next-bug-turbo-parallel-routes next-bug-turbo-parallel-routes\ncd next-bug-turbo-parallel-routes\npnpm install\n```\n\n2. Run `pnpm build`.\n\n3. Observe the failure while collecting page data for `/[tenant]/c` with the referenced stack trace.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n`next build` fails under Turbopack when a layout for `app/[tenant]/[[...pages]]` exports `generateStaticParams` while the same route tree also defines a parallel route slot (`@nav/c`). During static path generation Turbopack attempts to destructure the param descriptor for `pages` from the regex associated with `/[tenant]/c`, but that route does not declare the optional catch-all param, leading to:\n\n```\nTypeError: Cannot destructure property 'repeat' of 'regex.groups[paramName]' as it is undefined.\n    at ignore-listed frames\n\n> Build error occurred\nError: Failed to collect page data for /[tenant]/c\n```\nWorks fine with `--webpack`, also works fine with Turbo's dev mode.\n\n### Expected\n`next build` should succeed with Turbopack. Routes that do not define a `pages` param should not receive static params generated for sibling branches.\n\n\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #202508231538~1757385336~22.04~8f363f2 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue S\n  Available memory (MB): 94177\n  Available CPU cores: 32\nBinaries:\n  Node: 24.9.0\n  npm: 11.6.0\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: 9.15.4\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.6.0-canary.42 // Latest available version is detected (15.6.0-canary.42).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.2.0\n  react-dom: 19.2.0\n  typescript: 5.9.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
