is a bug with how the closure is captured to be re-used when the action is called. If you add `allData`, and `user` to the `console.log` you do, then it'll work:\n\n```ts\n          console.log({\n            formData,\n            myData,\n            name,\n            email,\n            redirUrl,\n            // add these two\n            allData,\n            user,\n          });\n``` \n\n- https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-9olvaijx?file=src%2Fapp%2Fbug%2Fpage.tsx\n\nThe team has already prepared a PR to fix the issue.\n\nThough, the workaround you have posted, is the right way to go:\n\n 1. filter the list based on user knowledge during SSR time\n 1. the payload sent when submitting the Server Functions contains only the current user's data\n \nAnd, even though, the closure data is encrypted, it is good practice to not include unnecessary data client side, even more, if this is potentially sensitive data.\n\nIn general, be defensive when passing data from Server to Client boundaries. Include only things that are absolutely necessary.\n\n- https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/taint\n-
