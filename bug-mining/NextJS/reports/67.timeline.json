Improve BytePos encoding for large source maps\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the BytePos encoding mechanism in scope-hoisted modules to handle larger source maps. The previous implementation had limitations when dealing with large byte positions, which could cause errors during source map generation.\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n\r\n- Added a lookup table to store byte positions and module indexes that are too large for the standard encoding\r\n- Implemented a continuation flag (using the highest bit) to indicate when a position is stored in the lookup table\r\n- Added a sign extension flag to properly handle padded values\r\n- Updated all relevant code paths to use the new encoding/decoding mechanism\r\n- Adjusted the header width calculation to accommodate the new flags\r\n- Made the encoding/decoding functions thread-safe with Arc<Mutex<>>\r\n\r\nThis approach allows us to handle arbitrarily large byte positions while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing encoding scheme for smaller values to ensure performance stays as optimal as possible.\r\n\r\nFixes PACK-5244\r\nFixes
