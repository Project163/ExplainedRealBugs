There is a loading.tsx boundary around most of the pages. Each dynamic page is configured to `await connection()` then sleep for a second to mimic a dynamic network request. In addition, there is one extra dynamic page which has no loading boundary, but instead implements it itself using `Suspense`.\n \n1. Deploy the application to Vercel (`pnpm vercel deploy`)\n1. Visit the application e.g. https://vercel-rdc-deep-dive-ql5p89xy5-rikinsearchofas-projects.vercel.app/en/static-page\n1. Click on `link (prefetch=true) to dynamic-page-1`: observe that the children UI hangs on \"Page Loading...\" \n1. Hard-refresh: observe that the children UI resolves after 1s to \"Dynamic Page 1 Loaded\"\n1. Click on the `prefetch=auto` or `prefetch=false` links and observe their associated pages load correctly after 1 second, or the static page link which loads instantly.\n1. Click on the `dynamic-with-suspense` link, which is also full prefetched, and observe that the page loads and hangs at the Suspense boundary (in fallback) - the same effect but proving not just a loading.tsx issue.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nAs described above, it seems like `Suspense` boundaries often hang indefinitely when deployed on Vercel when they act as the boundary for a dynamic segment. This occurs only when `prefetch={true}`: it does not occur with auto or no prefetching. \n\n### Provide environment information\n\nThis is my local environment, but it **does not** reproduce on `next start`. I can only reproduce this in Vercel (nb: have not tried any other cloud providers).\n\nUpdate 10/22: can confirm this is an issue on the just-released Next 16 stable\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 25.0.0: Wed Sep 17 21:41:26 PDT 2025; root:xnu-12377.1.9~141/RELEASE_ARM64_T6041\n  Available memory (MB): 131072\n  Available CPU cores: 16\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.18.0\n  npm: 10.9.3\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: 10.18.3\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 16.0.0-canary.16 // Latest available version is detected (16.0.0-canary.16).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.2.0\n  react-dom: 19.2.0\n  typescript: 5.9.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

However, if I go back to canary.5 - it does not occur if rdcForNavigations is false, but does occur if I turn on the experimental flag. \n\nI have not tried patching Next.js to turn rdcForNavigations off again, but it crossed my mind 🙃 \n\nThe current code in the repo is deployed to https://vercel-rdc-deep-dive-cma0huu9z-rikinsearchofas-projects.vercel.app/en/static-page .","closed_by":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85162/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
