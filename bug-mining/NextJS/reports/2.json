Click \"Redirect\" button on \"/\" page\r\n\r\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\r\n\r\n**Current Behavior**\r\nForm submission runs server action which should execute redirect('/dashboard').  I get a 303 for the redirect, but the redirect is not performed in the browser.  Server action completes and nothing happens.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nForm submission runs server action which executes successful redirect to '/dashboard'\r\n\r\n### Provide environment information\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: win32\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: Windows 11 Pro\r\n  Available memory (MB): 16075\r\n  Available CPU cores: 8\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 22.11.0\r\n  npm: 10.8.3\r\n  Yarn: N/A\r\n  pnpm: N/A\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 15.0.3 // Latest available version is detected (15.0.3).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 19.0.0-rc-66855b96-20241106\r\n  react-dom: 19.0.0-rc-66855b96-20241106\r\n  typescript: N/A\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which area(s) are affected?

(Select all that apply)\r\n\r\nnext dev (local)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThis is the exact project structure and route grouping I used in all of my Next 14 builds.  I have the (auth) group and page, which should redirect users via server action to the /dashboard page with successful login.  After migrating to Next 15 along with next/form Form and useActionState, redirect does not properly execute.  The minimal recreation repo I provided should demonstrate the issue clearly.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!","closed_by":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/72842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/72842/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
