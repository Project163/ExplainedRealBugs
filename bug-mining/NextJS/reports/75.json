Clone the repo, install deps\n2. `pnpm dev` → view the generated CSS file for Webpack behaviour (correct)\n3. `pnpm dev --turbopack` → view the generated CSS file for Turbopack behaviour (incorrect)\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nWe have\n\n```ts\nimport localFont from \"next/font/local\";\n\nconst font = localFont({\n  src: [{ path: \"./regular.woff2\", weight: \"normal\", style: \"normal\" }],\n  display: \"swap\",\n  declarations: [{ prop: \"size-adjust\", value: \"90%\" }],\n  adjustFontFallback: false,\n});\n```\n\nRunning the app with Webpack, the `{ prop: \"size-adjust\", value: \"90%\" }` works:\n\n```css\n/* pnpm dev */\n@font-face {\n    size-adjust: 90%;\n    font-family: 'font';\n    src: url(/_next/static/media/bf09337bba4146da.p.woff2) format('woff2');\n    font-display: swap;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    font-style: normal;\n}\n```\n\nRunning the app with Turbopack, the declaration no longer works:\n\n```css\n/* pnpm dev --turbopack */\n@font-face {\n  font-family: font;\n  src: url(\"../media/regular.p.eeec7ef5.woff2\") format(\"woff2\");\n  font-display: swap;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  font-style: normal;\n}\n```\n\n**Expected behaviour:** `localFont`'s `declarations` should work with Turbopack.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #35~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon May 26 18:08:30 UTC 2025\n  Available memory (MB): 7945\n  Available CPU cores: 2\nBinaries:\n  Node: 18.20.8\n  npm: 10.8.2\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: 10.11.0\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.5.0 // Latest available version is detected (15.5.0).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.1\n  react-dom: 19.1.1\n  typescript: 5.9.2\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
