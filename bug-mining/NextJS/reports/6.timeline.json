TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Preferred way to test this one? I feel like I need a suggestion from core maintainers\r\n- [ ] Explore a better way to ensure unique pages/segments\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n92b3dd2 Introduced some changes that, accidentally cause the number of `parentsParams`, to grow exponentially. \r\n\r\nWhen `generateStaticParams`, returns about 29 elements, the build barely passes. Adding one more, causes JS to crash Out of Memory.  \r\n\r\nWith 39 elements returned from `generateStaticParams`, you can see quickly, `parentParams` cross up to millions of elements. I've dumped more info into #73793\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nHaving a build ran out of memory because `generateStaticParams` return 30 elements, is not acceptable. In certain applications, these functions return several more elements.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the segments, keep adding the same segment, three times over, once per parallel route, if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1132\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 23 40 04\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e42bf898-d5e3-475c-b423-9976113c5f2a\" />\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> See how the `[slug]/layout.tsx` bit is added twice (in the screenshot)\r\n> You can long this info at `packages/next/src/build/utils.ts`,  within the `buildAppStaticPaths` function, at the `builtRouteParams` callback, by logging `parentsParams` within the callback scope.\r\n\r\nBy doing this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    if (name === PAGE_SEGMENT_KEY) {\r\n      currentSegments.forEach((seg) => {\r\n        if (\r\n          segments.some(\r\n            (other) =>\r\n              other.name === seg.name &&\r\n              other.filePath === seg.filePath &&\r\n              other.param === seg.param\r\n          )\r\n        ) {\r\n          return\r\n        }\r\n        segments.push(seg)\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a means to ensure uniqueness of the segments. Of course this is a `\"poor\"` mans solution, but it seems to work well so far. Ideally, we should have  a cache, or set, to quickly check if a segment as already been added.\r\n\r\nFixes #73793\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/73871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/73871/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/2541015257","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/73793#issuecomment-2541015257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/73793","id":2541015257,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis6XdNDZ","user":{"login":"pchab","id":1932473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzI0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1932473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab","html_url":"https://github.com/pchab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-13T09:47:32Z","updated_at":"2024-12-13T09:47:32Z","body":"@icyJoseph Thanks a lot for your investigation so far.

refactors `collectAppPageSegments` to be more efficient especially when dealing with multiple parallel routes, where the number of combinations of segments can drastically increase how many segments are returned per route. Previously this function only considered the `children` parallel route. When it was updated to consider all possible parallel routes in #73358, this had the unintended side effect of increasing the amount of duplicate segments this function would have to process. \r\n\r\nWe only need to return unique segments discovered from a particular loader tree (representing a page), as opposed to the same segment as many times as it might appear across all parallel routes. This PR uses a map to track unique segments with a composite key used to identify the discovered segments. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this refactors the function to be iterative rather than recursive. We keep track of a queue of segments to be processed (a tuple of `[loaderTree, segments]`), and as we discover new parallel route paths, we process the queue further.\r\n\r\nFixes #73793\r\nCloses
