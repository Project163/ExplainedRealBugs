Not yet supported in Turbopack\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### SWC plugin transforms working properly with Turbopack*\n\nStatus: ✅ works, ✅ integrated\n\nUnlike in webpack, SWC plugins in Turbopack didn't receive the full paths, which made our hashing of class names unstable. @kdy1 fixed it and it was integrated in `next-yak` here: https://github.com/DigitecGalaxus/next-yak/pull/334\n\nTracked issues:\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/78156\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/78181\n\n### CSS (Modules) import support\n\nStatus: ✅ works, 🚧 not yet integrated\n\nIn order to be able to import the generated CSS as a virtual CSS-Module, we use an [inline matchResource](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#inline-matchresource) of webpack. This API doesn't exist in turbopack and Tobias pointed to a possible solution with [data: URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data). This was recently implemented in turbopack and we've created a proof of concept where we transform it to data urls, which seems to work.\n\nStill open is the full integration into `next-yak` and to find a good way to tell if we're transpiling for webpack or turbopack.\n\nTracked issues:\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/74825\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/78040\nhttps://github.com/DigitecGalaxus/next-yak/issues/315\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/78096\n\n### Cross-file CSS resolution through the dependency graph\n\nStatus: 🚧 figuring out a solution\n\nTo resolve cross-file CSS selectors & mixins, we currently use [this.loadModule](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#thisloadmodule), which doesn't exist in turbopack (yet?)\n\nTracked issues:\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/78693\n\n### Build-time evaluation of yak files with constant replacement\n\nStatus: 🚧 figuring out a solution\n\nIn order to use build time values, we use [this.importModule](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#thisimportmodule), which is currently not available on turbopack (yet?)\n\n## Testing & Validation\n\n- [ ] Create test suite for Turbopack integration\n- [ ] Verify hot reloading works correctly\n- [ ] Performance comparison between webpack and Turbopack implementations\n\n## Contributing\nIf you have experience with Turbopack or want to help with this implementation, please comment below with your ideas or proposed solutions.\n\n## Stay Updated\nIf you want to stay informed about our progress and Vercel's ongoing work to support Turbopack for next-yak, please subscribe to this issue. We'll post updates as development progresses.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DigitecGalaxus/next-yak/issues/336/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DigitecGalaxus/next-yak/issues/336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/2881861870","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/78181#issuecomment-2881861870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/78181","id":2881861870,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis6rxbju","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-15T00:05:34Z","updated_at":"2025-05-15T00:05:34Z","body":"This closed issue has been automatically locked because it had no new activity for 2 weeks.
