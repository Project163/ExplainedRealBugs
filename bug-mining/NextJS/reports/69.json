Using that, the same import could look like:\n`import { i18n, type Locale } from \"@/i18n-config\";`\n\n\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\n**Proposal**\n- Update the examples to use the `@/` alias (which points to the src or project root) instead of deeply nested relative imports\n- Add `\n\"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./*\"]\n    }\n` to `tsconfig.json` / `jsconfig.json` to each example \n\n**Why**\n- Improves readability.\n- Reduces risk of mistakes when reorganizing folders.\n- Aligns with how many production-grade Next.js apps are set up.\n\n**Question**\nIs Vercel or Nextjs open to a PR introducing `@/` imports to the examples?\n\n### Does the docs page already exist? Please link to it.\n\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/i18n-routing/app/[lang]/components/locale-switcher.tsx","closed_by":{"login":"icyJoseph","id":21013447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEzNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21013447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph","html_url":"https://github.com/icyJoseph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/83717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/83717/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
