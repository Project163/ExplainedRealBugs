What?\n\nAdds depth-aware parameter resolution to `resolveParallelRouteParams` by migrating from simplified parallel route segments to LoaderTree structure.\n\n### Why?\n\nDynamic and intercepted parameters in parallel routes were not being correctly extracted when used at nested depths. The previous implementation didn't account for:\n- Route nesting level when matching pathname segments to parameters\n- Route groups (which don't affect depth) vs interception routes (which do)\n- Embedded parameters that need resolution before depth calculation\n\nThis caused incorrect behavior in real-world scenarios like:\n- Nested parallel routes at different depths\n- Interception routes with parallel routes\n- ISR/generateStaticParams with complex routing structures\n\n### How?\n\n1. **LoaderTree Integration**: Migrated from `ParallelRouteSegment[]` to LoaderTree structure for accurate routing hierarchy representation\n2. **Depth Tracking**: Recursively traverse LoaderTree to calculate depth, accounting for:\n   - Static segments (increment depth)\n   - Dynamic segments (increment depth)\n   - Route groups `()` - don't increment depth\n   - Interception routes `(.)` `(..)` `(...)` - do increment depth\n3. **Smart Parameter Extraction**: \n   - Check if pathname segment at calculated depth is a placeholder\n   - Only extract if segment is known (not `[paramName]`)\n   - Resolve embedded params before extraction\n4. **Comprehensive Tests**: Added test coverage for:\n   - Dynamic params at various depths\n   - Route groups vs interception routes\n   - Catchall/optional-catchall with depth\n   - Complex nested scenarios\n\nFixes #85251","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85319/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20492715695,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBC3Cis7TLoBCzwAAAATFdgav","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/20492715695","actor":{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh","html_url":"https://github.com/wyattjoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3cf4b17ba8c4305974fc122bea839f901f8f478f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/commits/3cf4b17ba8c4305974fc122bea839f901f8f478f","created_at":"2025-10-24T20:07:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20492715728,"node_id":"CE_lADOBC3Cis7TLoBCzwAAAATFdgbQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/20492715728","actor":{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh","html_url":"https://github.com/wyattjoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-24T20:07:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/3505434708","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/85251#issuecomment-3505434708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85251","id":3505434708,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis7Q8LBU","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-11-08T00:05:48Z","updated_at":"2025-11-08T00:05:48Z","body":"This closed issue has been automatically locked because it had no new activity for 2 weeks.
