Visit `http://localhost:3000/head`\n3. Inspect `<head>` and see duplicate meta tags.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nI expect it to work like on `15.3.x`. Without duplicate meta tags in `<head>`.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #63-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Apr 15 19:04:15 UTC 2025\n  Available memory (MB): 14800\n  Available CPU cores: 16\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.18.0\n  npm: 11.4.1\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: 9.6.0\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.2-canary.0 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.2-canary.0).\n  eslint-config-next: 15.4.1\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.8.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

Somewhere in the render process the head tags get duplicated.","closed_by":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81655/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
