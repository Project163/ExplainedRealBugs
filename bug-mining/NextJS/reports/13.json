Start the application in development\n2. Observe that the called server action, rather than returning its input as-is, intersperses many � characters in its output.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nI expect the server action to receive the UTF-8 text intact, but it becomes mangled.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.2.0: Tue Oct 15 18:17:45 PDT 2024; root:xnu-11215.60.364.501.5~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6030\n  Available memory (MB): 18432\n  Available CPU cores: 11\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.15.0\n  npm: 10.7.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: N/A\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.2.0-canary.8 // Latest available version is detected (15.2.0-canary.8).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.0.0\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\n  typescript: 5.7.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nRuntime\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nOther (Deployed), next start (local), next build (local), next dev (local)\n\n### Additional context\n\nI've traced the bug down to [this portion of action-handler.ts](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v15.2.0-canary.8/packages/next/src/server/app-render/action-handler.ts#L715):\n\n```js\nconst reader = req.body.getReader()\nwhile (true) {\n  const { done, value } = await reader.read()\n  if (done) {\n    break\n  }\n\n  actionData += new TextDecoder().decode(value)\n}\n```\n\n`TextDecoder` is incorrectly used to decode each chunk, rather than decode all chunks concatenated.\n\nThis only affects the edge runtime, because the text decoding is done properly in the non-edge-runtime branch of this function.\n\n```js\nconst chunks: Buffer[] = []\nfor await (const chunk of req.body) {\n  chunks.push(Buffer.from(chunk))\n}\n\nconst actionData = Buffer.concat(chunks).toString('utf-8')\n```\n\nI'm not sure if \"Runtime\" is the best category for this bug, please go ahead and change if this is not accurate. I will submit a PR to fix this issue soon.","closed_by":{"login":"unstubbable","id":761683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable","html_url":"https://github.com/unstubbable","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/74843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/74843/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
