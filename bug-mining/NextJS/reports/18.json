Clone https://github.com/DiPSoMaNiE/next-canary-prisma-issue\n2. Run `bun install`\n3. Run `prisma generate`\n4. Run `bun dev`\n5. Go to `http://localhost:3000` and see error\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nThis error occurs when:\n- using `next@15.2.0-canary.40` or above (works on `15.2.0-canary.39` and below)\n- using `next dev --turbopack` (works with `next dev` or `next build` which use webpack)\n- using custom output path in the `generator` block of `schema.prisma`\n\nTo make it work:\n\n1. Comment the `output   = \"../generated\"` line in `prisma/schema.prisma`\n2. Run `prisma generate`\n3. Change `import { PrismaClient } from '../generated'` to `import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'` in `src/db.ts`\n4. Run `bun dev`\n5. Go to `http://localhost:3000` and see it works\n\nEverything should work as expected with a custom output path for the generated `PrismaClient`.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:22 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6041\n  Available memory (MB): 49152\n  Available CPU cores: 12\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.14.0\n  npm: 10.9.2\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: N/A\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.2.0-canary.74 // Latest available version is detected (15.2.0-canary.74).\n  eslint-config-next: 15.2.0-canary.74\n  react: 19.0.0\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\n  typescript: 5.7.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
