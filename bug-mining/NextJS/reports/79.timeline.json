#85474 \r\n\r\nPreviously, the analyzer treated all assignment expressions the same way, evaluating them as their right-hand side value. This was incorrect for compound assignments (+=, -=, *=, |=, >>=, etc.), which compute a new value based on both the left and right operands.\r\n\r\nThis commit distinguishes between simple assignments (=) and compound assignments. Simple assignments continue to evaluate to the right-hand side, while compound assignments are now properly marked as unknown values with side effects.\r\n\r\nAlso adds tests for compound assignments in conditionals, covering bitshift operations (>>=, <<=, >>>=) and bitwise operations (|=, &=, ^=) with both numbers and bigints.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

https://vercel.slack.com/archives/C04KC8A53T7/p1761862171772939 \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nfixes #85474 \r\n\r\nPreviously, the analyzer treated all assignment expressions the same way, evaluating them as their right-hand side value. This was incorrect for compound assignments (+=, -=, *=, |=, >>=, etc.), which compute a new value based on both the left and right operands.\r\n\r\nThis commit distinguishes between simple assignments (=) and compound assignments. Simple assignments continue to evaluate to the right-hand side, while compound assignments are now properly marked as unknown values with side effects.\r\n\r\nAlso adds tests for compound assignments in conditionals, covering bitshift operations (>>=, <<=, >>>=) and bitwise operations (|=, &=, ^=) with both numbers and bigints.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85593/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20634388697,"node_id":"CE_lADOBC3Cis7UW7EFzwAAAATN58jZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/20634388697","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-31T13:30:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20634388867,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBC3Cis7UW7EFzwAAAATN58mD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/20634388867","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"40102ab5ad345ca17290c161ccbe89dc8b7e1495","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/commits/40102ab5ad345ca17290c161ccbe89dc8b7e1495","created_at":"2025-10-31T13:30:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
