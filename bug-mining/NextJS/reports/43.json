Start the application in development (next dev).\n2. Click the on-screen indicator in the bottom left.\n3. Click \"Preferences.\"\n4. Be in system dark mode or select dark mode as your theme.\n5. Click any selection.\n\nNote: I tested on Chrome and Edge.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n## Current: \nWhen the Dark theme is active, each `<option>` in the native `<select>` still uses the browser’s white popup with white text. As a result, you cannot read which option is highlighted or selected.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8eb726ba-1fcd-4be4-9b0c-b65401c186bd)\n\n## Expected: \nIn dark mode, every `<option>` should render with a dark background and light text. Or, perhaps darker text when highlighted, like the vercel.com website? Though that might end up being too much styling to replicate; perhaps dev mode should intrinsically be much more minimal in its styling.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e488bcb8-6a0f-41c0-be8d-a839e86869bb)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e1fa005-3a6e-4dd5-839b-ff10c38b1ccf)\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: win32\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: Windows 11 Home\n  Available memory (MB): 16044\n  Available CPU cores: 16\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.16.0\n  npm: 10.8.1\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\n  pnpm: 10.11.0\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.3.3 // Latest available version is detected (15.3.3).\n  eslint-config-next: 15.3.3\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.8.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
