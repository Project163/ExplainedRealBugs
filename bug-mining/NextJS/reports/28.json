Go to the [test page](https://nextjs-dynamic-beta.vercel.app/folder/page)\n2. The page shows params that were passed, and they are different from the expected:\n\n<image src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50ff1ebf-b650-4023-87b6-4d783db574a2\" width=\"500\"/>\n\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nThe page should receive correct params:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"locale\": \"en\",\n  \"rest\": [\n    \"folder\",\n    \"page\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nBut instead receives incorrect params:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"locale\": \"folder\",\n  \"rest\": [\n    \"page\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:16 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\n  Available CPU cores: 10\nBinaries:\n  Node: 18.20.2\n  npm: 10.5.0\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: 9.15.4\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.3.0-canary.31 // Latest available version is detected (15.3.0-canary.31).\n  eslint-config-next: 15.2.4\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.8.2\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nDynamic Routes\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nVercel (Deployed)\n\n### Additional context\n\nUnder certain conditions, for a page with dynamic route an incorrect params are passed to the page\n\nThe error is reproducing for me when the following conditions are met:\n\n- the page in question has a dynamic route\n- the parent route of the dynamic route has PPR (Partial Prerendering) enabled\n- a middleware is used to rewrite an original URL to patch a route (prepend a locale in my case)\n- the project is deployed on Vercel\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Note 1: The issue is not reproducible locally.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Note 2: The parameters are passed correctly when navigating to the page from another route. The issue reproduces only when the page is loaded directly, or by refreshing the page.\n","closed_by":{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh","html_url":"https://github.com/wyattjoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/77789/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/77789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
