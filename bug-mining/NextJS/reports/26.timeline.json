also came across this issue. \nLooks like turbopack doesn't know how to handle js block statements (tss-react uses block statements, both anonymous and labeled). There's some problem with imports not existing in the closure scope in that case. \n\nWhat I tried that worked:\n- Assigning `assert` to a cost at the top of the file and using that instead of the import (although it fails at a different point later, didn't investigate that far down). \n- Replacing the block statements with IIFEs.
