Install `next@15.5.0` or newer for [the `typedRoutes` feature](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-5#typed-routes-stable)\n2. Create one `GET` [Route Handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/route-handlers-and-middleware#route-handlers) with a simple path, and one with a Dynamic Segment such as [a Catch-all Segment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments)\n3. Link to that Route Handler using [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link)\n4. The problems below is reported for the `href` props 💥\n\n```bash\n➜  workspace git:(main) ✗ pnpm tsc\napp/page.tsx:8:13 - error TS2322: Type '\"/x\"' is not assignable to type 'UrlObject | RouteImpl<\"/x\">'.\n\n8       <Link href=\"/x\">/x</Link>\n              ~~~~\n\n  .next/types/link.d.ts:79:5\n    79     href: __next_route_internal_types__.RouteImpl<RouteInferType> | UrlObject\n           ~~~~\n    The expected type comes from property 'href' which is declared here on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & LinkRestProps & { href: UrlObject | RouteImpl<\"/x\">; }'\n\napp/page.tsx:9:13 - error TS2322: Type '\"/y/a/b\"' is not assignable to type 'UrlObject | RouteImpl<\"/y/a/b\">'.\n\n9       <Link href=\"/y/a/b\">/y/a/b</Link>\n              ~~~~\n\n  .next/types/link.d.ts:79:5\n    79     href: __next_route_internal_types__.RouteImpl<RouteInferType> | UrlObject\n           ~~~~\n    The expected type comes from property 'href' which is declared here on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & LinkRestProps & { href: UrlObject | RouteImpl<\"/y/a/b\">; }'\n\n\nFound 2 errors in the same file, starting at: app/page.tsx:8\n```\n\n<img width=\"2878\" height=\"1704\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47f0cb8b-5938-4049-a7c7-84448308a3f0\" />\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrent:\n\n`typedRoutes` reports problems with links to `app/x/route.ts` and `app/y/[...ySlugs]/route.ts`\n\nThe previous implementation in `experimental.typedRoutes` did not report these problems\n\nExpected:\n\n`typedRoutes` reports no problems\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun Aug  6 20:05:33 UTC 2023\n  Available memory (MB): 8198\n  Available CPU cores: 4\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.9.0\n  npm: 9.8.1\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\n  pnpm: 8.10.2\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.5.0 // Latest available version is detected (15.5.0).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.1\n  react-dom: 19.1.1\n  typescript: 5.3.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
