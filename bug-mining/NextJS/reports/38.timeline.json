navigating to a static page that was previously prefetched, the client router should discard a stale prefetch entry, and fetch the page again, if the stale time has passed.\r\n\r\nThe selected stale time is either the default value of 5 minutes, a custom value set via `experimental.staleTimes.static`, or a stale value set via a `cacheLife` profile when using `\"use cache\"`.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes an issue where the client router interpreted the stale time value as milliseconds, whereas the server sends it in seconds.
