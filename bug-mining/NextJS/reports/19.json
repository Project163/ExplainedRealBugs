Clone the GitHub repository\n2. Run `npm run bugcheck` command in your terminal\n3. Visit `http://localhost:3000`\n\n\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrent behavior:\n\nThe links rightly point to `/link?productid=1` / `/link?productid=2` ... and so on. However, when you click on it, they redirect you to the wrong page!\n\nExpected behavior:\n\nRedirect works properly\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.1.0: Thu Oct 10 21:03:15 PDT 2024; root:xnu-11215.41.3~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\n  Available CPU cores: 8\nBinaries:\n  Node: 18.20.4\n  npm: 8.19.2\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\n  pnpm: 8.7.6\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.1.3 // There is a newer version (15.1.6) available, upgrade recommended! \n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.0.0\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\n  typescript: 5.7.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: export\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nNavigation\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nOther (Deployed), Vercel (Deployed), next start (local)\n\n### Additional context\n\nI spent 20 minutes debugging this for one of our clients today and finally figured out this is a bug with Next.js itself. The reproduction code above is extremely minimal and does not include anything else other than the required code.\n\nThe behavior is very weird, the link shown is correct in the browser preview on the bottom left but the moment it is clicked, it takes you to the wrong page. I am also attaching the video that showcases it:\n\n- In the first half of the video I show you wrong behavior\n- In the second half of the video I disable javascript and show you how it should actually work\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d64a0fe2-57bf-4d5d-b081-faa5220b7cee","closed_by":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/75318/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/75318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
