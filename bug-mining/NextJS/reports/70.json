The middleware page is confident that the file must be called \"middleware.js\" or \"middleware.ts\", and that's not always correct.\n\nPlease copy the pageExtensions warning on the instrumentation documentation to the middleware documentation.\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nNext finds pages based on specific naming that's calculated from the `pageExtensions`.  This includes various utility \"pages\", like middleware and instrumentation.  The default extensions list includes \"ts\" and \"js\", which means it would find middleware at \"middleware.js|ts\". However, `pageExtensions` can be updated in the user's configuration. In the documentation, it uses the examples \"page.ts\" and \"page.js\" which would mean middleware must be named \"middleware.page.js|ts\".\n\n### Does the docs page already exist? Please link to it.\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"icyJoseph","id":21013447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEzNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21013447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph","html_url":"https://github.com/icyJoseph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icyJoseph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/84008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/84008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
