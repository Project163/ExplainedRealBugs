Create new Next 15 project (with ESLint + TypeScript)\n2. run `npx @next/codemod@latest upgrade latest`\n3. run `npm install`\n4. Run `npm lint`\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n* expect: no errors.\n* got: error `Converting circular structure to JSON`\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\n/bin/sh: line 1: yarn: command not found\n/bin/sh: line 1: pnpm: command not found\n\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun Oct 12 16:31:16 UTC 2025\n  Available memory (MB): 31506\n  Available CPU cores: 20\nBinaries:\n  Node: 24.7.0\n  npm: 11.6.1\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: N/A\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 16.0.0 // Latest available version is detected (16.0.0).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.2.0\n  react-dom: 19.2.0\n  typescript: 5.9.2\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nLinting\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nnpm run lint\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'm not sure if this qualifies, but the codemod in documentation probably should update the ESLint file.\n\nThis can be fixed by create next 16 project and migrating the ESLint config.\n\nThis also turns out that this is a stacking error from ESLint. ESLint crash when trying to display the error:\n* https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20237\n\nIf nothing can be done to fix the old setup, I would expect this information to be included in the migration instruction:\n\n* https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16","closed_by":{"login":"devjiwonchoi","id":120007119,"node_id":"U_kgDOBycpzw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120007119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi","html_url":"https://github.com/devjiwonchoi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devjiwonchoi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85244/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/85244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
