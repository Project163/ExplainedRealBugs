Load the reproduction repo + follow setup instructions\n2. Click the link to \"Page 2\". Notice the hard browser navigation.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrent:\n- Pages router in dev mode with custom `assetPrefix` applied\n- Clicking a link to a new pages causes a hard navigation.\n  - First there is a request to the JS file for the page, e.g. `/custom-asset-prefix/_next/static/chunks/pages/page2.js`. This request results in a 404\n  - A hard navigation is performed\n  - The page loads correctly after the hard navigation\n- Sometimes a soft navigation happens on subsequent clicks (maybe if the cache is warm?)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adbf1863-4077-4630-bd6f-356fc10da70d)\n\nExpected:\n- Soft navigation is always performed in dev mode when an asset prefix is applied\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:23 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\n  Available memory (MB): 32768\n  Available CPU cores: 12\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.14.0\n  npm: 10.7.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\n  pnpm: 9.7.0\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.2.3 // Latest available version is detected (15.2.3).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.0.0\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\n  typescript: N/A\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
