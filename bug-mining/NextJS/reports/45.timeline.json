It's not entirely clear from the documentation that the encryption key affects the non-deterministic action IDs. If it does, that doesn't fully address this issue.\n\nEven if the encryption key is kept the same across builds it is still possible to get a different action ID and the client still has no way to recover when that happens.\n\nI couldn't find any documentation anywhere on how action IDs are generated. Is it some sort of hash involving the file name, function name, and the `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`? In this case renaming the file, renaming the function, moving anything, or even building on a new machine can change the action ID (say, if the action ID is generated with a full absolute path to the

The documentation isn’t clear enough on:\n- How this helps resolve different action IDs across builds\n- How to generate the custom encryption key\n\nThis has been really tough to troubleshoot since there are no client-side errors, no way to identify which action is causing it, and no way to track it down. We also can’t determine the user’s experience. We assume the action isn’t executed, leaving the app broken without any way to handle or provide feedback to the

What is the documentation issue?\n\nI think there's a lot of missing information about `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`:\n\n- Is this a build-time or runtime env var? [Or maybe both?](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/c97dff9ba1b7933240650461f7d1b1c285535628/packages/next/src/server/app-render/encryption-utils-server.ts#L76)\n- What is the exact format of the key? [A code snippet might be nice.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/61020#issuecomment-2095906151)\n- The statement \"This variable must be AES-GCM encrypted.\" doesn't clarify. I think what's meant here is something along the lines of \"This key is a server-side secret and should be treated accordingly. If it is compromised, an adversary could possibly use it to decrypt server-side secrets in payloads to the client.\"\n- More examples of exactly how this symmetric key is used to encrypt/decrypt payloads would be helpful. What exactly are the payloads? This can help Next.js users understand the consequences of a key leaking, etc.\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nN/A\n\n### Does the docs page already exist? Please link to it.\n\nhttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#overwriting-encryption-keys-advanced","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/75448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/75448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/2644382413","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/75541#issuecomment-2644382413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/75541","id":2644382413,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis6dnhLN","user":{"login":"samcx","id":28912696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTEyNjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28912696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx","html_url":"https://github.com/samcx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-08T00:41:00Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T00:42:31Z","body":"> Even if the encryption key is kept the same across builds it is still possible to get a different action ID and the client still has no way to recover when that happens.\n\n@knpwrs Did you confirm this with your reproduction?
