Start the application in development (`pnpm run dev`)\n2. Check the page and see 'FALSE' is rendered instead of 'TRUE'\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrent: 'FALSE' is rendered\nExpected: 'TRUE' should be rendered\n\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.4.0: Fri Apr 11 18:33:47 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.101.15~117/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\n  Available CPU cores: 10\nBinaries:\n  Node: 24.3.0\n  npm: 11.4.2\n  Yarn: N/A\n  pnpm: 10.12.4\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.0-canary.116 // There is a newer canary version (15.4.0-canary.119) available, please upgrade! \n  eslint-config-next: 15.4.0-canary.116\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.8.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nTurbopack\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nnext dev (local)\n\n### Additional context\n\nTurbopack does not recognise such pattern:\n\n```ts\nconst func = () => {\n  return { bool: true };\n};\n\nlet bool = false;\n\n({ bool } = func()); // This is not recognised\n```\n\nThis means `bool` variable will be reassigned. But turbopack will convert later usage of this\n\n```ts\nif(bool) {\n  // Whatever here\n  return 123;\n}\n```\n\nTo this:\n\n```js\nif (\"TURBOPACK compile-time falsy\", 0) //TURBOPACK unreachable\n    ;\n```\n\n<sub>[PACK-5051](https://linear.app/vercel/issue/PACK-5051/turbopack-eliminates-reachable-code-as-unreachable)</sub>","closed_by":{"login":"bgw","id":180404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDQwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw","html_url":"https://github.com/bgw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
