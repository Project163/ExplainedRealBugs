Have a moderately complex page to build (generateStaticParams + parallel routes)\r\n2. `next build`\r\n3. process will crash `JavaScript heap out of memory` (usually during the 'Collecting page data' step)\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n`next build` process doesn't crash.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 22.12.0\r\n  npm: 10.9.0\r\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\r\n  pnpm: 8.10.2\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 15.1.1-canary.0 // Latest available version is detected (15.1.1-canary.0).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 19.0.0\r\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\r\n  typescript: 5.3.3\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n(Also tested with node 20)\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nNot sure\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nnext build (local), Vercel (Deployed)\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe crash doesn't happen if I reduce the size of the array returned by `generateStaticParams` or if I remove a couple parallel routes. This happens on all platform I tested: Vercel, locally and on codesandbox.io.\r\nThis used to work correctly with `next@15.0.4`.","closed_by":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/73793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/73793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
