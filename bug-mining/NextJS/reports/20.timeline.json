What\r\n\r\nRe-insert the metadata icons under body tag into head tag to ensure they can be proper displayed.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\n* For chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and Safari, icons need to stay under `<head>` to be picked up by the browser. Firefox doesn't have this requirement.\r\n* Firefox will always render svg > icon > png, so it doesn't matter to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMade a test in https://icons-order-test.vercel.app/, you can play with the test cases here. These links can see the comparsion of the approach in the this PR.\r\n\r\nDuring deployment it's very hard to verify Safari as it's pretty broken. But deploymet works well.\r\nAfter we re-insert the icon from body into head, they can be properly displayed across all the browsers.\r\n\r\nNote: We insert the script during streaming rather than using a jsx element right after metadata to avoid the hydration errors\r\n\r\nCloses #76810\r\nCloses NDX-951\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/76915/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/76915/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/2707529505","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/76810#issuecomment-2707529505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/76810","id":2707529505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis6hYZ8h","user":{"login":"jjbeach","id":1248256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDgyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1248256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach","html_url":"https://github.com/jjbeach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjbeach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-07T21:52:50Z","updated_at":"2025-03-07T21:52:50Z","body":"I can also confirm this is a bug in Next 15.2. I'm observing it on Safari, too. \n\n@ryanburns23 I fixed this for our app by inserting vanilla favicon link elements in an App Router layout component where it was needed like so:\n\n```jsx\n{merchantThemeData?.faviconImageSrc && (\n  <>\n    <link\n      rel=\"icon\"\n      href={imageKitUrlBuilder({\n        path: merchantThemeData.faviconImageSrc,\n        width: 30,\n        height: \"30\",\n      })}\n      sizes=\"30x30\"\n    />\n    <link\n      rel=\"apple-touch-icon\"\n      href={imageKitUrlBuilder({\n        path: merchantThemeData.faviconImageSrc,\n        width: 180,\n        height: \"180\",\n      })}\n      sizes=\"180x180\"\n    />\n  </>\n)}\n```\nIt appears with this hack, server is compiling the favicon links it in `<head>`, but it's anti-pattern so hopefully this get's resolved soon @ztanner.
