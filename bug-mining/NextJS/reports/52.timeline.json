Yep, same one bug/error.\n> \n> Did you try installing geist? `npm install geist`\n> \n\nI ended up going down the local route, and just downloading then converting Lustiana to woff, putting into the fonts folder (where Geist is stored in the default template) and then importing it into layout.tsx:\n\n```\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local';\nimport '@/styles/main.css';\n\nconst lusitana = localFont({\n  src: [\n    {\n      path: './fonts/Lusitana-Regular.woff',\n      weight: '400',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './fonts/Lusitana-Bold.woff',\n      weight: '700',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n  ],\n  variable: '--font-lusitana',\n  display: 'swap',\n});\n```\nThat has it working for now. FWIW I tried again this morning to do the previous way and it was still returning the error from Google fonts. However as the above commenter has said, it looks like it is being caused by Turbopack because I just tried again WITHOUT using turbopack and the fonts are being fetched just fine. \n\nSo it looks like it is definitely Turbopack causing the issue...\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/3091308231/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PaulHaze","id":20569604,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY5NjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20569604?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze","html_url":"https://github.com/PaulHaze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulHaze/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/comments/3091466902","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/81697#issuecomment-3091466902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/81697","id":3091466902,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC3Cis64RAqW","user":{"login":"dev-schad","id":217372643,"node_id":"U_kgDODPTX4w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/217372643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad","html_url":"https://github.com/dev-schad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev-schad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-19T03:32:39Z","updated_at":"2025-07-19T03:32:39Z","body":"or
