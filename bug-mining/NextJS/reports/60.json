What is the documentation issue?\n\nThe code snippet provided in the documentation for [File Conventions > Metadata > OpenGraph Image > Using Node.JS runtime with local assets](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image#using-nodejs-runtime-with-local-assets) has Typescript errors.\n\nHere is that code snippet:\n```tsx\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\nimport { join } from 'node:path'\nimport { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'\n \nexport default async function Image() {\n  const logoData = await readFile(join(process.cwd(), 'logo.png'))\n  const logoSrc = Uint8Array.from(logoData).buffer\n \n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          display: 'flex',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        <img src={logoSrc} height=\"100\" />\n      </div>\n    )\n  )\n}\n```\nand here is the error:\n> Type 'ArrayBuffer' is not assignable to type 'string'.ts(2322)\n> \n> index.d.ts(3051, 9): The expected type comes from property 'src' which is declared here on type 'DetailedHTMLProps<ImgHTMLAttributes, HTMLImageElement>'\n> \n> ⚠ Error (TS2322) | Type ArrayBuffer is not assignable to type string.\n> \n> (property) ImgHTMLAttributes.src?: string | undefined\n\nI made a [reproduction repository](https://github.com/shawninder/opengraph-type-error-repro) by running `npx create-next-app@latest opengraph-type-error-repro` and copy-pasting the snippet from docs.\n\nYou can see the type error by opening [src/app/opengraph-image.tsx](https://github.com/shawninder/opengraph-type-error-repro/blob/main/src/app/opengraph-image.tsx) in a Typescript-enabled editor or by running `npm i && npm run build`.\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nHere is the output of `npx next info` if it helps:\n```\n$ npx next info\n/bin/sh: pnpm: command not found\n\nOperating
