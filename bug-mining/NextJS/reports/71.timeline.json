What?\r\n\r\nFixes the `FormatDetectionMeta` function so that it correctly respects true vs false values.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nPreviously, both true and false values output key=no. According to Apple’s spec, Safari defaults to enabling detection when the tag is absent, and only no should be added when explicitly disabled.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\n- Now false → outputs key=no\r\n- true → omits the tag (defaults to Safari’s behavior)\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n\r\n-  [Apple docs on format-detection](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008193-SW1)\r\n\r\nFixes #83666
