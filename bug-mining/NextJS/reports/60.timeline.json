We need a link to a **public** GitHub repository ([template for App Router](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template), [template for Pages Router](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template-pages)), but you can also use these templates: [CodeSandbox: App Router](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template) or [CodeSandbox: Pages Router](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template-pages).\n\nThe bug template that you filled out has a section called \"Link to the code that reproduces this issue\", which is where you should provide the link to the reproduction.\n\n- If you did not provide a link or the link you provided is not valid, we will close the issue.\n- If you provide a link to a private repository, we will close the issue.\n- If you provide a link to a repository but not in the correct section, we will close the issue.\n\n### What should I do?\n\nDepending on the reason the issue was closed, you can do the following:\n\n- If you did not provide a link, please open a new issue with a link to a reproduction.\n- If you provided a link to a private repository, please open a new issue with a link to a public repository.\n- If you provided a link to a repository but not in the correct section, please open a new issue with a link to a reproduction in the correct section.\n\n**In general, assume that we should not go through a lengthy onboarding process at your company code only to be able to verify an issue.**\n\n### My repository is private and cannot make it public\n\nIn most cases, a private repo will not be a sufficient **minimal reproduction**, as this codebase might contain a lot of unrelated parts that would make our investigation take longer. Please do **not** make it public. Instead, create a new repository using the templates above, adding the relevant code to reproduce the issue. Common things to look out for:\n\n- Remove any code that is not related to the issue. (pages, API routes, components, etc.)\n- Remove any dependencies that are not related to the issue.\n- Remove any third-party service that would require us to sign up for an account to reproduce the issue.\n- Remove any environment variables that are not related to the issue.\n- Remove private packages that we do not have access to.\n- If the issue is not related to a monorepo specifically, try to reproduce the issue without a complex monorepo setup\n\n### I did not open this issue, but it is relevant to me, what can I do to help?\n\nAnyone experiencing the same issue is welcome to provide a minimal reproduction following the above steps by opening a new issue.\n\n### I think my reproduction is good enough, why aren't you looking into it quickly?\n\nWe look into every Next.js issue and constantly monitor open issues for new comments.\n\nHowever, sometimes we might miss one or two due to the popularity/high traffic of the repository. We apologize, and kindly ask you to refrain from tagging core maintainers, as that will usually not result in increased priority.\n\nUpvoting issues to show your interest will help us prioritize and address them as quickly as possible. That said, every issue is important to us, and if an issue gets closed by accident, we encourage you to open a new one linking to the old issue and we will look into it.\n\n### Useful Resources\n\n-

Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/shawninder/opengraph-type-error\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Clone the reproduction repository: `git clone git@github.com:shawninder/opengraph-type-error.git`\n2. Install the dependencies: `npm i`\n3. Build the app: `npm run build`\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nI expected the build to succeed, but I observed instead that the build fails due to a Typescript error:\n\n```sh\n$ npm run build\n\n> build\n> next build\n\n   ▲ Next.js 15.2.0-canary.37\n\n   Creating an optimized production build ...\n ✓ Compiled successfully\n   Linting and checking validity of types  .Failed to compile.\n\n./app/opengraph-image.tsx:18:14\nType error: Type 'ArrayBuffer' is not assignable to type 'string'.\n\n  16 |         }}\n  17 |       >\n> 18 |         <img src={logoSrc} height=\"100\" />\n     |              ^\n  19 |       </div>\n  20 |     )\n  21 |   )\nStatic worker exited with code: 1 and signal: null\n```\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\n/bin/sh: pnpm: command not found\n\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0: Mon Jun 24 00:56:10 PDT 2024; root:xnu-8020.240.18.709.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\n  Available CPU cores: 8\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.12.0\n  npm: 11.0.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.10\n  pnpm: N/A\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.2.0-canary.37 // Latest available version is detected (15.2.0-canary.37).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.0.0\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\n  typescript: 5.7.3\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nTypeScript, Metadata\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nnext build (local)\n\n### Additional context\n\nI generated the reproduction repository using `npx create-next-app -e reproduction-template`.\nThen, I copy-pasted the code snippet provided in the documentation for [File Conventions > Metadata > OpenGraph Image > Using Node.JS runtime with local assets](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image#using-nodejs-runtime-with-local-assets) into a new file: [app/opengraph-image.tsx](https://github.com/shawninder/opengraph-type-error/blob/main/app/opengraph-image.tsx).\n\nThe snippet expects the existence of a `logo.png` so I added an image with that name in the root of the repository: [logo.png](https://github.com/shawninder/opengraph-type-error/blob/main/logo.png).\n\n----\n\nI initially tried to [report this as a documentation issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/75583#event-16154434180) but that was automatically closed because github-actions \"could not detect a valid reproduction link\". The automated message says:\n\n> The bug template that you filled out has a section called \"Link to the code that reproduces this issue\", which is where you should provide the link to the reproduction\n\nbut this isn't true: the documentation issue template doesn't have this section.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/75625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/75625/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16232028130,"node_id":"RTE_lADOBC3Cis6oc48fzwAAAAPHgRfi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/events/16232028130","actor":{"login":"samcx","id":28912696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTEyNjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28912696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx","html_url":"https://github.com/samcx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samcx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-08T01:00:21Z","rename":{"from":"Docs:","to":"Docs:

What?  \r\nUpdated the documentation for `opengraph-image` / `twitter-image` to fix the **Node.js runtime with local assets** example.    \r\n\r\n## Why?  \r\nThe existing snippet did not type-check cleanly with Next.js 15+ and could confuse developers.  \r\nThis update improves developer experience by ensuring the snippet is immediately usable and accurate.  \r\n\r\n## How?  \r\n- Reproduced the example in a fresh Next.js 15+ project.  \r\n- Updated the docs example to:  \r\n  - Use `readFile` + Base64 encoding instead of invalid file URLs.  \r\n  - Clarify that assets should be placed relative to the project root.  \r\n- Added an entry to **Version History** noting the update in v15.x.  \r\n\r\n## Checklist  \r\n- [x] Ran `pnpm prettier-fix`  \r\n- [x] Verified formatting & linting (`pnpm build && pnpm lint`)  \r\n- [x] Documentation guidelines followed  \r\n- [x] Example verified in a real Next.js 15 project  \r\n\r\nFixes #75583 & #75625 (if considered same class of issue)
