In version 8, the `stylePreprocessorOptions` was picked from whatever entry was configured as `browserTarget` in Storybook.\n\nThe config should work as in previous versions to avoid duplications.\n \n\n\n### Reproduction link\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-gwmqb3tb?file=angular.json\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\nIn the reproduction link I have the config for `stylePreprocessorOptions.includePaths` duplicated under `storybook` and 'angular-latest:build', if you remove the config from `storybook`, the `@use` at the `button.scss` will stop working as intended.\n\n### System\n\n```bash\nStorybook Environment Info:\n\n  System:\n    OS: macOS 15.5\n    CPU: (12) arm64 Apple M2 Max\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 20.19.3 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.3/bin/node\n    npm: 10.8.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.3/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.7.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.3/bin/pnpm <----- active\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 138.0.7204.158\n    Safari: 18.5\n  npmPackages:\n    @storybook/addon-docs: ^9.0.17 => 9.0.17 \n    @storybook/addon-links: ^9.0.17 => 9.0.17 \n    @storybook/angular: ^9.0.17 => 9.0.17 \n    chromatic: ^11.5.0 => 11.27.0 \n    eslint-plugin-storybook: ^9.0.17 => 9.0.17 \n    storybook: ^9.0.17 => 9.0.17 \n    storybook-addon-pseudo-states: ^9.0.17 => 9.0.17\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"valentinpalkovic","id":5889929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk5Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic","html_url":"https://github.com/valentinpalkovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/32105/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/32105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
