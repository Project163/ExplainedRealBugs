refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing in `/code/addons/test/src/node/test-manager.ts` to prevent channel overload\n- Added new `useTestProvider` hook in `/code/addons/test/src/use-test-provider-state.ts` for unified test state management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing in `/code/addons/test/src/node/test-manager.ts` to prevent channel overload\n- Added new `useTestProvider` hook in `/code/addons/test/src/use-test-provider-state.ts` for unified test state management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing

management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing

management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing in `/code/addons/test/src/node/test-manager.ts` to prevent channel overload\n- Added new `useTestProvider` hook in `/code/addons/test/src/use-test-provider-state.ts` for unified test state management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment
