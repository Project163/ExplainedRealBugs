This leads to navigating directly to nonexistent pages after clicking the link. \n\nThis behavior does not occur with Next.js 14.\n\n### Reproduction link\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-6hzs76ok?file=src%2Fstories%2FHeader.tsx\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Go to the above link\n2. Go to a story of the Header component\n3. Click the link on the header, and the preview will crush\n\n### System\n\n```bash\nStorybook Environment Info:\n\n  System:\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 18.20.3 - /usr/local/bin/node\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\n    npm: 10.2.3 - /usr/local/bin/npm <----- active\n    pnpm: 8.15.6 - /usr/local/bin/pnpm\n  npmPackages:\n    @storybook/addon-essentials: ^8.6.0-alpha.2 => 8.6.0-alpha.2 \n    @storybook/addon-interactions: ^8.6.0-alpha.2 => 8.6.0-alpha.2 \n    @storybook/addon-onboarding: ^8.6.0-alpha.2 => 8.6.0-alpha.2 \n    @storybook/blocks: ^8.6.0-alpha.2 => 8.6.0-alpha.2 \n    @storybook/nextjs: ^8.6.0-alpha.2 => 8.6.0-alpha.2 \n    @storybook/react: ^8.6.0-alpha.2 => 8.6.0-alpha.2 \n    @storybook/test: ^8.6.0-alpha.2 => 8.6.0-alpha.2 \n    storybook: ^8.6.0-alpha.2 => 8.6.0-alpha.2\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n[Proper behavior with Next.js 14](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-scn3vgkf?file=src%2Fstories%2FHeader.tsx,src%2Fstories%2FHeader.stories.ts&preset=node)","closed_by":{"login":"valentinpalkovic","id":5889929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk5Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic","html_url":"https://github.com/valentinpalkovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/30390/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/30390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
