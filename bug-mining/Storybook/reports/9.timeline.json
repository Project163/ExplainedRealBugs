Instead of using a variable (\"prevManagerLayoutStateRef\") that was also modified by another function (\"useEffect()\") that could execute at the same time, it now uses a variable that is only modified by the own function, ensuring that the supposed layout values are not changed after they are set.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/assets/133528288/35c4ebcb-2549-4bcd-97e3-471ec30042cd\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Briefly describe what your PR does -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\n_This section is mandatory for all contributions.
